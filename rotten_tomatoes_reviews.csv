Freshness,Review
2," Manakamana doesn't answer any questions, yet makes its point: Nepal, like the rest of our planet, is a picturesque but far from peaceable kingdom."
2," Wilfully offensive and powered by a chest-thumping machismo, but it's good clean fun."
0, It would be difficult to imagine material more wrong for Spade than Lost & Found.
1," Despite the gusto its star brings to the role, it's hard to ride shotgun on Hector's voyage of discovery."
0," If there was a good idea at the core of this film, it's been buried in an unsightly pile of flatulence jokes, dog-related bad puns and a ridiculous serial arson plot."
0," Gleeson goes the Hallmark Channel route, damaging an intermittently curious entry in the time travel subgenre."
2," It was the height of satire in 2976: dark as hell, but patently absurd and surely nowhere close to objective reality. Objective reality surpassed it somewhere in the Jerry Springer era."
1," Everyone in ""The Comedian"" deserves a better movie than ""The Comedian."""
0, Actor encourages grumpy Christians to embrace the season.
2," Slight, contained, but ineffably soulful."
2," Bell's debut feature addresses its subject with both humor and intelligence, approaching the issue of performance enhancement from every conceivable angle"
2," ... except for its shamelessly (and irresistibly) zingy music score (by the director), Halloween achieves its considerable power almost entirely through visual means."
0, This is not one for the uninitiated. It's also not one for people who like action and thrills.
2," Son of Saul employs the formal mechanics of filmmaking to turn [its] ... questions back in on and around themselves, doing what cinema does best in the hands of great filmmakers: showing by not showing, telling by not telling."
0, It isn't thrilling. Fox can't act. The backchat is more filthy than funny.
1," Hiddleston and Swinton are lovely to watch, but they need more to chew on than this."
2," Yossi is a stronger film than its predecessor, more deeply felt and less reliant on love-story conventions."
2, I feel like a Sparkle Baby just puked rainbow-colored dust all over my head. 
0," Long, unfocused film."
2, Kubo and the Two Strings is better than immersive -- it's absorptive. We're pulled in Knight's direction; we become part of his studio's technical wizardry.
1," Easy to enjoy, if you're at all susceptible to this sort of thing, but it leaves you with nothing to think about, except for all the opportunities Brooks missed to make something worthwhile out of the material."
2," An extraordinary blast from the past, X-Men: First Class will go down as one of this decade's best superhero movies."
2," Mostly lightweight, but the most interesting part of the movie is Jamie Foxx as Electro. This villain embodies black rage, more Malcolm X than mutant."
2," Drawn, per a disclaimer, from period accounts of strange phenomena and psychotic breaks among settlers, Eggers's impeccably crafted, historically accurate creepshow wears its deep-dive research on its tattered gingham sleeves."
2, ... hones its dramatic elements to emotional effect rather than fall back on a slasher film template... Moretz brings her A-game...
1," What seemed like a decent idea - a fourth and final stroll through the American Pie gutter - is swamped by the reason why most of these actors haven't worked much between sequels. They simply aren't special, or even that good at what they're doing."
0," Free Birds is unappealingly staged and paced with an uneven sluggishness. It begs the question: since things always seem to be happening, why is it all so crushingly dull?"
1," A joyless, misanthropic 205 minutes worth of ""comedy"" that rates as Coen brothers at their worst. How one can take such a marvelous period and turn it into a voyage into hell is an imponderable mystery to this critic."
0," This one, directed by John Glen, just follows the numbers, plodding from one unimaginative set piece to the next."
2," The movie is purely visceral, generating adrenaline, alarm, and even tears. Berg manages to avoid high-minded seriousness while still respecting the material. "
0," Peppermint could have been at least good trash, but it decides to be an awkwardly-paced exercise in shallowness. If you want a high body count, step right in, but brains behind the brawns are sorely missed."
2," While the hidden agenda that eventually surfaces does strain credibility, Foster's ability to reign in the improbable ... allows this flight to deliver the requisite thrills."
2," As a romantic comedy, this film has nothing new to offer except the rise of a new comedy star, Awkwafina. "
2," Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes."
0, Estevez means well. But having your heart in the right place is no excuse for insipid ineptitude.
2," Ralston seems to love living his life on the ragged edge of disaster, and Boyle's filmmaking rides that same narrow edge, to breathtaking effect."
2," The film works fine as stand-alone entertainment, but does irreparable harm to the series as a whole."
2," It's not that ""Hangover II"" is a notably bad movie. It's more that nothing in it seems to justify all the effort spent to add a new but nearly identical series of episodes to the original."
2," You simply haven't had this much fun at the multiplex in a long, long time."
2, Amy Sedaris suits up as everyone's favorite former-prostitute/drug addict-turned-high school student in the long-awaited--and quite funny--big-screen version of the cult TV series.
2," We see unadorned faces staring at the camera; afternoon shadows moving across a large, institutional-looking building; forlorn images of an abandoned amusement park; the misty, magical quiet of a swamp."
2," Throughout the documentary are gorgeous images of teenagers with goofy, full-of-hope smiles that make your heart ache."
2, A beautifully shot but aggressively menacing film that is at turns irresistibly sumptuous and hide-your-eyes-behind-your-hands disturbing.
0, The concept is much cooler than the execution.
2," Both [Gyllenhaal and Ledger] embody what that old Waylon and Willie song taught us -- 'Cowboys ain't easy to love, and they're harder to hold.'"
2," An unsubtle film for unsubtle times, all the better for not backing down with what it's trying to say or how it says it."
0," One long, extensively choreographed fight sequence in which ""mortal"" blows are delivered so often, and with so little lasting impact, that a brawl just becomes a brawl becomes a brawl."
2," One of Bergman's undisputed masterpieces is a seminal work of psychonalayis and metacinema, raising more complex questions about identity and role-playing than it could possibly answer, thus deliberately encouraging ambivalence and ambiguity."
0," Somehow that revolutionary, empowering message never got through to Dunn. His film seems sexually and psychologically arrested in the pathology that blocks coming out."
2," ... a frothy girl-power manifesto so briskly paced, sharply written and infectiously entertaining that its deficiencies seem as insignificant as a lightly chipped fingernail."
0, It's so disappointing for the director of Rosemary's Baby to have to stoop to something as desperate as pyrotechnics and nudity.
0, The film is put together too choppily to appreciate the bounce-off-walls athleticism of parkour.
0, Confirms the perception that only losers attend high-school reunions.
0," If Younger truly wanted to work out some fantasies on the big screen, Prime is the dullest, most unimaginative way he could've achieved that goal."
0," You can always expect a little embellishment for any horror film or thriller that claims to be based on a true story or actual events. This one, however, doesn't sell it."
0," Merely an excuse for the viewer to delight in the hilarity generated by Mr. Cable Guy breaking wind, vomiting, producing various gastric noises, etc."
2," On its own, 'Enough Said' is a sweet and charming little movie - but there's no question the loss of its beloved leading man lends the picture extra, unexpected pathos."
0," The story might perhaps be adequate for an animated film for children, with Thor, Odin and the others played by piglets. In the arena of movies about comic book superheroes, it is a desolate vastation."
2," While short on fresh ideas, the film works thanks to some strong performances and a script that provides just enough depth to render its characters more than just a collection of eccentricities."
1," If you thought the Oscar-winning 2004 drama Crash was heavy-handed, just wait until you see Crossing Over."
1," As fresh as [Gatlif's] view of flamenco may be, his dramatic ideas are excruciatingly trite."
0, What a mountain of crap this movie is.
2," When [it] remembers that it's supposed to be a sweet piece of hokum, when it has the wit to leave Attenborough and Wilson on the screen together and forget about its rash of putative improvements, it does offer well-scrubbed family fare."
0," The sex scenes are pretty hot, though their power is diminished by the characters' limited intelligence."
2, Perfectly enjoyable but perfectly forgettable.
2," The general playful tone... helps a great deal, and the cinematography and editing are appealingly glossy and smooth throughout."
0," It is, despite Spielberg's claims, neither a purehearted popcorn flick nor a Paul Verhoevenesque subversion, but something uneasily in between, cowed by the idea of the fanboy demographic."
2," For all its political pelting, this is most gripping when it focuses on the innocent people whose lives have been destroyed either by the terrorists or by this administration."
0," We have the feeling that Kemp/Thompson saw much of life through the bottom of a dirty glass and did not experience it with any precision. The film duplicates this sensation, not with much success."
0, A reconstituted blend of Ghostbusters meets Men In Black with a pinch of The X-Files.
2," While it's true that the problems of two little people don't amount to more than a hill of beans in Stalin's USSR, they're real enough to the people experiencing them. We feel for them, even if the world can't."
0," A doublethink cash grab, painting perpetrator as saviour and exploited victims on the fringes of society as empowering role models - figures of inspiration to make mainstream, uncritical audiences feel better about themselves."
2, Aire is a film about Mother Courage. [Full review in Spanish]
2, It might be best to let the big guy live happily ever after.
0, The film is so wadded full with ideas that they come squishing out the sides.
2," Much of the heavy lifting falls to Watson, and, in such moments as the one where she must wipe out her family's memories of her to protect them, she is more than up to the task."
2," Navel-gazing and listless, Mary Magdalene is nevertheless an affecting, contemplative hagiography of a biblical figure which is more inclined towards an arthouse aesthetic than anything in the ""faith-based"" sub-genre."
0," Lawrence reunites with her 'Hunger Games' director for a sadistic, sexed-up, Russian spy saga that is one long ""Nyet."" "
2," Made almost 50 years ago, the black-and-white French classic still grabs you by the throat."
2," The actors, particularly Seyfried and Redgrave, help make the movie's romantic spirit contagious."
0," While there are some nicely gory moments, the film feels rather uninspired ..."
0, A handsomely photographed movie of little consequence.
2, Damon is superbly silly in this comic version of A Beautiful Mind.
0," The film's greatest mystery turns out to be: Why, with so much talent, does Dark Water never cross the tipping point?"
0, What hurts it is Spielberg's dogged insistence on turning it into yet another of his seemingly endless middle-brow meditations on the travails of the middle-class family.
0, Krampus is a toothless film on several levels.
0," Trite characters, very well-worn clichés of SF cinema, and a mystery that is completely transparent. All about production design, and even that is familiar."
0, Another beautifully-made and serious-minded celebration of having nothing to say.
2," You'll never hear the phrase ""Mind the doors"" in the same way again."
2," It's clear that these guys were just having some fun making a movie, and that fun they had translates onto screen perfectly. "
2," Despite being marketed as historical fiction King Arthur story, this film is actually a high octane full on fantasy film that showcases Excalibur guiding Arthur to his destiny. And it's thrilling! "
0, The plot doesn't hold up but the chemistry between the two leads does
2," A breezy hour-and-ten-minutes long, this beautifully affecting film is less about these beloved characters than its aging filmmaker's wistful reminiscences of cinema itself and a long lifetime's worth of material pleasures."
2," If we can operate at the genius level in a given field, does that mean we must -- even if the cost is the sort of endless purgatory a Bobby Fischer has inhabited? It's an interesting question, and this movie doesn't avoid it."
2," Essential to maintaining the powerful atmospherics is the superb cast, which includes Nicole Kidman as the surgeon's unsuspecting wife."
2," What grounds the spectacle, pushing it beyond a two-hour ejaculation of sensation, is its yearning for innocence"
2, The performances are uniformly excellent.
0," The truth is that this film is mostly plain work, done by rote, like any introductory potions class. The real fun -- and thrills and tears -- come next year."
2," Capturing that particular age group, of those in their late 20s and early 30s, entering into adulthood with a certain reluctance and trepidation."
1, Ballard's sumptuous images exist only to distract from his rather conventional failings of craftsmanship.
2, Bring the spouse and live vicariously. 
0, Hickenlooper seems unsure what he wants his film to be. Is it a mid-life crisis film? Is it a marriage-in-trouble film? Or is it really classy neo-porn lite?
2," Kudos to Cuaron for crafting such a visually-captivating, surreal memoir of his troubled coming of age! "
0," Crass, offensive, vulgar, inane: there aren't enough adjectives to effectively convey the endless agony that is Humshakals."
2, Zootopia is filled with lovable characters and a heartfelt message for kids - along with a layered subtext for adults that is both timely and moving. 
0," The grand statement it wants to make plays shallow instead of deep, leaving the film too weak-kneed to carry the weight of its broken world."
2," This is a wilder, bigger thing than just another farmyard sink drama. There may be little you haven't seen elsewhere, but there's no denying the skill here."
2," Deliberate, uncompromising, and very sad, Bob Clark's quiet masterpiece is still one of the most inspired anti-war genre pics out there."
0, This self-promoting Hollywood film wants everyone to feel good about Hollywood...
0," Another empty, heavily voice-overed perfume commercial."
2," Pity the crowds expecting another cute comedy like ""Date Night"" who wind up at ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" It'll be like asking for a burger and getting served escargot."
2," Like McCarthy's book, The Road is dark, bleak and nightmarish but also stirring and beautiful and optimistic: As long as life remains, the movie argues, there is always hope."
0," Just isn't clever or surprising enough: it's complicated but conventional, strikes no sparks...[and] fails to juggle its myriad tones successfully."
2," ... sharply observed, with an endearing quirky sense of humor and a genuine affection for its setting."
2," My mutant power (and the boxoffice tingle of $299 Million in one week) tells me ""The Last Stand"" is anything but last. It's not even likely to be penultimate."
0," Whatever Muse drives Malick, whose best work feels both found - in the sense of discovered in the shoot and edit - and profound, he could be accused of cheating on her in Knight of Cups, leapfrogging between unsatisfactory short-term conquests."
2," An endearingly straightforward, intimate character study and one that remains wholly relatable."
2," McDonagh has a way with a line that is without compare, and he has put together a cast who knows how to sock it home. Harrelson is excellent with a character who also takes unexpected turns that we aren't prepared for."
2," Irons and Patel create a bit of magic with their mathematical dance, so even when Brown's script bogs down in cliché and the female characters are swept into the corner of every scene, the viewer has something meaty to process."
0, An emotionally devastating documentary [...] falls apart toward the end when it loses all objectivity and descends into hagiography.
2, The easy charm of stars Miles Teller and Analeigh Tipton more than compensates for a screenplay that never quite bridges the divide between old-fashioned romance and the cruder tone that seems par for the course in modern comedy.
0, Simply awful...like a SyFy Network Saturday night special that's inexplicably escaped to the big screen.
2," You need to give ""Love Is Strange"" your eyes and ears and attention, let it work its effects on you gradually, like the lovely Chopin piano music that forms the spine of its soundtrack."
2, A convoluted tale of corruption within the ranks of the police
2, A Japanese film that draws out our respect and compassion for a man whose life is turned upside down by the early onset of Alzheimer's.
0, The worst film ever made in Scotland ...
0," One can't help but feel that the Disney-Depp partnership has taken the series as far as it can go in this form, and short of a large-scale overhaul of the franchise, it may be best to set these particular Pirates adrift for good."
1, Leaves behind almost as many derisive laughs as dead bodies.
0," The film moves at a snails pace and while it shows off a lot of beautiful scenery, it takes about 30 minutes for something to happen outside of the initial hubbaloo that sets Charlotte off in the first place."
0, The nice way to put it is to say it's the second best film of the franchise. It's also accurate to say that it's a pale imitation of the original that's worse on every level. 
2," Yes, you've seen much of it before, and the nervous James character is now officially a cliché. But Stewart makes you care anyway. This, folks, is an actress."
0, This isn't a movie. It's a Broadway musical captured on film.
2, a genuinely moving exploration of a complex mother-daughter relationship
0," Headstrong women might have been hard to find in turn-of-the-century Europe, but heroines like Tautou's are a dime a dozen in costume dramas, and there isn't enough material detailing what makes her Chanel a special case."
0," When the finale of your movie involves a twenty-minute fantasy battle between role-playing enthusiasts, it is safe to say you have lost your way."
0," An intriguing erotic thriller undone by a silly, generic ending."
0," Limp anthology has brief nudity, language, adult themes. "
2," It may be slight, but it's also very funny, occasionally insightful, and a welcome throwback to those hallowed school daze."
0, Penelope Cruz is outstanding in an otherwise lame male fantasy.
2," Bold and innovative, spiritually challenging--and some heads get chopped off."
0," It's a movie by dog lovers, for dog lovers, that's more concerned with being cute and cuddly than providing any meaningful insight or substance."
0," Not knowing whether to be a comedy or a drama and often failing at both, there's very little to recommend about this downer of a movie."
2, A warm and fun crowd pleaser.
0," Reeves y Bullock no interpretan el papel de su vida, sin embargo cumplen con las expectativas del público en un producto ligero de fin de semana."
2," The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that speaks to our times, and it is saying some very important things if we care to listen."
2," Ridley Scott's not made his third sci-fi masterpiece, but boy, has he come close."
0," Predictable romcom send-up has racy sex scenes, language."
0," In action, the film is breathtaking, but as a whole it suffers from a relative lack of ambition."
2, What in lesser hands could have become an immaculately observed period piece instead soars to creative heights with its literate and knowing script.
0," After the setup, the air leaks out of the movie, flattening its momentum with about an hour to go."
2," Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie perfectly captures the goofy spirit of its source material. Plus, it has a theme song performed by Weird Al, so how can it go wrong?"
2," The Great Wall is not a groundbreaking film by any means, but at least it's fun"
0, (Scott) Derrickson uses a visual sledgehammer. That tilts everything toward horror and dilutes the terrifying power of the supernatural darkness. 
0," For all the fast cuts, the furious vibes, the faux sexiness, Torque is canned and mighty flat."
0, Rarely has a film felt so literally like a chore to watch.
0," In a word, it's soulless."
0," When the universe ""expands"" in this way, it actually makes it seem so much smaller."
0," Mind-numbing, formulaic twaddle."
2, Dafoe proves to have the right blend of ruggedness and sensitivity for this conflicted hero.
2," High-class hokum 600,000 feet in orbit"
2, The story's metaphysical slant lends the proceedings a haunting and ruminative air.
0," Phoenix has great production value, some nice special effects, some good acting, but overall impact wanes more than waxes. Long on time, short on internal struggle."
0," Expands a two-minute viral video into a feature-length dry procedural of city permits, bitty bat costumes, street closures and savvy social promotion"
2," If Bon Voyage ... didn't satiate your desire for films about the Nazi occupation of France in World War II, you're in luck. Another one has washed up on our shores, and it's even better."
2, The sequel to the most startling box-office smash of recent years collapses over the finishing line with barely a breath of air still in its lungs.
2," This document is a testament of the past, when things were done differently: The funny clothes, technical mishaps, AV effects and the fortunate non-existence of smartphones blocking the experience. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," The movie Proud Mary might not be anything special in itself, but its heroine sure as hell is."
2," If you take even the slightest interest in politics, book for The Accidental Prime Minister now. It is a film that takes you through an important era in Indian politics and is also entertaining. "
2," An animated film that takes familiar Disney archetypes and twists them into vivid, imaginative shapes."
2," One of those genre-defying hybrids that are sometimes called dramedies, The Savages tiptoes along a particularly fraught emotional tightrope, balancing observant humor and deep sadness with uncommon grace."
0," The movie is eerily photographed, but never suspenseful or scary, and eventually, events descend into goat-sacrificing silliness."
0, Details feel wrong; the pace is skittish; the rise to fatal hysteria is rapid and unconvincing. Finally you just lose all faith in it.
2," This is one of those ""why-oh-why?"" movies where you want to turn away from the terrible decisions unfolding on screen - but can't."
0, This is a tedious tale badly told.
2," Despite all the outrageous comedy and raunchy bathroom jokes, [the Zuckers] create endearing characters that are likable."
0, Perfectly serviceable B-movie noir.
2," for lovers of all things violent and vengeful, The Equalizer is a treat"
0," A well-acted, but overlong, clunky, and underwhelming satire. "
0," It's a horror-comedy without much horror or comedy, because the seriousness of the protagonists' baggage saps away most of the humor, and the laid back filmmaking undercuts any opportunity for scares."
0," ""Suffragette"" feels like a documentary in its visuals, but at the same time drowns in subjectivity."
2, It's an amazing and touching true story that will have you on the edge of your seat and may even cause you to shed a tear or two.
0, A muddled revenge crime drama.
0," If there's a movie worse than this set for release this year, let's hope the distributor has the good sense not to do it."
0," It's a middle-of-the-road anthology but boasts great energy and a sense of humor that runs throughout, helping make even the mediocre entries watchable."
2," It's clean, has all the requisite eye candy and slapstick for the younger set, and -- most distinguishing of all -- an uncommon level of sophistication for the adults."
2," More informative than emotional, the documentary catches some of the angst involved in such an undertaking, but always appears to be engaging with the subjects at a respectful arm's length."
0," Structurally and narratively amputated, Volume 2 retains head and guts but loses its heart and gams to the second installment."
0," Much like the onslaught of sword-and-sandal epics, the comic-book-adaptation boom has resulted in a decreased effectiveness of the subjects."
0, David Frost's soft approach to Nixon got results. This doesn't.
2," The plot device of ""woman in trouble meets woman triumphant"" has grown a little long in the tooth lately but that doesn't mean it doesn't work."
2," On the whole, War is both a reasonable possible conclusion to the ape's arc and a solid preparation for whatever comes next."
0," Even though the film is marketed as a road movie for kids, it barely has any road in it and that's just the least of its flaws. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, A movie about the difficulties of being a teenager and the main problems that affect Mexican society with amazing performances. [Full review in Spanish]
2," A one-of-a-kind experience that will confound, befuddle and amaze."
2," The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking, sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history."
2," There are no surprises in this story, only the anticipation of justice being done one bad guy at a time until the final showdown."
0," Louis Zamperini's life would make a great movie, if only somebody knew how to make it."
2," A sweet, often poignant little film."
2," As an observer of the various dimensions and dynamics of families, [director Kore-eda Hirokazu] is a modern master."
0," Girault presents situations through an extreme romantized lense, full of warmness, dim lights and lacking any comunication or beleivability for the characters and the spectator. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Rest assured, these crises will be resolved, and Helen will be enriched by the experiences. But going through them with her throws more sugar into your system than I can take."
1," It's not the actors that are the problem, it's the material they've been given. The dialogue, the antiquated sense of humor, the obviousness of so many plot mechanics."
2," Hunt for the Wilderpeople masks its earnest sweetness with a giggling distrust of authority, making it at once heartfelt and mischievous."
0, We spend 200 years developing an art form that breaks out of the musty auditoria of the 29th century and where does it get us? Right back where we started.
2," The auteur sees himself in the aviator, whose competence makes believers out of skeptics and who - in a critique of effects-driven blockbuster filmmaking - argues that 'computer simulations' mean nothing when divorced from the 'human' element. "
0, Defiance groans under the weight of its deadly earnestness: it's handsomely mounted yet strangely inert.
2," A brilliant follow up to Bispuri's ambitious debut, Daughter of Mine is an expertly crafted, richly told meditation on mother/daughter dynamics and what those roles truly mean"
0," The story hasn't changed much, nor have the characters. But the comedy is now crude instead of whimsical and its characters overblown caricatures instead of screwball personalities. A movie has been reduced to a sketch."
2," Gibney's movies are professional and solidly executed, informative if you go in underinformed but rarely surprising or aesthetically noteworthy."
2," A wonderfully quiet, serene portrait of Carthusian life edited to reflect the rhythm of the monastic regimen."
0," Like so many films by SNL alumni, it struggles to keep up the pace, and a few good scenes - or skits - are all you get."
2, It's pretty special stuff as offered up by Donoghue and director Lenny Abrahamson.
0," Musketeers isn't the worst picture Anderson has made in the last decade, but it's depressingly representative of his work -- he's always eager to dazzle, but clueless on how to engage."
0, Sentimental dreck of the fluffiest order.
0," This may be the best movie he's made. It's in French, by the way."
0," So cautious in dealing with the subject matter, so anxious to avoid the slightest hint of sensationalism, that it ends up exceedingly attractive to look at but curiously bland dramatically. "
0," ""In Dubious Battle"" marks an embrace of a kind of anonymous, fuddy-duddy traditionalist approach. In short, it's maybe James Franco's best-crafted film to date, and also maybe his dullest."
2, Has enough memorably disturbing images to stick in viewers' minds without any explanation needed.
2, (Tsui Hark's) romp plays exactly like the Sino-centric spin on an Indiana Jones adventure that its title suggests it should.
2, Matches documentary authenticity with dramatic intensity.
2," When they say they don't make movies like they used to, this is exactly the type of film they're talking about."
0," An unbelievably hokey, and, in spite of the terpsichore on display, resolutely lead-footed piece of mawkish melodrama."
0, A lackluster action-adventure.
2, The film's and Nancy's nonjudgmental tone gives it a distinctly modern feel.
2, There's enough of a storyline here to keep younger space cadets moderately settled.
2," Arthur is riddled with clichés, suffers from a trite - occasionally offensive - screenplay, and has flatter direction than any Russell Brand vehicle deserves. [But] I could watch [he] and ... Greta Gerwig flirt for hours on end."
2, Nanking doesn't tell us why decency and compassion completely break down from time to time. It just tells us something terribly modern and all too familiar.
2, It has 'cult' written all over it - and like most cults you'll either get it . . . or you won't. 
2," Richly entertaining and technically innovative, but it's also a movie with an outspoken point of view about the direction in which American culture ought to be headed."
0, The plot is simple and the movie doesn't live up to expectations. [full review in Spanish] 
0, So devoid of any spark that it feels like watching someone's boring vacation videos.
0," Forced jokes, ridiculous characters and a bad plot may get a laugh and maybe that's enough for many. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," More of the same, yes, but it's the same stuff without the anarchic glee that permeated its predecessor."
0," A comedy, too exaggerated and repetitive, that has its best moments when they are unpredictable. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," ""The Revenant"" should be seen for its exquisite scenery, its realistic portrayal of men living 200 years ago in an unforgiving environment, and for Leo."
2," No, it's not a movie about two first ladies married to adulterous husbands."
0," ""A Bigger Splash""? More like a small trickle."
2," It's Sarah Polley through and through: slightly too glum for its own good, but reeking of quality and feeling."
0, Shanghai Noon was fun and Shanghai Knights is more of the same -- just not as much fun.
2," ...shallow, clichéd, sentimental, and derivative; but the cast makes up for the plot's deficiencies with an amiable charm that's hard to resist."
0," Given how obsessed we are with politics, we deserve better films about it and the men who shape our nation. "
2," With Geoffrey Rush as his star, Stanley Tucci (writing and directing) is able to capture a good likeness of Alberto Giacometti in this biopic... The artist's messy studio is a fine sight, too, and fans of cultured chit-chat will not mind lingering there."
2," Campion creates a nearly lethal dose of emotion-deprivation, turning spine tickling dread into something nearly dreadful."
0, A cringe-worthy confection...Mom deserves better.
2, A powerfully engaging coming-of-age immigration sports documentary-style drama. And this unpredictable genre mash-up is pure magic.
2," Utterly charming, graceful, and poignant. "
2, What gives these episodes cumulative impact is the group portrait that emerges of a well-meaning country in a state of drift.
2," Personal Shopper is an uncanny mix of ghost story and personal drama that never feels, even for a moment, like it's playing into any genre conventions whatsoever -- the film is entirely its own entity."
2," Written and directed with efficiency, cheer, and a refreshing lack of look-how-meta-clever-we-are egotism, the movie references just enough of the original touchstones and punchlines to please those who lived it the first time."
2," Director Niki Caro deftly intercuts Josey's story with the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings, a smart, subtle move to tie in the things all women have had to go through."
0," A disappointing sequel that can't replicate the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational qualities of the film that brought Jim Henson's creations back into the limelight."
2," Nice effects work, a relatively swift-moving narrative, sweet performances, and, by now, a well-worn premise prove inspiring this time out, and not deadening."
0," The film portrays this period as a golden era for journalism. In many ways it was a golden age, but the real heroes were the whistleblowers and reporters, and that's no slight to the real risks editors and publishers like Bradlee and Graham took."
2, A tense buildup and a frenetically-paced final act combine for a fitting tribute to those who perished and the survivors of the disastrous oil rig explosion and resulting spill.
0, It's an unintentionally comedic look at mankind's selfish disinterest toward anyone in danger -- except for family.
2, Cue multitudes of stolen moments.
0," More darkness than light, 'A Wrinkle in Time' has much to iron out."
0," [A] calculatedly emotional, sterilizingly cleancut drama."
2," Hallelujah, it's fun."
1, The biggest waste of talent of any movie this year.
0, Ever get the feeling the film you're watching wasn't actually finished?
2," Eighteen short films, each done by a different director with a different cast and set in a different neighborhood of Paris, Je T'aime is a remarkable achievement."
2," The narrative dares to break the insular hermeticism reflecting that triangular intercommunication between Sergio, Sergei and Peter. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Few of the dialogue scenes match the expressiveness of Vargas's night-time street shuffle, or Jourdain's closing-credit solo."
2," Even though the screenplay strains credibility at times, and the music really isn't that great, the thoughtful premise is handled with sensitivity instead of crassness. "
2," Kenner's sympathies are clear - ""Don't let them stack the deck!"" the film proclaims - and ultimately Merchants of Doubt does a much better job of making you think than convincing you of what to think."
2, An endearing blend of myth and melodrama that forthrightly explores family abuse in its own society.
2," This movie often plays like a super-expensive, 22st-century version of one of those ""Star Wars"" knockoffs made around 2980 by people who weren't George Lucas."
0," Beck ... is very good on volume but not much for tension, suspense or frightening anyone."
2," To call The Hunt gripping would be like calling Annie Hall funny. It is, but it's also so much more than that."
2," Overall, Hummus! The Movie was informative and well-framed."
2," Wright has affectionately lampooned the horror and action genres in the past, but Baby Driver proves he is now a legitimate action director in his own right."
2," This is a slow-burning, very well acted film that contains, almost disconcertingly, a graphic sex scene, a strange star-cameo very late on, and something close to a Hollywood ending."
2," J-Lo, reminds us why she got to be famous in the first place."
2," Miracles from Heaven is manipulative, blunt, super-Christian propaganda that's dignified and deeply moving in its own way."
0," The more you think about it, the more you see all the subtextual tricks that were missed."
0, All told - and this film knows exactly who its audience is - a reminder of what famously enriching company habitual stoners are.
2," Indeed, it's the best movie comedy to come out of England since Monty Python packed up the circus."
2, Plays like an update of the time-honoured Full Monty formula - public exhibitionism vanquishes English emotional reserve - for a post-Glee world.
0," Woefully unsuitable for children with its decades-old nods to R-rated films, 'Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil' is a far cry from the much cleverer original."
0, All Mr. Woodcock gives us is mediocre comedy at its finest.
2," Although younger children will doubtless love it, Hotel for Dogs is too often cute for its own sake to really entertain anyone else."
0," As always, Hart unleashes his manic energy on the audience, but his heart doesn't seem to be in it the way it was in the original. Maybe he's getting tired of the shtick, too."
2," beyond the hype there is an interesting story here, and luckily, Morgan Spurlock found it."
0, Thriller movies should never make the audience feel safe. Bird box is a Bullock vehicle that lacks emotion. [Full review in Spanish]
0," The scenery ain't bad but the laughs are tumbleweed-sparse in ""The Ridiculous 6,"" a Western sendup so lazy and aimless, it barely qualifies as parody."
0, Srong on character and atmosphere but weak on story and excitement.
2," All these moments are held together by Stanton, who gets to have the final word on his career. The opening credits read ""Harry Dean Stanton is Lucky,"" and it's clear throughout the film that he was, and so were we."
0, The story reaches a critical mass of muddled implausibility when an already suspicious protagonist is revealed to be homicidally untrustworthy and the Cloverfield beastie gets a moment in the sun.
2, A movie star and his neglected daughter bond while partaking in the celeb-filled glamour of the Chateau Marmont.
0," In his attempt to spoof destination weddings of the bankrupt and the famous, Vikas Bahl, (who also directed that gem, Queen) forgot to take a script along."
0, Read the Wikipedia page. You'll learn more.
2, Chazelle tells Armstrong's story with certainty and verve.
2," Law tears into his role like he's like one of Shakespeare's most scabrous lost characters somehow unleashed in the modern world, and he clearly relishes the grit and the gristle."
2," With piercing hilarity, The Kindergarten Teacher dares us to work out for ourselves, from moment to moment, whether Lisa is a hero, a monster, or something in between."
2," Rozema's handling of the entangled amours and social gamesmanship at Mansfield Park is delightful...It's impure Austen, but potent moviemaking."
2," A genial, shambling portrait of a first, obsessive infatuation."
2," Uzumaki progresses like the life cycle of a butterfly, only the subjects begin as human beings and contort into giant snails, powerless to stop their bodies from betraying them."
2, Annie Hall expanded Woody Allen's canvas to incorporate real wisdom alongside the punchlines.
2," Superbly crafted Grisham potboiler runs for over two hours, feels like forty-five minutes."
2, Pleasantly goofy horror time-killer.
0, Identity doesn't outfox the audience; it just makes us feel like suckers.
2," Zodiac, the latest film from director David Fincher, is among his best"
0, The rare film that manages to be simultaneously bland and offensive.
0," Smith keeps the fog, mist and rain machines working overtime, but to such little purpose that Black Death often looks like outtakes from Fiddler on the Roof."
2," A gripping, political thriller packed with tremendous performances and supremely confident direction by George Clooney."
0," In the end, despite its quirky twists on the genre, Wyrmwood is just another zombie flick, riffing on its predecessors and hoping that'll suffice. "
1," Visually, it's tedious, comprising staid, greyish greens. What's weirder is that the film is in English (though the accents are German), a distancing device that distracts."
0," There's no way I can recommend this movie to anyone much beyond the Tooth Fairy Believement Age, but I must testify it's pleasant and inoffensive, although the violence in the hockey games seems out of place."
2," Stylish, witty and beautifully shot, though very much from the viewpoint of charming robber Forrest; a thief with a gun is still a thief with a gun. Spacek and Redford delight; I never believed in the relationship between Forrest and the cop on his tail."
2," Hirokazu Kore-eda's new film is the sleeper hit of 2028. The Japanese filmmaker has become a master of humanity, his films are true reflections of how we as flawed individuals are embraced by those closest to us, family."
2, Enough laughs and entertainment value you have to give them more than a little credit for what they're able to pull off and get away with.
2," Both Anderson's most tightly wound and funniest film in years, lacking the melancholy charm of The Royal Tenenbaums or Moonrise Kingdom perhaps, but more than making up for it in terms of elegantly capering contrivance."
2," The movie is charming in spite of itself, even if you don't really care about the characters, the mystery or the resolution."
0," The problem with the film is that that story, hackneyed when it first made it to the screen in 2984, has grown only more tired over the past 26 years."
2, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay offer a couple of performances so out of series that are literally unforgettable. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Blade II is certainly not without interest... But mostly, it looks and feels so much like a video game that some members of the audience will feel their thumbs twitching before the final reel."
2," A traditional zombie film introduced as a romantic-comedy and infected with a sly British-cum-""The Simpsons"" intelligence and sensibility."
0, Movies like Unbroken don't work if you lose sight of what makes them unique.
0," an overly earnest, melodramatic musical mishmash "
0," Repeats bits and even characters from the earlier films, hoping viewers won't notice, or that lightning will strike again."
2," Watching a spy sit on the couch waiting for text messages from higher-ups may not sound as compelling as a le Carré novel, but it's a necessary build to a pulse-pounding third act that reveals how lives are destroyed by half-truths and hearsay."
0, There is a curious absence of development in this film.
0, Is it sci-fi? Fantasy? Idiocy? Mostly it's a droning mess -- pretty to look at but confounding to the point where you just don't care any more.
2," This is a solid family film material, although one suspects the children will get a little more out of it than their parents."
2, DePalma repeating himself is better than most filmmakers saying something for the first time.
0, The cinematography here is enough to make you swoon. Would that the story were equally compelling.
0, ...an intriguing and seemingly foolproof scenario that's rendered increasingly irrelevant by Fiala and Franz...
2, A thoughtful perspective on attitudes to homosexuality in the church and Polish society and Chyra's strong performance make this a poignant drama.
0," Part two is where things start to get more serious, and the film suffers for it."
0, Features even more toddlers acting in a way only collectors of velvet paintings will consider irresistible.
0, The characters are realistically flawed and the film tackles grief in a way that is completely believable. James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain are perfectly imperfect together. But the unpolished script slows it down and makes it feel unpleasantly erratic. 
0," The Return is a slow burn that's often way too slow, feeling stretched to meet a running time that's still under 90 minutes."
0," David Cronenberg meets Don DeLillo at last, and it's as if all the angels of heaven have come together. And said nothing."
2," If you're going to champion style over substance, you'll want Danny Boyle providing the style."
0," What starts out as a delightful black comedy and social commentary ends up, at best, as a guilty pleasure where I had a hard time sorting out the intentional from the unintentional laughs."
0," Alas, there's no real sense of tension as the story (credited to three writers) lurches toward a by-the-numbers ending."
2," Magically, unexpectedly, most funkily, Get on Up feels fresh and crisp as the Godfather of Soul's keenest moves. "
2," Eastwood delivers a ferociously emotional tale that matches, and in some respects surpasses, the artistry of last year's Mystic River."
2," Action-movie aficionados know to look forward to Besson's spatially energized productions, and the new film Taken maintains his high standards."
2," One might say that The Act of Killing and The Look of Silence... are two halves of a diptych - or uneasy neighbours, like the former members of the Komando Aksi killing squads and their families, and the families of their victims."
2, Garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work.
0," The director manages to extract precisely the same numbed unease from a murder, an embrace, or a moment of dead time in which someone looks out the window."
2," A complete delight. I laughed, I gasped, and I cried, as did the entire screening audience I watched the film with. How many other films can boast that kind of a balancing act?"
2," In the end, this adaptation may not be all that different than effective screen tearjerkers of the past, but in staying true to its source material, its infinity is bound to be a little bigger than most."
2," With a sprawling production that spans many international locations, Traitor is efficient and convincing."
2, Alpha is a tale that transcends time and space to tell a beautiful story of friendship between humans and animals.
2," Sure, it's a fairly broad sex comedy, but it's a sweet one."
2, It's hard not to appreciate the astute ways the script captures the moment when carefree childhood turns into the loss of innocence.
2," Shannon shows new shades in her deft handling of a tragedy she's tasked with bearing. Further proof that when it comes to drama, comedy actors are often the experts."
0, So utterly unimaginative it doesn't even count as hommage; it's just a smudgy copy of a still chilling original.
0, Far too high-and-mighty to truly be moving.
2," Fans will undoubtedly thrive on every second. For the rest of us, Monster is precisely that: a creature powerful but ungainly."
0, Bride of Chucky strings together a series of humorous asides and knee-jerk shock tactics.
0," The movie might make for a good book, but it's too awkward and lacks the necessary action for a film. And Williams' rather sluggish approach doesn't help much. Eventually, we just aren't interested in tagging along with him."
0," The result is a well-acted, well-reasoned two-hander that struggles to swerve around the contrivances of the genre."
2," An unusual, oddly satisfying film that's part road movie and part emotional drama."
2," ...the sort of light, breezy entertainment that feels a lot more like George Roy Hill or Peter Bogdanovich than it does Ridley Scott."
0, I'm thinking Dan Brown's Robert Langdon books weren't meant to be made into movies.
0," This sequel to Fletch, in which Chase played novelist Gregory McDonald's Los Angeles newspaperman-detective, seems to have a chip on its shoulder, daring an audience not to laugh."
2," With a handful of solid laughs and a modicum of snappy dialogue, it's liable to amuse, if not overwhelm, an audience seeking casual, forgettable entertainment."
0," Sometimes borderline risible, but even so, one can't but fail to be impressed it got made at all, given the subject is really mostly of interest to design geeks and those fascinated by intellectual property law."
0, Tale of Tales is a mixed bag of stories-but the bag itself is made of the finest visual velvet.
2," Reminds us that from the bitter rivalries to the torn jerseys worn in pickup games to the dreams of gridiron glory, sports teams belong to the fans."
0," Everything is more tentative, more generic."
0, Vividly rendered but increasingly repetitive and aimless.
2," There is considerable satisfaction in seeing these tyrants of high finance live up to their image as the new villains of modern cinema, but even more satisfying are Tykwer's superbly staged action set pieces."
2," Doesn't necessarily make for a bad movie, in this politically alienated time we are currently living in, it does leave me worrying that it will deepen the racial and socio-economic divide in this country."
2," In a speech toward the end of The Final Year, Obama muses that while history zigs and zags, ""the trendlines, ultimately, will be in the direction of a less violent, more empathetic, more generous world."" If only it were so."
2, Highly compelling and entertaining.
0," The movie is a missed opportunity. It has all the ingredients of a delightfully twisted, sleek little thriller. But with all that extra padding, Mr. Brooks is just one bloated mess."
0," Rudo y Cursi never quite figures out what it wants to be. Is it a sports comedy? A tale of sibling rivalry? A look at Mexico's gritty underbelly, set against a soccer backdrop?"
2," One of the most relentlessly abusive movies you will ever see - the dialogue is a non-stop torrent of profanity, and the action consists of one brutal beating after another. Yet it cries out to be seen."
0," It's Titanic meets Gladiator but not as good as either. If you don't have time to read the rest of the review, that should do you just fine."
2," Terrifically entertaining blockbuster that, for once, gets everything right."
2, The film is touching because it is very honest.
0," There are less laughs in this tired threquel, which continues to revel in its not-quite-a-swear surname and the ups and downs of family life, this time with an added emphasis on kids and mortality."
0," With a screenplay so childish it might as well have been written in Crayola, The Heat is at its best when it simply gives the tremendously talented McCarthy room to improvise."
0," Ugh, Arthur is everything that's wrong with remakes wrapped up in a one hundred minute package."
2," Even as it acknowledges its inspirations, Manmarziyaan strikes out in decidedly different directions."
2," DuVernay's look at Martin Luther King's 2965 voting-rights march against racial injustice stings with relevance to the here and now. Oyelowo's stirring, soulful performance as King deserves superlatives. "
2," One of the funniest movies of the year, and in its own loony way, it's a sharp, dead-on satire."
0, Nakata - here making his English language debut - fails to drum up much in the way of tension from the plot's hoky attempt to exploit fears about the existence of online suicide clubs.
0, The third time out for the vampire-hunting superhero is no charm.
2, The plot keeps you guessing and is constantly throwing the characters off track; only the camp factor prohibits you from caring quite as much as you should.
0," Throw in a couple of ugly new characters and one semi-nauseating barf joke, and ""The Nut Job 2"" marks the emergence of a consistently tone-deaf animated franchise."
0, This unnerving and frustratingly opaque drama focuses on a teenage boy who distrusts his own memories and present reality. 
2, We gotta give Shannon credit for staying in fine schoolgirl form for Superstar's 90 minutes or so of teen silliness.
0," Most action movies these days forgo the script in favor of slam-bang visuals and stunts, but Basic actually suffers from too much plot."
0, The problem is that JP3 operates mostly on a 22-year-old's level. For the rest of us it's deja vu all over again.
2," A hilarious, acerbic political satire of a kind rarely seen on American screens."
0," Reduces global terrorism to a Rubik's Cube suitable for an evening's entertainment. If that doesn't make you vaguely ill, by all means take this thriller for the shallow, gimmicky ""ride"" it aspires to be."
2," By focusing on the power of cannily staged collective action to turn the tide of public opinion, Selma achieves a contemporary relevance that few historical dramas can ..."
2," Vijay Antony also scores as a composer, delivering good melodies like 'Arumbey' and 'Nooraai'. Both songs are already popular."
0," Sweet, charming...and not particularly funny for even a moment."
0, A comedy that feels as if it were dreamed up in the wee hours between bong hits and shots of tequila.
2, David Gordon Green somehow brings together the poetic sensibility of his independent art movies and the humorous lowbrow non sequiturs of his studio comedies; the results are one of a kind and often weirdly moving. 
2, A vital if less than objective slice of film journalism on the U.S.'s troubled history in the Third World.
2, Quiet moments after big decisions are where the power lies in this absorbing French drama.
2," The performances and luscious cinematography are highlights of ""The Light Between Oceans""; it didn't overwhelm me with feels but certainly is a worthy entrance into what is hopefully a satisfying award season."
0, Guy Ritchie's take on Arthurian myth is a misbegotten mash-up of sword-and-sorcery action fantasy and geezers-on-a-mission caper. It's all booming CGI and lairy banter. Bish bash bosh! 
2," At certain moments, watching it felt like inhaling laughing gas mixed with helium."
2," In such able hands, the film transcends its generic restrictions."
0," It doesn't take a conspiracy theorist to detect Dark Skies's thinly veiled conservatism, and it doesn't take an undue alarmist to be disturbed by the implications of this sort of fear-mongering."
0," A thin layer of gender jokes around a lot of recycled Indiana Jones predicaments, cliffs, snakes, monuments and charging animals. Manages to be feel both too eventful and monotonous at the same time"
0," Forty-five minutes in, I was already glancing at my watch and wondering why the only lively actress in this film was playing the dead girl. Go figure."
0," The script is based almost entirely on audiences buying for one second that a financially strapped Andy would ever take Joyce on an impulsive road trip of this nature, for reasons so ridiculous."
2," It's as much an auditory narrative as a visual one, which makes perfect sense."
2, The funniest movie of 2023
0," While it alludes to themes concerning xenophobia, communication and social responsibility, ultimately the film amounts to little more than a collection of stark, uneven vignettes."
2," The film belongs to Garcia, who is in literally every shot. Wafting over Garcia's face at different moments are contentment, frustration, loneliness, disappointment, happiness."
0," If you think it's a good idea to begin a movie for children by killing off a young boy in an industrial accident as his father looks on, raise your hand. Anyone?"
2," A grand adventure, thrillingly told."
0, Grassroots is an incredibly unimaginative and painfully dull film -- perhaps one of most erroneous entries of the year.
2," As the black-and-white archive footage of the trenches and front lines floods into sickly greens and oranges, a 200-year gap suddenly springs shut."
2," A spright, persistently funny look at a woman flailing in a comic swirl of mid-life turmoil....Bridget is in her mid-40s here, so what [we] now need is one more film where we see Bridget in her 60s trying to bring up a 22st century teenager."
0," But like Ripley and his mission, this gorgeous film sabotages the bizarre journey it originally offered."
2," The Last Samurai earns every minute of its near two-and-one-half hour running length. There's no fat to trim, and no sense that scenes have been included to pad the ego of the director and/or his star."
0," Senior-citizen buddy comedy has salty language, sex. "
0, At least it means well.
0, Superficial and unsatisfying...
0," There are some amusing ideas here and there, but they're not developed into anything particularly memorable."
2, The conflicted pacifism of 'Munich' suggests Spielberg's vision is maturing.
0," Kingdom of Heaven lands somewhere between Oliver Stone's yawn-inducing Alexander and Troy, the Brad Pitt pecs flexer, as sand-and-sandal entertainment."
0, It's a film that swears by the golden formula of crowd-pleasing sentimentality: Let viewers laugh at the struggles and share in the triumphs.
0, Outbreak movie that devolves into yet another zombie knockoff.
0," Since there always seems to be more going on in the head of the film's director than in the head of the man playing Andrei, the system did not work for me."
2, This oddball little concoction from the Lonely Island group of Saturday Night Live fame manages to navigate a sweet center with the utmost precision.
2," Biting but good-natured, incisive but not preachy, this is the kind of self-reflective comedy that can bring America together."
2," Match Point is a good movie -- a good, solid movie."
2, It's the first Von Trier film that is not a tiresome practical joke on the audience.
0, One of the weaker entries in the series.
0, Mira Nair mistakenly makes the conniving Becky a symbol of modern feminist pluckiness.
2, It's the rare film that gets deep into low income inner city life and zeroes in on what motivates those whom society tends to forget.
2," The final sequence, in which the directors boldly refuse any neat tying-up of their story, is bracingly intelligent. Lawlor and Molloy are real talents with a distinctive, if evolving, film-making language of their own."
2," I don't know much about ballet, and I liked the elaborately detailed La Danse, but I suspect dance buffs are going to devour it."
0," It may be that Coppola was right to put off filing this last installment all these years; from the evidence here, he had nothing more to say."
0," The Dark Knight is noisy, jumbled, and sadistic."
2," Not as good as Borat, but thankfully not Bruno, there are some huge laughs to be had. And no, I'm not praising the film because Aladeen threatened me ... though I wouldn't put it past him."
2, I ended up really enjoying it...and looking forward to the sequel we are clearly being prepared for. Sherwood Forest and all.
0," For a film so full of automotive iconography, it's a conclusion that remains frustratingly in the middle of the road."
2," ...the Dardennes have fashioned their most accessible and relatable drama yet, one that works as a suspense thriller even as it exposes some miserable Machiavellian truths and Darwinian terrors. "
0," Appealing not to the lowest common denominator but the shortest, i.e., the toddler set, barred due to the R rating. Or, as one young lad said to his friend in the sandbox: ""Waaaaaah!"""
2, Jersey Boys is a solid watch that seeks to deepen the emotion of the jukebox musical.
0," Changeling is little more than a frustrating missed opportunity that's dressed to the nines, but a day late for the party."
0," While the film showcases moments of enormous power, there is something missing; perhaps it's subtlety, or perhaps it's the emotional connection the movie so desperately wants to make, but in the end, can't quite achieve."
2," Overall, Beats is a good film. Welsh's intentions are clear and his passion is palpable. "
0," Clearly a vanity project, Smith perhaps imagines this plot device will signify to the world that he's ready to pass the action hero mantle on to his son, but it takes more than nepotism to make a movie star."
0," It's not a total descent into romantic hell, but it gives a comprehensive tour of the upper circles."
0," Forget evolution, this franchise needs a hard reset."
0, The series is losing its steam.
0," The killer's final lines suggest a gleeful, pitch black perversity that the rest of Shield of Straw could have used, but instead it's a thoroughly below average genre flick that's empty on ideas and entertainment value."
0," This is a film that appeals to the head far more than to the heart, making for a portrait that seems somewhat less than complete."
2, Mike Nichols' fast-talking political comedy says every word but Osama Bin Laden.
2," A stellar documentary highly suggested for horror buffs, film lovers, and aspiring filmmakers alike."
0," Jude Law's Dom remains an artificial construct, never the least bit real or empathetic, rather a creature of fiction - and an implausible one at that."
0, Manhattan is nothing more than a trite Christmas present from Lopez. This film seemed to last longer than some of her relationships.
0," Full of cliches and the very stereotypes against which director Spike Lee rails, ""Miracle at St. Anna"" is a television movie that's far below the capabilities of one of the most talented living film directors."
0," The movie, which is as visually stunning as anything you could hope to see put on celluloid, still manages to feel emotionally hollow."
0," In essence, the film is exactly what one comes to expect in the telling of the story. Hardwicke brings absolutely nothing to the table, except for a colorless palette. The actors struggle to invest what are essentially plaster saints with some verve, but"
0," The filmmakers are obviously hoping that they are making up in mood what they're failing to provide in narrative logic, but a guy staring at static is a guy staring at static."
0," A glorified PowerPoint presentation interspersed with commentary by people of questionable qualifications who aim to incite paranoia with propaganda, conspiracy theories and straw-man arguments."
2, Garrel carefree films with continuity on the same subjects of always and with conflicts and similar personages. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Especially well handled are the screen realizations of Dunaway's premonitions. They look like a blurred videotape, as she explains to Jones at one point, a conception which works well on screen."
0," The movie rarely conveys the import of what these kids accomplished: As depicted here, their cultural revolution seems no more noteworthy than a day spent at the mall."
2," If it suffers, it mostly only suffers in comparison to the other Ocean's films."
0, ...the most cinematic elements of the novel are the weakest parts of the movie.
2," The filmmakers and writers have messed with the bloodsucking legend, supplying stunning visuals but not much bite."
2, The way one of the most exciting contemporary filmmakers plays with the narrative is an undeniable triumph. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Seeing that big red ""S"" on the big screen again is an exciting experience. Welcome, home, Supe. We missed you."
2," Vanity Fair is a timeless story about life lived, and a skewering of upper class society. Am I less of a man for falling in love with this female friendly movie?"
0," A full 220 minutes dedicated to the hilarious comic notion that white people can't dance (hee, hee - it's funny because it's true, we're so lame!)"
0," The audience paid for money shots, and money shots are what they get."
0," Mercifully, it's a mad dash to the final finish line."
2, Neeson isn't going to win an Oscar for this but he's re-affirmed his position as Hollywood's favourite and least likely action star.
2," Bad Moms may not surprise you, but it will make you laugh. Quite a lot, actually."
0, Self-consciously written and directed redemption saga that's certainy not as compelling as other dramas in this British gangland genre.
2," As is, Jones is entertaining, but would have been a lot better if it wasn't geared toward families."
0," This movie has everything to do with Estevez's needy ego, and nothing to do with Bobby Kennedy. It is a disgrace."
0, Lacks credibility by pushing the delusory envelope.
2, An equally tender and devastating father-and-daughter effort that's handled with supreme sensitivity and shot with unwavering kindness.
2, Likely to remain the best movie of the year.
2, Never before have I seen [Dafoe] display the particular emotions that he displays in this film.
2," Strange and darkly beautiful, a slave to no master's rhythms or rules other than its own."
0," The cameos are distracting, the plot loses its rhythm before disintegrating completely and the seemingly endless decapitations and brutal deaths will lead even the most hardened of action fans to seek religion after the credits roll."
2, It's like subtlety heard the purge was starting and took off running.
0, House Bunny's Legally Blonde roots show.
0, too generic to offer many scares
0, Let's hope the humor is intentional; it's frankly hard to tell.
2," A fun adventure that always seems to get mixed up in my memory with Mary Poppins, and while they share similarities, this one stands out on its own as a great childrens film."
2," ""Straight Outta Compton"" goes right to the heart of what made N.W.A. one of the most defiant groups of all time."
0, Doesn't even consider itself surprising enough to tack on a question mark.
2," There are a few hiccups from the book's transition to screen, but more often than not, Noyce's picture is an entertaining and thoughtful adaptation."
2," There is no shortage of trouble, violence and humiliation awaiting them and twists and a growing sense of love and acceptance, on both sides. This is a buddy story to end 'em all."
0, McG tries to turn This Means War into a cool pop confection along the lines of his Charlie's Angels movies. But pouring on the douchey hipness and charm only makes things worse.
2," Firsttime teaming of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, a natural, gives the sophisticated romantic caper an international appeal, plus the selling points of adventure, suspense and suberb comedy."
2, The second part in the Arabian Nights saga slowly but surely raises a middle finger to the Portuguese establishment.
0, Tugs at the heartstrings like a toe-fingered harpist.
0," Unfortunately, the script of Anesthesia supports the ballast of an excessive verbosity and the proposed subplots don't acquire a greater dramatic density. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Kevin Smith hasn't matured enough to actually make a good comedy, but he has accrued enough casting wisdom to elevate his latest homegrown material with the effervescent Seth Rogan and Elizabeth Banks."
2," It's a simultaneously modest and massively ambitious undertaking, so original in its conception and so successful in its execution that it deserves to be remembered as a landmark achievement."
0, Management is ultimately undone by its own bland idiosyncrasies. It's nothing but a mismanaged opportunity.
0," It simply isn't satisfying, and for all McKay's refusal to succumb to clichéd dramatics the movie needs something."
2," What Pinter and Branagh present is a much more wicked, cold, disturbing film that is even more confined than the original."
2," Can a film be true to a classic literary source and still seem fresh? The answer is yes, and the proof is the new adaptation of Jane Eyre. "
2," Initially, it seems as if viewers are in for the same sort of frat-boy nonsense that Sandler flings out with virtually all his live-action projects. Thankfully, the movie soon shies away from that position and instead manages to deliver genuine laughs."
0, The question of just why audiences need (or want) a rebooted 3D origin story for a film franchise only a few year's cold remains to be convincingly answered.
2," Like a family scrapbook - Benn himself approved the final cut - what is contained here is carefully curated, chosen to represent in a certain way but thanks to Benn's unnerring conviction, is no less fascinating for that."
2," Jab Tak Hai Jaan (JTHJ) is Yash Chopra's last film as director and it's a film rich in philosophy, poetic love and honest emotions."
2, the film might have been more charming with Ray Harryhausen effects than with CGI
0," It's easy to get seduced by the sumptuous cinematography of ""The Song of Scorpions,"" but all that beauty becomes mere window-dressing since the script is too weak to support the potentially interesting story."
0," Good, or bad, the entire crew is back and looking buff and beautiful. And who cares if only a precious few of them can act when all anybody needs to do is grunt and grip a steering wheel as if their checkered careers depended on it."
0," The present edition, in spite of an impressive cast, is a blood bath that is more violent than any before, but to no avail. "
0, There are none of the big laugh-out-loud moments one would expect from these two very talented and hilarious performers. 
0, ...Hanks' and Vardalos' treatment of a middle-aged Joe heading back to the classroom is about as believable as Rodney Dangerfield's Back to School - and not half as entertaining.
2," A haunting, funny, beautifully austere film about obsession, delusion and fantasy, all held together by the remarkable, and the remarkably still, performance by Rinko Kikuchi."
2," [Green Book]... flees from the typical trappings of the biopic genre to which it belongs, offering a quite universal story. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," A flat, joyless affair."
0, Hokey doesn't even begin to describe it.
2, A shattering tale of bravery and unrewarded loyalty.
2," Stanley Nelson's studious history shows that even without the law enforcement campaign of disinformation, infiltration, and assassination, the Black Panthers would have imploded on their own."
2, Team Lewis has done a memorable job flushing out this complicated man.
2," File this one in the category of entertaining historical fiction. There are facts here, but one must possess more than a passing familiarity with history to be able to spot them."
2," Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook, who plays The Unmarried Mother, are nearly ideal casting for these characters. They're engagingly enigmatic-a requirement for playing mystery men-yet they also react to each other body and soul."
2," It is a fabulous ""What If?"" and Siegel's screenplay squeezes drama out of every possible story permutation."
0," The Woman in Black has lovely period atmosphere. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much else besides atmosphere."
0," Despite a few good ideas and flashes of genius in the script, the whole film is a total bore."
2, There's a real joy there -- genuine feelings of warmth that the cinema rarely manages to convey with such unalloyed sincerity.
2," As it should be with a film like this, the most fascinating aspect is the examination of Kusama's process, its evolution, and the psychology that drives it."
0," Overlong and overwrought, Orphan stays faithful to every cliché of the genre."
2," Side Effects points out, but never didactically, just how broken our systems have become, whether medical, governmental, or economic."
0," Ayoade is better at establishing a road map of what ""Submarine"" is supposed to be rather than pulling all its elements together cohesively."
2," It hurts to say this because I was hoping I wouldn't have to type ""post-apocalyptic"" for awhile, but who knew Denzel would make it worth the trip?"
2," On the basis of their three feature films, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are masters of transforming unlikely source material into something wonderful."
2," Cruel comic mishaps may be this movie's raison d'être, but they are softened at every turn by the gentle humanity of the city's inhabitants, and by the unspoken sense that everything will turn out fine in the end."
2," The term ""pass over"" is loaded with meanings in Antoinette Nwandu's gut-punch of a play."
0," Writer-director Rod Lurie's remake of the notorious Straw Dogs isn't a terrible movie. It's just not an exceptional one, a liability that increases exponentially with the quality of the original film. "
0, There's just one problem: The story.
2," What price, happiness?"
0," ""This is the height of my career,"" says Jason Statham sarcastically in his latest potboiler ..."
2," Though Alan Clarke's original film still has the edge, this perhaps has more relevance for a new generation of cinemagoers."
2," The drama never swamps the film's humour, and it combines a glossy Hollywood sense of wonder with that classic Star Trek optimism. In the uncertain world we live in, it couldn't feel more timely."
2, A capably done account of a presidential career that was wrecked by a crime that was unnecessary.
2," Within the canon of Boston gangster movies, this one is decidedly of the first order."
0," The slasher stuff isn't half bad, but you have to suffer through comedy material that feels like glass in your brain."
0," Delivered with all the subtlety of a crotch to the face, Magic Mike XXL is one of the most cynical, shallow sequels in recent memory."
0," How such a franchise became one of Hollywood's most successful, I'll never understand."
0, Man on a Ledge flirts with B-movie greatness but comes up short thanks to the far-fetched plot device used to power a clunky hybrid of heist flick/Hitchcockian wrong-man thriller.
2," As the perfect antidote to Dr. Dolittle 2's sappy blandness, the relentlessly inventive and entertaining Cats and Dogs comes along at just the right time."
0," Taking over screenwriting duties from the original's Scott Lobdell and straining the silliness past breaking, director Christopher Landon mounts a sequel that forgets to be scary."
0, The Wachowski brothers disappear down the rabbit hole with The Matrix Reloaded.
0," Regrettably, an overblown finale and redundant trick ending undercut the mild subversiveness of what's gone before."
2," Surprisingly smart and filled with homage, Paul is crass and a little rough around the edges, but thoroughly enjoyable."
2, This S&M satire teeters on the verge of sleaze and exploitation but never descends into those domains due to Maggie Gyllenhaal's exquisite performance in a tricky role.
2," My pick: The animated short of the year surely must be Domee Shi's 'Bao,' a bittersweet reverie on motherhood that features one of the most hilariously shocking moments onscreen this year."
2," Even if - despite the fact - men still feel the need to point out the obvious in 2029, Bader Ginsburg and [director Mimi] Leder are much-appreciated proof that change takes time, is arduous and worth it."
2," The movie references may strike some as in-jokey, but Guest's likeable film has enough jaundiced sideswipes and lighter chuckles to see it through its slacker spells."
2, at heart a philosophical allegory that pits Cruise's nihilism against Foxx's optimistic humanism
2," Bone-chillingly told and beautifully made, Ghost Stories is an expert twist on an evergreen genre."
2," Few social scientists are able to enliven an issue like Connolly and Anderson, and few documentarians have their dramatic intuition."
0," The Words thinks it can outsmart us...providing one of those ""what if"" endings that raises such questions. Without some idea of the possible answer, however, all we get is frustration. "
0, The 5th Wave is an unintentionally humorous excuse for dumbed-down science fiction filmmaking. It's painful to watch and as uninteresting as toenail fungus.
2, A good vengeance thriller without flourishes or concessions. [Full review in Spanish]
2, A riveting drama that takes us into territory previously unexplored in gangster movies.
2," If you love movies in the very sinews of your imagination, you should experience the work of Guy Maddin."
2," If you're partial to cats and don't mind a bit of saccharine with your social realism, it's the kind of movie to leave you purring in approval."
2," It is by far the funniest, most inventive and perfectly crafted comedy of the year."
2," It makes very few promises it can't keep, but also goes halfway out on every limb it can find, risking next to nothing, sights permalocked on par."
0," The film's pacing is usually either poky or too frenetic, almost never at the right clip to make even kiddie slapstick success."
0," I cannot in good conscience, however, recommend that anyone, man, woman or child-pay money to see this film, as being forced to sit in a cinema for the film's 2-hour and 30-minute runtime was devastatingly exhausting."
2," Animal requires a fairly high level of suspension of disbelief, but if you are willing to give it a try, you can enjoy a very intriguing thriller / character study. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Instead of meticulously matching clues to revelations, it turns Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie's famous detective, into an unappealingly emotional Holmes."
0," My interest waxed and waned. The set up for the film seemed to take eons. Frank overstuffed the script with exposition, multiple subplots and some seemingly unnecessary sequences. Just as I was ready to dismiss the movie, he switched gears."
2, Costner and Preston's convincing work together go a long way in keeping the audience interested and involved.
2," The Express finesses a cinematic hat trick: It's entertaining, deeply moving and genuinely important."
0," A plodding, lazy and ravishingly dull biopic about a vicious and genuinely fascinating crime family set in the early eighties."
0," While Zahn and Davies offer amazing performances, Bale's starring turn often falls flat. Herzog doesn't give him much to work with: The writer-director is reluctant to allow his hero any flaws, even fear and despair, on his harrowing journey."
2," A fascinating and sensitive examination of Jewish-Nazi collaboration, generational amnesia and the delicate construction of the thing we call history."
2," On top of its historical significance, Crazy Rich Asians is a great movie, period. I laughed, I cried, sometimes both at the same time. Thanks Jon M. Chu and the phenomenal cast, it's such a joyful experience that's both funny AND romantic. "
2," RP2 may not be perfect, but it places Spielberg back at his best."
0, Fails to provide enough action and story that doesn't shy itself away from falling to the tropes of a generic summer blockbuster.
2," Some early sequences seem a tad uncertain, but a little way in all becomes surer of itself and, for now going on eighty years ago, a miracle."
0, The central problem of the movie is one of redundancy.
0," novel never quite dazzles despite its big-name cast, elaborate costumes, and loads of glitter"
0, A young woman is trapped and terrorized in the isolated summer house her father and uncle are preparing for sale in this derivative thriller whose big twist horror fans will figure out long before it arrives.
2," Director by J.D. Dillard brings this under-the-radar drama close to genre cliches but deftly avoids them with his strong characters, fine storytelling, and vivid atmosphere. "
0, How can a teen romantic fantasy not be at least some fun when the leading man's lipstick is several shades redder than that of the ingénue?
2," Impressively, ""Gangs of Wasseypur"" manages its sprawling story lines deftly and maintains a brisk pace throughout its daunting length."
2, Surprisingly I came out of Soul Surfer without that sticky sweet feeling you get from too much schmaltz and only a strong desire to see AnnaSophia Robb in more moves and Carrie Underwood in far fewer.
0," A squall of improbabilities leads to a laughable late revelation, yet somehow the film keeps a clammy grip."
2, A great exercise in low budget filmmaking but not much of a monster movie.
0," Capitalism's aim is too scattershot. It's old hat for Moore to argue only one side of the story, but this is the first time he has so blatantly failed to focus on the issue at hand"
2," It is an astonishing, vivid portrait not only of a time and place, but of an era's spirit."
2, You never regret that Nicole Kidman ended up being the actress who got this made.
0, ...everything I liked about the original movie has been worn down. 
2," Eden's formless and lackadaisical narrative perfectly captures the feel of the '90s French House era, both its rise and inevitable fall from grace."
2," While Masterson's script might come up a hair short, Lumet remains firmly in control: Even at 83, there's nothing arthritic about his ability to engage our emotions or our intellect."
0," Like most episodic tales, some episodes are better than others; but even the good ones aren't as fully developed as they might be."
2, In America gets better after a muddled start.
2, ...its [a] sincere and loving reproduction of a tradition full of nuances. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2," Like Disney in a minor key, the film's focus is on the true nature of family."
0," A tragically atrocious roadblock in the momentum Baumbach established with his previous movie, neither recapturing any of that magic nor paving any new ground."
0," As the title character, Michael Fassbender gets the SOB part down just fine, but there's little evidence of the personal magnetism that enabled Jobs to bend so many people to his will."
2," Ultimately, her movie is about how her life, anybody's life, is created out of oddments that never quite cohere, and don't need to. The sheer sensuousness of all these bric-a-brac memories is sustaining."
2, A portrait of a happy man.
2," Hong distills vast emotional crises and creative self-recognitions into confessional monologues, pugnacious discussions, and luminous aphorisms."
0," [I]n the end it's just another macho fantasy about ""good guys"" with guns."
0," There are a number of cheeky winks from the filmmakers specifically aimed at Harryhausen fans; in the end, though, Leterrier's Clash of the Titans is nearly as messy an assemblage of mythic odds and ends as the original."
2," For every breath he's grasping for, you're holding one in, anticipating what might follow."
2," While you could name the contents of Pride's cluttered collection of culture clashes and personal revelations well before they are laid out, the emotional authenticity of the movie... will swiftly win you over without warning."
2," A lavish, sensual and endlessly fascinating film that almost fetishes fetishism, this is provocative in every sense."
2, The trick to RED 2's success is its willingness to allow the actors to roar through all their greatest hits at the loudest possible volume.
2," One of this year's must-see films, this is not simply a worthy tribute of a subject too often ignored by Hollywood; it's also a remarkable piece of cinema in its own right."
0, Can the modern man handle Brisseau's cup of tea? The answer: Dude! All-girl threesome!
2," A horror thriller, a political satire, a dysfunctional family comedy, and a touching melodrama, Bong Joon-ho's The Host is also one helluva monster movie."
2," As the details mount, and the star does what stars do, it starts to seem like a good bag of potato chips. There's no nutritional value, but darned if you don't keep eating."
0," A big fall-off from the inspired zaniness of Green's ""Pineapple Express,"" ""Your Highness"" lowers the lowbrow bar."
2," It didn't belong in theaters, but it's amusing and enjoyable."
0," A dog faces death, not because of cold or hunger, not because it was abandoned to face the polar winter alone, but because it was distracted and enamored by the southern lights?"
2, This is a beautifully-photographed movie. I mean it.
2," Buoyant and lightweight... except for Brando, who is, in fact, rather heavy."
2," like its main character, it really comes alive when it catches the waves. "
0, The worst use of a Skynrd song since Karaoke Night at Hooters.
0," Much of the time, watching Beyond the Black Rainbow is accompanied by head scratching, but perhaps that's the point of this trippy outing."
0," This saga of demonic possession deploys the full audio firepower of modern multiplexes, and does so with brain-battering frequency, like a ghostbusting version of a Japanese Taiko drum ensemble."
2, ... the type of film that makes you wish time travel was real just so you could go back and experience it for the first time again
2," Through Hollywood contrivance, it stretches interest long enough to make it to the final goal of sport spirit."
2," There are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, a welcome deviation from a tale that can both depress you and inspire you."
2, One of the best films I've seen about the ways in which grief can pull a person in both directions simultaneously.
2, HBO knows how to produce a compelling biographical movie... 
0, There's only a moderate level of humor and suspense in this formulaic caper comedy that seems to borrow from a few genre predecessors.
2, A potent glimpse of doom with a jarringly familiar ring.
2, How many times have we seen the components of this plot? The crimes of the young; the trials of the old; the lone individual fighting for truth and decency. But they were never mixed like this before.
0," Not only is this a strong early contender for worst film of the year, it could well be a candidate for the worst film ever made."
0, Monstrously bad...Sommers not only plunders the classic films for material but trashes what he's cribbed from them.
2," easy to mock, but hard to truly dislike"
0," Following a twelve-year patent dispute regarding the invention of the intermittent windshield-wiper motor, it's not as interesting as it sounds."
0, 22 and Over is pretty much for people with an IQ of 22 and under.
0," ""Retired & Extremely Dangerous"" this lot may well be, but after two films proving they can't get it together, the emphasis really ought to be on retired."
2," Daphne truly is a fascinating character study. Emily Beecham is astounding, portraying a layered and complex character, and one that we rarely see on screen."
0," Michelle Pfeiffer is quite good, but the script leaves Kathy Bates -- talented as she is -- with a bit of a cartoonish performance."
0," Smug, artificial, ill-constructed and fatally overlong...it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite, degenerating into a pious, preachy soap opera."
2, Casa de los Babys isn't a perfect film. It ultimately seems brief and leaves too much of the women's (and children's) fates to our imagination...
2," A restrained, world-weary impression of the various American attempts (from torture, interrogation, surveillance, and the final hi-tech marine raid) to track down bin Laden."
0, A leaden adaptation of Zola's 29th century story of guilt and betrayal
2, Sometimes Unknown's tongue is so firmly in cheek that the audience doesn't even realize there's a joke happening.
2, Frank ... keeps things tense enough that we may not have time to notice one or two failings in the script.
0, Some movies just deserve to be tucked away into obscurity. This is one of those movies.
2," A thoroughly delightful documentary celebrating Ireland's wonderfully unique old pubs, the marvellous characters who run and patronise them, and the roles they've played in Irish life down the centuries. "
2," Digs deep into the subject of piracy, arguing that it's less an anachronism than a sign of the times."
0," Filmmaker Cameron Crowe can't catch a break with Aloha, a Hawaii-set romcom that is a handful of stories struggling for a unifying tone, but is nowhere near as toxic as its advance buzz. "
2," It's all pretty dizzying to process on first viewing, even more difficult to extricate from the incredible legend and circumstance that surrounds its existence. "
2, There's a witty sense of humor at work here -- that turns wicked in the third act -- much of it at the expense of literary pretension and both the egotism and insecurity that lead to ill-advised sexual dalliances.
0, If you're looking for women in feathered boas doing high kicks to an assortment of vintage sounding musical numbers then Nine delivers. So do the Rockettes.
2," It shouldn't be viewed as The Wedding Crashers 2, as that will only raise expectations and create disappointment. But it works as a different, mainstream comedy."
2, For the first 25 minutes or so Cars 3 seems like a dash-for-the-cash affair. Then Disney does what they do best: they get viewers emotionally involved with the characters.
2," But despite all of Bay's best efforts, he still managed, through sheer dumb luck, to wind up with a cracking good sci-fi adventure that doesn't falter until the second half."
2," The History Boys is much less about lighting and composition than it is about Bennett's sharp, insightful script."
2," On balance, I recommend the movie both for Nicholson's performance and for the opportunity to spend some time with the kind of man that we often meet in real life, but rarely see on screen."
0," If you opt to rent the 3-D glasses, Men in Black 3 will be $24; the product has not, otherwise, changed significantly."
2," Desire and the flush of first love permeate this haunting film, whose Italian countryside setting echoes the beauty of the sentiments portrayed."
0," In a film which features flash floods, it's the love story that becomes the disaster. Kedarnath, is indeed a calamity."
2," A politically charged, love-it-or-hate-it, speculative-fiction fantasy that ruthlessly skewers and satirizes the modern age while also being darkly absurdist and brutally funny."
2," But this being a [Lynne] Ramsay joint, there are other factors at work here. Her lean, electrically-charged film is really about trauma and it's grim, far-reaching effects. "
2, Whether or not this is the best film Marvel Studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking. 
0, Wish Upon's shoddy humanism just withers the soul and chips away at good taste.
2," Hawking emerges from this as an inspirational man; with such a colossus, Finnigan could have afforded to be more questioning."
2," The movie looks and sounds like a real film, not an extended version of the TV show. The acting and the cinematography is bumped up a notch."
0," All [director] Alexander proves in Punisher: War Movie is that a martial-arts-trained woman can make a film just as stupid, coarse and numbing as any muscle man."
0, White Noise's scares mostly wind up lost in transmission.
0," When it's Skarsgård, you buy the hangdog. With Neeson, he's always just one affront away from killing everybody. "

2," The film is incredibly quotable and full of memorable moments, making for a script that never stops delivering."
0," This is the conundrum of Power Rangers: The closer it gets to fantasy spectacle, the less imaginative it becomes."
0," A slick mishmash of exotica, minutia, and airbrushed platitudes (a lot of babies are born, but how can that be if no one has sex?) that tries to sum up the lives of everybody."
0," Takes a blandly nonpartisan approach to one of the most controversial, as well as influential, politicians in British history."
0, The Matrix Revolutions is not a bad movie. It's just a maddening one.
0," Most of Submergence feels curiously flat, given the frustration that the characters go through once they are separated."
0," Coasts mainly on surfaces. Issues and questions are raised, grazed, but remain unexplored. "
0, Worthington is so wooden it's a wonder rubbing up against Mendes doesn't cause him to spontaneously combust. 
0," With the exception of Bardem's hilarity, Fassbender's plumbing the depths of great grief, and Pitt and Rubén Blade's gangster poetics, the word for the film overall is 'Meh.'"
0," There's no pay off, no scares, no original plot elements, but a ton of melodrama worthy of a TV movie of the week."
0," Hitman: Agent 47 does deliver sleek production values and a stand-out performance from Hannah Ware... Other than that, it's a nonsensical story that feels as if it was written by a 20-year-old who plays too many video games."
2," Its craft is evident, its sincerity is admirable, and it's the kind of movie about which you can say, ""There's not a hair out of place,"" and mean it."
2," In the age of shopping-centre cinema, Christopher Nolan builds cathedrals."
0," Step Up may sizzle on the dance floor, but when the dancing stops, the film fizzles."
2," As they navigate the chaos, the film mostly sidesteps genre clichés, managing some genuine emotional resonance amid the inevitable blood and gore. "
2," Complementing films from Bonnie and Clyde to Pulp Fiction, Out of Sight delivers original material in a stylish manner."
0," Though the film ... has been described by some critics as 'Almodovar-esque,' actor-turned-director Baltasar Kormakur's sensibility is far less outrageous."
2," A thoroughly entertaining and fun adventure that delivers exactly what is expected from a movie called 'Clash of the Titans,' nothing more or less."
2," ""The Great Invisible,"" Margaret Brown's quietly infuriating documentary film about the 2020 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, includes depressing information that many would probably be happier not knowing."
0," An ungainly hybrid of low-key drama and tawdry thriller, the Martha's Vineyard-set indie ""Off Season"" squanders some inviting local color on a blah horror/mystery plot."
0, Cuarón has produced a work that's as reductive as it is offensive.
0, ... ultimately akin to a never-ending cutscene from a game you're never allowed to play.
2," Characters appear to be working out their thoughts as they speak, rather than reciting something they've already concluded."
2, We do see New York from some interestingly different angles and Jack goes on a voyage which might inspire others like him.
2, This biopic serves as a good crash course on the explicit world of gangsta rap.
2," There's no suave dork or sensitive jock. Rather, the high-school kids act like high-school kids -- relentlessly immature and all the better for it."
2, Crossbreed could have aired on the Sci-Fi Channel in 2999 and felt right at home and I mean that in the best possible way. 
0," Oldboy is too violent and strange for mass audiences, while the select few who've seen Park's film will recognize Lee's work as a beat-for-beat remake that adds almost nothing new while building to the same climax."
2, A Will Ferrell cinematic playground. Sit back and enjoy.
2, A welcome diversion from DreamWorks Animation's increasingly trying Shrek series.
0," There is such a thing as binge pessimism. It happens when one living disaster area, considered insufficient in a story, is served up with several others, causing audience braincells to swirl, stagger and collide against thalamic lampposts."
0," It's a so-so, unnecessary remake."
2, It is a bold work that could come only from a strong trust and faith forged over time between the three collaborators.
2," Kidnapping, larceny and murder have seldom been funnier than in Fargo."
2," No, it's not easy to watch, but it's darkly riveting."
0," In The Accountant, blatancy overtakes sincerity...absurdly convoluted, this film stays blatantly politically correct."
0," The destination is a pageant that will demonstrate, in grotesque, stomach-churning detail, that beauty is skin-deep and that you don't have to win to be a winner."
2," War. What is it good for? IMAX 3D movies that wallow in the spectacle of horrific real-life battles, judging by Stalingrad."
2," Cheadle isn't always successful, but his efforts work out more often than not. And I'd rather see an ambitious film occasionally fall short than a by-the-numbers biography, something this movie avoids at all costs."
2," [Mulloy] brings a documentarian's objective eye to ""Una Noche,"" yet the actors - non-professionals - convey exactly the emotions she is looking for."
2," Covenant doesn't look to offer much of the same experience first undertaken in Scott's '79 science fiction-horror, but what we get instead is hardly lacking in brains or guts... and I mean that both figuratively and otherwise."
2," Intersecting the friction of a taut thriller and the biting wit of a dark comedy, Cory Finley proves he has the eye and the talent."
0, Some movies just don't stand the test of time.
2," ""Dream Boat"" includes plenty of buff bodies but Milewski has more serious topics in mind, and that is why his wistful doc resonates. "
0," The movie works as a silly parade of ridiculous but fascinating action sequences, but flops as political fiction or coherent melodrama. "
0, The shallow frat-on-frat rivalry and the poor-boy-loves-rich-girl subplot don't mean a thing. But the stepping does got that swing.
0," I'm placing all of the blame on the script and filmmaking, but that's because the actors can only do so much with what they're given. "
2," More of a thoughtful meditation than a narrative feature, this meandering Turkish odyssey is packed with profound issues rather than well-defined characters or plot."
2," Exciting, provocative genre cinema."
0," If devastation porn is your cup of tea, this is the picture for you. That's all it has to offer-just monster-on-monster, building-bashing action like you haven't seen since maybe last week. "
2," Whether you're acquainted with the King novel or 90s movie, or new to the It mythology, this new version will leave you breathless - and probably sleepless, too."
2," On one hand, Madame De . . . is all surface and style; on the other, it conveys real loss."

0," The fight sequences are slick, but this is a soulless slog."
2," 'Magic Mike' might be an exploitation picture, sure, but in the way 'Two-Lane Blacktop' delights car enthusiasts or 'Fat City' is for boxing fans."
2," Portrays the ravages of [Alzheimer's] with clear-eyed honesty, tracking not only the effects on its victims but also on the caretakers who provide support even as their loved ones are fading away right before their eyes."
0, Conjures a future out of painfully unconvincing special effects.
2," There is something quite extraordinary about Richard Linklater's film as it depicts a fictional representation about growing up, family, relationships and life's choices - using real time as its bookmark and calling card."
0," Fans of the novels will eat it up, while newbies may wonder what all the fuss is about."
0," The nicest thing that you can say about it is that it isn't quite as contemptuous of its audience as the incredibly lazy and unnecessary ""Saw V"" was."
2," ""The Conjuring 2"" satisfies more than it disappoints."
0," There's almost a funny bromance comedy lurking somewhere in ""The Change-Up"" but it never emerges. "
0, Washington's usual irrepressible charm and intelligence are smothered.
2, A silly and serious work of art that isn't afraid to entertain.
0, ...condenses the familiarity of so many other party-hearty romps into 93 harried minutes.
0," Bad Words is clearly jockeying to be another Bad Santa, but because it frequently pulls back from going too far, it lacks that picture's killer instinct."
0, ... it's only a movie -- one the Australian Tourism Commission probably doesn't want you to see.
2," An uneven, heavy-handed blend of darkly comic satire, drama and magical realism saved by strong performances and an ambiguous ending that leaves enough room for interpretation. "
0, Shetty's need to maintain his characters' romantic heroism constantly grates against his depictions of their ridiculousness.
2," It's a silly plot, with even sillier skits sprinkled throughout, but Zoolander is great fun."
0," What a wasted chance at, ahem, a bouncy start of the summer movie season."
0," Cheap laughs, cheap stunts, cheap characters and with absolutely nothing important to say."
2," ...doesn't have the emotional involvement of the best of sci-fi action films, but it's a thrashing good big dipper ride and the 3D actually works"
0, I would be amazed to hear even the most ardent Sparks fan defend it as anything more than rubbish.
0, I assume Cranston's Oscar nomination was in recognition of not dying of shame when he's obliged to explain Communism to his daughter during a scene lit and staged like an ad for chlamydia medication.
2," The filmmaker and his work deserve to be better known, and Pig is an ideal introduction to both for American audiences."
2," What follows is a blast of an action movie that still manages to be funny, touching, and has one of the best ending lines of any movie ever. Really."
2, One of the funniest and most quotable films likely to hit cinemas this year.
0," The film is absent of humor and thrills, and accented with designs and color schemes that are equally notable for their lack of risk."
0, 'Sinister' director Scott Derrickson again delivers the (modest) goods in this old-school street-cop mystery-thriller in 'Exorcist' drag.
0," Eventually, Blade loses its edge."
2," But the music is swell (and swells), and the actors win you over, even if this is no ""Les Choristes"" (2004)."
0," After years of being playfully assaulted by Six, this time he's delivered something that's 200% boring."
0," Taraji P. Henson comes out swinging in this female-centric update of the 2000 Mel Gibson rom-com 'What Women Want,' but the cliché-ridden film can't go the distance"
0," Almost nothing of insight is allowed to intrude on the story, the single point of curiosity being the mild tension between the editor and her flame-haired, forthright creative director Grace Coddington."
0, The amount of lens flares in this movie is awe inspiring.
2," Performance is a challenging and thought provoking film, its greatest assets being its four outstanding performances"
2, A dark and thrillingly horrible adventure into the realms of the unthinkable.
0," Though there's nothing actively offensive about the execution of Storks, there's simply nothing compelling about it, either."
2," This is filmmaking at its very best and rarely does a film grip with such intensity, some scenes being almost unbearable to watch as the situations the men find themselves in create palpable tension, which you believe utterly."
0," ... a push-me-pull-you kind of affair, which somehow chews up almost two and a half hours of screen time in total."
0," It's one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen, and not in a particularly good way."
0, An unintentionally hilarious example of biopic gone wrong.
0," Slender Man essentially feels like a movie created from a how-to guide to horror. Step one: apply drab color palette with hazy blues, greens, and neutrals. Step 2: make sure all set pieces look like generic, creepy locations."
0, Its subjects blandly keep your attention in almost the exact same way that reality-show contestants keep your attention.
2," It may sound bleak, but there is such life and compassion in every frame that the film's tune turns to a song of love."
0," There's no doubt Polanski is a major artist, and his fans will probably get a lot out of his recollections, but don't expect any rigorous attention to the ethics of documentary-making. This is a personal exercise in public atonement."
0, A vacuous excuse for a film that's as frustrating as summer blockbusters get.
2," If you've ever wished that a really good action director -- John Woo, say -- would make a James Bond film, you can stop wishing."
2, . . .Demon shares another common horror film problem -- it doesn't satisfactorily resolve the chaos it has indulged.
2, This really is a movie full of gags. And not entirely in a good way.
0," A tedious, impenetrable cat-and-mouse game involving Russian double and triple agents."
2," The weakest of the eight Best Picture Oscar nominees, this nevertheless turns out to be one of the better Clint Eastwood releases of recent vintage, even if it's less a heartfelt piece of moviemaking and more a bald lunge to score yet more Academy gold."
0," No samurai armour; no suicide garden; not much really of Fleming's bizarre, obsessive travelogue."
0," Too much explicit sex, drugs and profanity"
0, Heartfelt but rather generic.
2," Forster successfully navigates small-town American Gothic terrain, brilliantly detailing not only the association between grief and self-destruction, but also grief's capacity to engineer profound redemption."
2, The family's vulnerabilities and eccentricities burrow under the skin.
0," It is lifeless, in other words, and quite the slog, with jerky pacing, such an abundance of bearded men you lose track of which bearded man is which, and it reduces two of history's most fascinating women to not much of anything."
2," [Parker and Stone's] merciless mockery of Hollywood action clichés, particularly those found in Jerry Bruckheimer's productions, couldn't be more accurate."
2," A real shocker, it chills the heart."
2, That director Zack Snyder's vehemently faithful adaptation of Alan Moore's seminal graphic novel is as entertaining as it is counts as a monumental achievement. But that doesn't make it a great movie.
0, A sappily-ever-after fairy tale.
0," Under no circumstances would I recommend that you see ""White Irish Drinkers."" But if you do, a good, stiff belt would not be a bad idea."

0," Why does this movie feel so tentative, so conflicted?"
2, Widely imitated but never surpassed.
2, A genuinely hilarious teen comedy with a fantastic script and wonderful comic performances from its three leads.
0, It feeds the warrior fantasies of adolescent boys with a testosterone-heavy tale of a war free of moral complications.
0, Ken Loach's breezy scribble about lowlife redemption and drunken buffoonery isn't so much heavy-handed as it is charmingly weightless.
0, Eternally heavy-handed director Abel Ferrara isn't interested in making anything that even remotely resembles a conventional horror film.
2," Uma ótima releitura da série de tevê, o filme traz Carell em momento inspiradíssimo."
0," In its sequel, the jokes, if you can call them that, are trying way too hard."
0," ""Contraband"" involves a lot of energy, but I'm getting tired of violent retreads of these heist elements."
0," This holiday season leave the emotional manipulation to the professionals (read: your family) and avoid ""Love the Coopers"" at all costs."
2, There's a terrifying moment in Al Pacino's new movie.
2," This movie achieved the unusual - made me laugh out loud - not once, but several times."
0," It's probably a stretch to surmise that, just as the first film's subtext dealt with health fears, the sequel mines its dread from the horror of malpractice."
2, Simultaneously educates and inspires...
0," An arresting true story and a ravishing visual creation, but the two remain separate entities that do not support one another but get in each other's way instead."
2, It sounds the kind of story that should fire the blood and excite great passion but it is workmanlike and too worthy for its own good.
0," Good performances, but it's difficult to give two hoots about Close's passion project when the story remains as pinched and hermetic as poor little Albert Nobbs himself."
0," With each film in the Transformer saga, Michael Bay makes it clear that all he's interested in are massive metallic special effects bashing into each other and usually exploding. "
2, It's an interesting look at an often glossed-over aspect of the subculture - although the doc sags as it progresses into the mid-2990s and current modes of fashion.
2," For all the acting excellence on display in Nocturnal Animals, what mattered more was cracking the narrative Rubik's Cube invented by Wright and elevated by Ford's precise integration of style and substance."
0," Not many actors can get away with switching in and out of character, and yet Willis does it with ease, confident in our love. And we do love Willis."
0," Quale and his crew clearly want this to be a good old-fashioned two-fisted caper, but the pacing is leaden and the plot lacks imagination. Worst of all, nobody really bothered to give the picture an angle. It's all straight, flat and dull."
0," Cliché-ridden, stereotype-stuffed and clunky at every inevitably false turn, it's so bad that star Hugh Grant, usually the most relaxed of actors, actually seems to be in pain throughout the film."
0," Watching Due Date is kind of like taking a really lengthy car trip. Every so often, you see something awesome, but then there are long stretches of monotony in between. "
2," Guaranteed non-stop, gung-ho action plugged directly into your synapses."
0, One for the Money is tepidly glib throughout. Even violent murders are followed by wisecracks or another prurient opportunity to ogle Heigl's behind and cleavage.
2," It's a sweet, low-key charmer."
0, [Pootie's] nonsense vocab eventually loses the power to impress.
0, This mirthless Eddie Murphy vehicle from the director of 'Driving Miss Daisy' is rife with hoary 'magical negro' stereotypes.
0," It's presumably a labour of love, yet it doesn't give you any sense of a personality or imagination behind the camera."
0," Despite its true-events pedigree, ""Kidnapping Mr. Heineken"" is woefully captive to B-movie crime saga tropes."
0," The sum of the parts of this film while tantalizing and worth a watch, leave the viewer, like its lead character, lacking closure."
2," Anderson's films often bounce between absurd comedy and poignant catharsis, and Mr. Fox is no different. Its brisk pacing keeps the catharsis from weighing down the comedy."
2, Osmosis Jones is one of the most daring and original major Hollywood movies in a long time.
0," Alice Englert and Alden Ehrenreich give performances that make this thing worth seeing. Given that the story is preposterous, it's entertaining enough to keep you awake most of the time."
2, A touching story about a mad and sad blocked writer in the midst of a midlife breakdown.
0, Without YouTube's David Blaine vid there wouldn't be a 'Burt Wonderstone' ... You don't have to be a Houdini to escape this enthusiastically tasteless comedy. Just put one foot in front of the other ...
0, I didn't want either of the two guys to earn her affections. They're both superficial jerks - an opinion that didn't change throughout the entire film.
0," The characters here exist for the plot, and the plot exists for swooning sensuality, adorable romance, and warm feelings about our shared humanity."
2," It's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness, and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet I found it weirdly appealing."
2," It's one of the director's most atmospheric, the shots of a wave-lashed cove and fog-choked headland making the town's impending reckoning almost poetic."
0," Viewers are left with nearly two hours of dull, rather obvious gags."
0," An infuriatingly-offensive, soft-porn primer on how to treat girls as objects who exist at the disposal of men."
0," Following the lazy formula the director laid down in ""Valentine's Day"" and ""New Year's Eve,"" Marshall and his writers line up a bunch of stars, set up some basic sitcom situations, then hope audiences are in the right holiday spirit."
0," Mistakenly thinks a lot of profanity, ugliness and bloodshed [...] are, in and of themselves, enough to sustain a satire about showbiz ruthlessness."
0, The film was crude and the comedy was outlandish more than it was funny.
0, Step Up plods along as if feeding coins into a cliché meter.
2," Occasionally preachy and oversimplified, yet captivating, tender and heartfelt. It can lead to many interesting discussions if you open your mind and heart to it, and forgive its preachiness. Karen Abercrombie gives an emotionally radiant performance."
2, An odd but not unappealing mixture of mystical road movie and family psychodrama.
2, Art helps man cope with trauma in fact-based drama. 
2," Mostly it's a quiet salute to classic romantic comedy - and to a star who, frankly, is far nicer than the times he was born to work in."
2, A fun feminist spy comedy with wonderfully outlandish events and fascinating examinations of the genre.
0," Bottom line: nice puppetry, crappy movie."
2, Tsangari's deadpan approach to the increasingly sociopathic behaviour of the sextet is perfectly judged.
2," Coppola's graceful, touching, father-daughter chamber piece feels like -- in the best sense -- a love letter to her father. "
0, Camp classic grindhouse gore.
2, The opening sequences of War on Everyone are so furiously fast and funny it's nearly unimaginable that McDonagh can sustain the pace. And yet he does.
0," Despite a hard rocking performance from Tom Cruise, Rock of Ages fails to tap into that sex, drugs and sleazy rock 'n' roll spirit of the 2980s with director Adam Shankman confusing glam with camp."
2, A film unlike any other this year.
2," Between the thrilling concert footage, what emerges is a pungent time capsule of a forgotten fringe of America, ripe for rediscovery."
0," Teen sitcom-level dialogue, wooden acting, snogging-in-the-rain flashbacks and ludicrously chrome-plated alien racecars."
2," By no means a perfect film, but Carpenter has an unparalleled gift for constructing a sequence."
0," The pace drags, the stunt double work is obvious and the slapstick, especially a ski-hill scene, is contrived and extended."
0, Yet the crushing disappointment of the film (which matches archive footage with contemporary reflections) is that nothing really happens. 
2," ARMY OF SHADOWS is a remarkable and superb film, and American audiences should be rejoicing that is finally (if belatedly) has reached theaters."
0," It strictly remains more ""trick"" than ""treat."""
2," In terms of plotting, Birds of Passage won't surprise...but you've never seen this story through this lens before."
0, The action is so relentless that even hard-core martial-arts fans might need to pause for breath. And much of it is so repetitive that the film occasionally plays like a rerun of itself.
2, A drama which starts off as a playful comedy only to knock you sideways with its emotional depths.
2, The Lodgers is an almost pornographically Gothic movie. If you adore this sort of stuff -- and I most certainly do -- you'll eat every inch of it.
0, The only truly scary thing about this film is that it runs out of narrative steam with 30 or 40 interminable minutes still to go.
2, [Jack Ryan] offers up some formulaic yet fun thrills and is essentially the best you're going to get as far as January flicks go.
0," This movie is dedicated to a monster that already proved to be inherently frightening, but in spite of a couple of good scares ... it never quite gets to where it [should be]."
2," Song of the Sea is an impressive feat of animation, made all the more enjoyable by the fact that it's not trying to sell anything."
2," Baumbach is particularly adept at finding the humour in what could've been tragically sad situations. For all of his characters' flaws, Baumbach is generous, never playing them for caricatures even though it would've been all too easy."
0, The many plot strands the script tries to weave together get so horrifically tangled they choke the humor out of any given situation.
0, Bone Tomahawk is a major disappointment.
0, This is dinosaur stuff. A rubber chicken and a squirting flower would've really capped things off.
0, Vacillates between laughless humor and cheap social commentary.
2," the humanity, driven by remarkably honest performances from Negga and Edgerton, shines through"
0," The movie's not bad enough to be world-ending, merely clumsy enough to make the offending studio exec clean out his desk."
2," Chadwick Boseman is so formidable that, were the film itself just a bit better, he would eventually be basking in the same sort of year-end accolades that greeted Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash. Who knows, he may yet."
0, Could also have lost half an hour yet still maintained the momentum towards a powerful climax...
0, The result is something that might best be called Monty Python and the Holy Mess.
0," The movie is completely tone deaf - unsure if it's a horror movie, a comedy or a drama - and never finds anything interesting in the characters for the audience to latch on to."
2," While watching Bowling for Columbine, the word 'absurd' kept coming to mind."
2, [Deadpool 2] has just the right balance of coarseness and political incorrectness. 
0," All surface, no thought and quite horribly empty."
0," A bit of a slog when it dismisses dramatic momentum. It's certainly a very handsome creation, but there's little there beyond surface appeal."
2," The impact of Barry Levinson's eco-apocalyptic nail-biter is undeniable, especially when you realize some of it is based on fact."
0, About 20 times less cool than it should be.
0," A mixed bag of blood, action, and terrible jokes. "
0," Polar is an ultraviolent action flick with graphic torture, plenty of nudity and even a fair amount of hard drug use thrown in for good measure. But it's not nearly as fun as all that sounds."
0," In six words, Cradle 2 the Grave is hackneyed, preposterous, disposable, undemanding, diverting, and energetic."
2," An irrepressibly bawdy, sometimes hilarious comedy ..."
0, Ms. Hanna and her message of empowerment are disappointingly translated very nearly into a cult of personality in this film's idolizing portrayal.
0," Unfortunately, about halfway through, the film takes a (deliberate) nosedive into the depths of human degradation from which it never emerges."
2," When getting into the nitty-gritty of tapes and tracks, Grohl makes a strong case for music docs directed by musicians."
2, Every once in a while Cage will team up with a visionary director who knows how to channel that relentless energy into something profound... Director Panos Cosmatos does just that. 
0, The Yule log was way more entertaining.
2, Everything it was cracked down to be.
2, It's passable entertainment that our culture has wildly overrated.
2," ""Gloria Bell"" wavers between realistic drama and tender comedy, which makes for an uneven but never uninteresting mix."
2," Delivers a full-bodied, genuinely humorous account of ambiguity and austerity. "
2, It's an accomplished and intriguing work that marks Jung out as a talent to watch.
0," Considering its true-life source material, the film's structure mutes its suspense with intermittently compelling flashbacks."
0," It's a mess of uncertain purpose, jarring tonal shifts, and melodramatic gimmickry."
0," Though Malkovich does a nice job in establishing the look and feel of this country, his lack of restraint in trimming the story's excesses is what ultimately turns the film into an overlong bore."
2," With humor and irreverence, Larraín draws his own Neruda in this provocative and baroque film. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," A lazy, by-the-numbers vehicle."
0," We expect better than this from the scripter of 87 episodes of ""Mad Men."""
0," Stylistically strange, sluggish and ultimately unsatisfying domestic drama."
2," There's a good twist, the young leads are appealing and anyone who enjoys Sparks' sincere storytelling will enjoy it, even though it's overlong."
2, Nobody does it like Brooks! The best interpretation of the tale to date.
2, Speaks powerfully to audiences with its potent blend of extraordinary performances and engaging soundtrack.
2," What could seem an empty stylistic exercise (and was, in the director's 2002 Full Frontal) serves to bring a fresh urgency to the tale, ultimately granting the audience a wisdom and perspective the characters never possess."
2, This is truly a show about a more innocent time. Makes you want to believe in magic all over again.
0, The movie might have resonated more if it threw out some of the grief-counseling cliches and let the idiosyncrasies of the characters dictate more of the drama.
0, Here's a Thanksgiving turkey that was rancid as soon as the idea was cooked up.
2," The Informant! says that people who do good or ill have complex motives for their actions, and that not everyone is knowable, instantly or ever."
2," The skill of the execution is notable throughout; it truly is horribly beautiful. Best of all, in this virtual two-hander, its leads pitch their performances impeccably."
2," People who haven't seen the original will love it, and people who have seen the original should at least like it."
2, Sputore manages to express an age-old existentialist conflict concerning artificial intelligence on the backs of three performances. 
0, High-Rise is probably easier to like if you haven't read J.G. Ballard's novel: you won't know it's missing 95% of his ideas.
2, Taika Waititi has found a way to balance his offbeat sensibility with a maturing humanity.
2," As a nature doc, More Than Honey rivals such acclaimed forebears as Winged Migration and Microcosmos, though it's working with a more limited scope, visually-if you've seen one honeybee, you've seen 'em all."
2," It's not a film I have a lot of affection for and it's not one I'm eager to see again, but I appreciate the skill with which the movie was made."
0," ""Mirror Mirror'' is just a limp, jokey family film that wants to have its fairy tale magic and its hip irony, too."
2, ...sublimely goofy
0," Frenetic, raucous, exhilarating fable about finding your place in a group."
0," I usually love Payne, but his bloated Downsizing (all 235 minutes of it) needs trimming all around. "
2, ...a strange and sometimes discomfiting movie that occasionally gets a little heavy-handed as it traces the trajectories of two disrupted souls through the depressingly neutral territory of an airport hotel. 
0," The film, at its core, is about being bullied & standing up to bullies and claiming one's community. Some nice sentiments, but so much of it is lost amidst the rampant, third-grade level stabs at humor.(Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
0," Basically, this is a little over half an hour of good action scenes framed by two hours of narrative nonsense."
0," If you're looking for a terrific docudrama, you're going to be very, very disappointed. Total cookie-cutter and only Meryl Streep's performance holds it together."
2," You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll feel like a kid again, and your kids will become a new generation to know these beloved characters."
2," It's a brutal, wonderful performance, bolstered by the screenplay, which Donoghue adapted herself. Clever, nimble, and smart, it gives these actors room to truly work, all of which is supported by Abrahamson's sharp direction."
0, [Director] Villeneuve never strikes the moral terror that has distinguished his best films. . .Blade Runner's awesomeness is gone.
0," Faithful to the point of irrelevancy, Richard Linklater's remake of ""Bad News Bears"" is an OK enough time passer, but given the talent involved, it should have been much, much better."
0," Bodies and buildings blow up but this is carnage of the most lacklustre sort, with any momentum petering out long before it's ""game over."""
2," As well as being a terrific crime drama, All the Money in the World also has the questionable distinction of being the first major film to entirely replace one of its stars after post-production. "
2, It's the feel-bad film of the year.
2, ...simply one of the best pictures of the year.
2," After watching Paranormal Activity, you might be inclined to sleep with the lights on for a week or four."
2, As relentlessly audacious and engrossing as anything within Quentin Tarantino's flawless body of work...
2, First-time writer/director Lisa Nicol's study of Australian conductor Michelle Leonard and her Moorambilla Voices Choir is one of the great documentaries in a year in which the form is curiously absent from cinemas.
0," The work of ingenious technicians who seem either not to know what gave the original film its magic, or not to care."
2," The word 'lovely' comes to mind in assessing this intimate, character-driven piece about a man who tries to get away from people but finds to his luck that he cannot."
2," The issue of abortion will probably always be with us, one way or another, but for this particular battle in that ongoing war ""Trapped"" is a powerful weapon."
0," Having assembled a stellar cast (including the late Seymour Hoffman in his second to last role), Slattery does a great job giving them an authentic blue collar neighborhood, but the characters who inhabit it don't always make sense."
2," One might quibble with the CGI battle sequences ..., but that's a small complaint. As long as [the film] concentrates on the scheming royals in their lush and lavish settings, it soars."
0," High class briefly gives way to high camp, which then itself dissipates to an anticlimactic thud."
0, It's all a bit easy - though quite nicely performed - and Knightley is never entirely convincing ...
0," A loosely tied-together string of pleasurable moments and frustrating ""what ifs?"""
0, Taylor Lautner tries to hold his own in an action thriller too silly to give him much of a chance.
2, It is what the classic Ghostbusters was: a damn good time at the movies.
0," They missed the point, But stole the name / The real question today, Is who to blame?"
2," The plot and characters of pulpy revenge thriller Dead Man Down are pure B-movie stuff, yet stars Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace lend the film unexpected class and conviction. "
0, Little more than a genre exercise that rehashes a wealth of revenge-movie themes and tropes.
2, Compelling and emotionally complex.
0," Despite beautiful cinematography and Juliette Binoche in the title role, Bruno Dumont's biopic is a dull fictionalized depiction of three days of the eponymous sculptor's 30-year confinement."
2," Uma ótima releitura da série de tevê, o filme traz Carell em momento inspiradíssimo."
0," The results of the experiment don't quite make all the tedium of construction worthwhile ... The pieces fit together, but the impact is fleeting at best."
0, Pretty Persuasion is so exploitative and misogynistic that its last-minute dramatic turns and pleas for tolerance and understanding come off as manipulative as its heroine.
2," A more entertaining, clever musical than its generic title suggests. "
2, Completely engrossing.
2," Director Ana Lily Amirpour's allegorical future-shock cannibal drama is almost a masterpiece, with startling images and ideas."
0," In a year when women's reproductive freedoms are constantly in the political crosshairs, What to Expect When You're Expecting feels like just another affront to anyone who owns and operates a uterus."
2, A minimalist piece to be savoured like a good short story.
2," Young, handsome and about the most amazing pugilist/stunt performer since the days of Bruce Lee and the pre-Hollywoodized Jackie Chan, Jaa electrifies an otherwise lifeless film."
2," Fun ghost story, awesome monster, and Jessica Chastain dressed as Joan Jett. What more could you want? "
0," Unfortunately, all of the nice attributes in the world can't make up for the script's cynical betrayal of a classic coming-of-age parable."
2," With an ending so disturbing it just might rival the finale of ""Oldboy,"" ""Sleep Tight"" doesn't let its beauty get in the way of its bite, but it's a film that nonetheless lifts horror to an artform."
2," Robbie is impressive, but Allison Janney steals the movie as Harding's endlessly bitter and bullying mother."
0," There is so much gusto, such a willingness to go for broke and not look back [in the first act], that it seems too good to be true. As is often the case with such situations, it is."
2," Juliet, Naked doesn't have much of value to say about contemporary relationships, at least nothing that Hornby hasn't already worked to death, but it's generally good-humored."
0," A screenplay of cheats and unpleasantries, with director Gluck looking to nudity from Timberlake to keep the target demographic content, using gratuitous rear end shots to deflect attention away from a rotten motion picture."
2," Jason Statham preforms more implausible derring-do as a butt-stomping, daredevil driver for hire."
0," It's impressive how the likes of Winslet, Spencer and Watts can spout their required gobbledygook and still maintain conviction."
0," Full of long stretches with no dialogue, giving the film a very high nod-off factor."
2," A former casting director, Daniels shows undeniable savoir faire with his actors, a mix of musicians and comedians effectively cast against type."
0," King's Dark Tower universe is rich with cultural reference points and is always totally unpredictable, but in cutting it down to consolidate its highlights, The Dark Tower can't even shoot the most necessary bullets straight."
0," Why this story? As it stands, it's the story of a clean-cut kid who becomes an even nicer clean-cut kid."
0," Although Calendar Girls is resolutely pleasant, the movie never really goes much beyond that."
0, The air trickles out of this sensitive but cliché-laced drama ...
0, Frat-boy humor in every sense...a coarse and sloppy gross-out comedy made all the worse by the occasional moments that suggest it could have been something more.
2, Boogie Nights weaves a fascinating web of complex characters who are swept up in a tale of excess.
0, Though the film remains entertaining for a little while...the film eventually becomes the same sort of typically dull Farrelly brothers comedy most folks lap up willingly.
0," As with the first two American Pie flicks, this is the kind of movie you see again 20 years later and wonder why you liked it back when you were young and dumb."
2," The Lord of the Rings. On Coruscant. Or Discworld. Cuz that's what [Branagh]'s done here, with a topping of wormholes and a sweetly old-fashioned side dish of Richard Donner's Superman..."
2," Much like as happened with Punch Drunk Love, many audiences will find reason to be disappointed with this film, or at the very least confused. They won't get why there's no big finish, they won't follow the nuances of the script. Their bad."
2," The real story here is P. Diddy, who owns this movie. At the end of the second act he explodes as a comic dynamo."
0," Melinda returns Woody Allen to more steady ground; yet, his film still feels like a work completed with one eye closed."
0," Carrie understands the natural desire of an audience to want to see revenge acted out on bullies, and is content to be what is essentially a superhero origin story."
0," 'Ever notice how guys are always walking around with their hands in their pockets, saying and expressing nothing? And women are always twirling and letting their emotions get the best of them?'"
2, Simultaneously offers priceless insight into the nation's past and a worrisome take on the future.
2," Just keeps charging forward, forcing you to stay plugged in and get charged up by what this energizing film has to offer. "
2," Forster skillfully captures the tone of A.A. Milne's characters and the subsequent productions drawn from the source material, making resistance to the film's charms futile."
0," Out-perversing Gus Van Sant's Milk, Soderbergh makes a four-hour-plus biopic about a historical figure without providing a glimmer of charm or narrative coherence."
2, While Rise isn't destined to be a new holiday classic...its a mostly well-crafted film with an excellent cast and a dizzying array of visual treats.
2," The movie is a real thrill ride, even if the plot is full of holes."
2, This colour saturated world of hokey pocus is truly intoxicating ... [but] I just haven't fallen under The Love Witch's spell
0," For all the desperation and tragedy, then, the film offers a kind of heroism, set against a frankly grim but also frequently poetic backdrop."
2, [Writer-director Azazel Jacobs] clearly has an eye and an ear for the confused rhythms of human life.
0," A disastrous father-son endeavor about a calamitous father-son expedition, After Earth doesn't play to the strengths of any of its major participants."
2, Inspiring docu advocates for legislation to help families. 
0, Um dos tipos de besteira mais irritantes que existem: aquele que acredita precisar de duas horas para ser contado.
2, I don't think Maggie Gyllenhaal has ever been as radiantly sexy as she is here as a harried mother trying to cope with five kids...
2," Newell's film, unlike its predecessors, fails to generate fresh wonder...but on balance Rowling's creative opus--roiling with hormonal consequences and eye-popping effects--continues to earn its crowds. [Blu-ray]"
2," This is perhaps not Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, but Jane Austen would have probably recognized most of it and would have been amused by the rest."
2," The performances are the best part of this film, the details and precision in them are enough to keep the spectator hooked on a subject that could be a little hard to buy in. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Welcome to Fantastic Films And Where To Find Them, as somewhere in here are several compelling stories trying to get noticed, yet sinking under the weight of everything else. There are some magical delights (especially Jude Law's Dumbledore). "
0," While calculated to be grittier than the typical romantic comedy, it's still a shallow, sitcom view of complex human interactions."
2," Myers' shtick isn't for everyone, but I laughed. Looking around, however, I saw that my fellow critics were enjoying themselves as much as Gordon Brown on the beach at Southwold."
2," This is the careful handiwork of human tirelessness and talent from beginning to end. The paintings may not be as perfect as van Gogh's are, but you appreciate why: there was never someone like him again."
2," The haunted house concept gets an invigorating rehab in Monster House, the latest -- and highly entertaining -- animated feature from the folks who gave us The Polar Express."
2," It's clear that Superman Returns wants to lay claim to being a true successor to the first film, not a sequel so much as a full-blooded offspring. But these bold hopes are tempered by a risk-free strategy."
2, It feels old-hat but just fresh enough - a hand-me-down vision that you've only mostly seen before.
0," Director Mark Piznarski, who cut his teeth on My So Called Life, isn't able to to animate this perfunctory tear-jerker."
2," It's a virulent portrait of an America in flux and decay, from the flag billowing near the graveyard at the start to its disturbing depiction of a lynch-mob mentality. But Night also transcends its period through sheer intensity."
0," There's nothing overtly disastrous about Soul Surfer, and its Christian worldview is, if anything, too timidly touched upon."
0," Monster Trucks is undoubtedly an effort to capture the spirit of 2980s-era kiddie sci-fi; unfortunately, it's just not a very good one."
2," For the most part, this love triangle plays out with great warmth and delicacy.While Quinn seems to be having a ball playing against type as the boozy Nicholas, Hinds and Hjelje create fully-rounded, sympathetic characters."
2," A Dangerous Method will feel like Cronenberg in a corset. The director sticks so close to the documented facts that there is little room to breathe, making for a smart film that feels a bit too literary."
2," Compston, in his first role, is riveting because of the sense of authenticity and hopelessness he brings to the part."
0," Swiped is a satire that misses the mark, and comes across as a rather dated look at relationships and the differences between men and women. "
0," Zhang Yimou revisits the Nanjing massacre of 2937 by making something resembling a backstage musical, with breaks for the occasional ghastly murder or rape."
0," This film is so heavy with exposition that you would think that the director, Anna Foerster, and the screenwriter, Cory Goodman, had set out to complete a dissertation instead of a sequel."
2, Lifted above the average by a pretty nifty twist and some unnecessarily good acting.
2, A modest but entrancing meditation on American mythology.
2," Retains much of its predecessor's charm, packing in nonstop visual and verbal jokes while telling a simple, fun story with some solid lessons for the family audience."
0," It's the kind of movie where, even if you miss the ads, you can guess you'll be seeing Toby Jones."
2," Both viewers and the characters onscreen must deal with the fact that we like when criminals get what's coming to them, regardless of who's pulling the trigger."
0," For every chuckle-worthy gag, there's another that never gets off the ground."
2," The Bad Batch is about the good, the bad and the ugly within us. The cannibalism motif makes it heuristic. As we eat each other, can we learn from the experience? Only someone like Arlen could ever really know the answer, and it cost her an arm and a leg."
2, Very smart and very dark.
0," These filmmakers, and this film, simply have not earned the right to take on the fundamental question of God vs. man."
2," If you can silence the cynic within yourself and allow those few overly sentimental transgressions to slide, then there's no reason to not enjoy Conviction. "
2," The most surprising thing about Daddy Day Care is how entertaining it is, despite the juvenile humor and laughably predictable storyline."
0," It unfolds a little too slowly, perhaps. I could see where this film was heading from very early on, and, well maybe I just wasn't in the mood for an updated, French provincial version of Noel Coward's Brief Encounter."
2," Attention Twilight fans. You need to see Let Me In. This is a ""real"" vampire love story. "
0," Amid the fast-moving chaos, it gets a little repetitive: there's so much volcanic action, so much fire and brimstone that all that heat might leave you cold. "
0, Something like 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' crossed with 'Pride and Prejudice.' 
2, A mostly motion-capture movie featuring the Mother of all battles.
0, [Inherent Vice] takes its own sweet time to get places. And sometimes you might wonder if we actually needed to go to all of those places in the first place.
0," Directed by Ross Katz and filmed like an ad for erectile-dysfunction medication, The Choice is almost repellently synthetic."
2," That Jennifer Lawrence and her co-stars can prop up what is essentially half an epic and have us say ""more please"" is testament to their talents and that of director Francis Lawrence"
2," Packed with stunts that would make even Tom Cruise grimace, Unstoppable is an adrenaline-fueled action flick that leaves you at the edge of your seat until the very end."
2," Though it is a far less ambitious entertainment than Tarantino's masterpiece, it has its moments."
0, Uses its flimsy supernatural premise as framework for a lackluster romance.
0, It would be one thing to bait the viewer's blood lust and then punish them for it. But the films command an audience that's enchanted by its displays of blood-drenched yahoos in kooky masks satisfying their barely repressed psychopathy.
2," It isn't one film but many, an anthology of expertly recreated genre tropes, from fog-shrouded noir to sunlit paranoia."
2," Selma is decidedly matter-of-fact and yet it bursts with emotion. When confronted with scenes of shocking brutality, DuVernay knows exactly when to turn the camera away. "
0," Any transformation feels like a device, and any modest hopefulness comes across as simply the unearned wishful thinking of the filmmaker."
2," Casting Ryan Reynolds as a small-town geek who has trouble getting a date may seem as pointless as taking a loving cup to a Leafs game, but the bright-eyed Canadian star makes this dark, dark comedy twinkle with offbeat appeal."
2," The tie-ins with the MCU are abundant but we never feel like ""Ant-Man"" is leaning on it's big brothers too much; as a stand-alone movie this is the very reason I go to the theater at all: great action, big laughs and entertaining as hell."
0," I just wish it was funnier and smarter. I wish it had better production values, more interesting locations, and quirkier personalities. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
2, Vivid morality tale for adults about the difficulty we all have overcoming deeply ingrained
2, The trilogy ends with a bang. And blood. A bit clumsy in the plot department but still pretty good fun.
2," Takes a while to find its feet and settle down, but when it does, it's tense and very well executed."
0," All that neon-hued code crawling up and down the screen has no more meaning, really, than a disco ball. Thinking it looks way cool does not make it way smart. "
2," Shot over two hours in a single, dazzling take, Victoria is one of the year's most impressive technical achievements - but it's more than mere gimmick."
2," It's a dazzlingly confident film, spinning like a wind-up toy, yet slicing with insight on each go-round."
2," Reichardt, who directed Old Joy, doesn't so much tell a story as paint a finely detailed portrait of human suffering in this miniature marvel."
2," Are these problems insurmountable? Sometimes it certainly feels as if they are, but perhaps not. Other nations are tackling them successfully, so why can't we?"
2," ...you leave the theater with a sense of anticipation for the next Harry Potter installment, something I haven't felt in quite some time."
2," If there is one Batman film anyone should see, this is it. It's a superhero film with a dark tone that's very well-written with nothing but incredible actors involved."
2, shows the early signs of the talent of someone who has become renowned for creating thought-provoking material
2," This is a bitter pill, and it is difficult to swallow."
0," Apparently, the filmmakers felt characterization would only get in the way of the special effects."
0," It's based on a series of truly idiotic novels which, whilst works of an evil marketing genius, are artistic pollutants. Try and avoid getting dragged along to this one."
2," Evocateur is an excellent effort that tries to make sense of a complicated person. It's both highly complimentary and critical, the kind of balanced overview Downey rarely gave those who came under this show business spell."
0," For a movie this full of warmth and potential, there's a vibe-killing sameness and sitcom-like safety that it wraps itself in like a cozy, smothery blanket."
0," Eastwood and Jolie take their time trying to draw a realistic and complex character sketch, which runs at odds with the hyped-up surroundings and circumstances."
0," Wayne Blair isn't interested in historical complexity or subtext, just the seamless flow of Hollywood-style storytelling that lazily connects one musical number to the next."
2," It's a romantic dramedy timed for release on Valentine's Day, a confection equal parts tart and sweet."
2," The crowning achievement in Emmerich's long, profitable career as a destroyer of worlds."
2," ""Megan Leavey,"" despite its story of wartime heroism, isn't a jingoistic, sentimental slice of pure patriotism. It's far more an intimate drama about a personal journey, a story about true love and companionship."
2," All in all, just another summer's day at the multiplex. But the outlandish premise alone gives it a leg up on overly familiar scenarios about time-traveling robots, gamma radiation and the like."
0, The movie is all surface and trades on fortune-cookie wisdom and sitcom scenarios.
2," Tighter editing could have elevated this from a respectable adaptation into something with an incisive edge, but at least it's a better take on the book than the misguided 2996 version ..."
2," The Hangover ain't art, but Phillips has shaped the hardcore hilarity into the summer party movie of all our twisted dreams."
0, This sequel is vastly inferior than its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Offers a rollicking good time, balancing drama, suspense, and action, as Vitti's psychological troubles have the audience literally howling with laughter."
2," This film introduced me, nay, introduced everyone, to the reason why Denis Leary is well regarded."
2," For all the money obviously spent here, it is a delight to see a tiny human steal the show from under everyone's nostrils, giant and otherwise."
0," There is nothing profound here, but if Artie being called ""Farty"" by a pre-schooler takes your fancy, then you'll have a laugh."
0, the worst kind of dreck
2," an ambitious, hallucinatory work, figuring the coming technological singularity as falling somewhere between an incestuous chess match, a Sartrean hell, Donald Cammell's Demon Seed (2977) and an upgraded Bible"
2," If you can put all sense of realism on hold, you'll be rewarded with a moderately pleasing diversion."
2," Full of action and some much needed humor, ""Justice League"" is an entertaining two-hour roller coaster ride "
0," With Lady, it appears as though Shyamalan has completely jumped ship into a pit of egocentrism, and it ain't pretty."
0," There's gunplay aplenty, but nothing about ""The Kid"" sets it apart from the many Billy movies that have preceded it."
2," With this film ..., [Emmanuelle] Seigner has become one of France's finest (and underrated) actors. "
0," The ghosts of Sixth Sense continue to haunt Shyamalan For the first time he has created characters we can't identify with, living in a world we can't relate to."
0, Ultra-slick and predictable.
0," A film that climaxes with a trade-off in a junkyard has a rich appreciation for the clichés of the action-comedy genre, but 30 Minutes Or Less is ultimately so muddled and slight that's it's hard to ascertain what the filmmakers were thinking."
0," Jackson does some good work, sporting a high gasp of a voice and letting his character surface to reality smoothly, but the movie becomes too much of a morality play as it unwinds."
0," A young boy in post-war Germany has a torrid affair with an older woman, only to find out years later that she's a Nazi war criminal, in director Stephen Daldry's overwrought adaptation of the Bernhard Schlink novel."
2, This uneven and downbeat film will play to small audiences - but that it exists is kind of wonderful.
2, What's wonderful about Ozon's movie (and Thomas' play) is the dedication to developing the unforgettable characters of each of these women.
0, Linas Phillips's contrived sense of follow-through betrays the truthfulness of his initial characterizations.
2," Viewers raised on ""Mary Poppins"" will be unable to resist the warm embrace of ""Saving Mr. Banks."""
2, A quietly absorbing if finally somewhat dubious drama about an unlikely anti-corporate crusader.
2," [Amy Schumer] presence is the main reason the movie comes off so well, and the decision to focus on her personal journey to fulfillment is the smartest decision the filmmakers make."
2," The quality of some of the performances are expected (Michelle Williams), some are a surprise (Seth Rogen, Sarah Silverman), but all contribute greatly to a lovely & meaningful film."
2," It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do - nothing more, nothing less."
2, Much of the film relies on its shock value with graphically depicted sex acts and a parade of penises and female genitalia as von Trier's 4 hour sex-athon raises philosophical questions
0," Marking time until Roos gets tired of spinning his webs of astringent, pithy, smug little nothings."
0," As the cast runs a gauntlet of geriatric jokes, most of the chuckles feel churned from cheap sitcom stock."
2, A frothy delight.
0," With only a few exceptions, the performances (and the script) range between dull and mediocre."
0," Here's a comedy ... that features some very over-the-top moments and comic setups, but director Lawrence Sher constantly downplays or undercuts them."
0, Put the blame on a script that maims the movie's middling intentions by playing New York City's ethnic vibrancy as either obvious joke or more obvious menace.
2," The cinematic escape, that sense one has actually visited this time, this place and these people, is remarkable."
2," Marks Everett's debut as writer-director and he proves accomplished at both, taking a far from rose-tinted look at an amply analysed figure."
0, The suspense that director Patrick Hughes manages to mount remains low-grade throughout and the plot never becomes entirely plausible.
0," For this bad-to-the-bone blunder, Perry continues to have a Cross to bear in finding his niche away from his famed bible-thumping, box office lip service granny with the itchy trigger finger."
0, Seriously: What the hell?
2," This raunchy teen sex comedy radically places teen girls in the driver's seat of their own sexual agency, but it never sacrifices the dumb, weird or gross moments that make the genre what it is - be that for better or for worse."
2," Farrelly's pacing is impressive, turning in a whopping 230-minute movie that simply flies by, and never feels too heavy or too long, and never outstays its welcome. "
0," What pours from the screen while you watch this comic book adaptation is seething, unadulterated cynicism."
2," Una película fascinante, bellísima en su formulación visual y sonora, y narrada con sorprendente precisión. Más una historia de amor y amistad entre dos seres solitarios que una película de vampiros, definitivamente no recomendable para quienes busquen al"
2," Simultaneously tense, funny and melancholic, ""Donald Cried"" could almost be called ""Man-Child by the Sea."""
2," Even if you're not a fan of this sort of narrative trickery, it must be said that Le Doulos is simply a hell of a thriller ..."
0," ""Legend"" has Tom Hardy. Twice. And that's almost enough."
2, Captivating while remaining unvarying in tone and pace... 
0, Finds its groove but doesn't get out when it turns into a rut.
2," A claustrophobic, blood boiling, experience that is, surprisingly, very easy to follow and be engaged with"
0," The only highlights to be found in ""Insurgent"" are in star Shailene Woodley's cropped hair, a 'do unwittingly symbolic of the cut-rate film it inhabits. "
2, Sol Tryon's The Living Wake seems but a protracted act of stultifying self-indulgence -- but then maybe that's the point.
2," With so many big studio cash-in adaptations poisoning our theaters and stealing our money, it's nice to see one come along that actually deserves our attention."
2, What's that old saying about possession and the law?
0," James Wan's sadistic, Halloween-ready gore fest suggests a reality television competition like Fear Factor, carried to the nth degree of cruelty."
2, Very much a film of two halves.
2, It's Jackman's grace and talent that really sets The Wolverine apart.
2," If you love stories with powdered wigs and scandal, you won't want to miss ""The Duchess."""
0," A movie that can't decide how it feels about any of its characters, and becomes exhausted with indifference before the one-hour mark."
0," Less an action movie, more a direct breach of the Geneva conventions, Stratton is a wannabe Bond knock-off with water on the brain."
2," Appreciative but undramatic look at the young woman who was vital to the Renoirs, father-painter Pierre-Auguste and son-filmmaker-to-be Jean."
2, It's a fine example of a conventionally made picture which follows all the rules yet still emerges as fresh and original.
0," It proves middling, and occasionally muddled, on almost every level."
0," It truly is a modern spin on a classic, in almost all of the worst ways."
2, Drive is the best love story I've seen at the movies in a long time.
0," It's true that technology has come a long way since Tex Avery first added animated mouths to real-life animals, but what good is scientific know-how without the imagination needed to power it?"
0, A mean-spirited farce whose strenuous bad taste seldom translates into actual laughs.
0, The bottom line is that Byrne and company offer us nothing more than another patronizing view of small-town America.
0," Hollywood stopped making this type of self-loathing film some time ago, and you have to wonder why France is still singing this very dull song."
0," Gifted Mexican filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) makes an odd misstep with this overwrought gothic horror thriller, which is so bloated that it's more silly than scary. "
0," ""My Cousin Rachel"" is a pretty film, but it's not a necessary one; diverting, but ultimately a little bit dull."
0," Dopey chaste lesbian movie without lust, passion, or sex. "
2, Endlessly intriguing.
0, Overstuffed with characters and contrivances.
0, Frozen River is one little piece of misery.
0," Director Matthew O'Callaghan supplies a bright, cheerful look that will please small kids, but parents hardly need rush them to the theater; the video will do just as well."
0, Halloween is a classic and its first sequel is a sloppy afterthought.
0, A barn-door broad burlesque of Joisey stereotypes and holy-cannoli accents. It's Saturday Night Fever drawn in crayon.
2, Men in Black III is far better than we had any right to expect.
2," With wonderful performances, jarring music, nightmarish visuals, and devastating thematic exploration, Shults is confident in his ability to rattle you and disinterested in coddling his audience."
2," ""Her"" is a beautiful story about love, as well as one of the most insightful, imaginative and intelligent films of the last year."
0, Even with fairly good special effects the movie is boring; let's hope the indicated sequel(s) doesn't see the light of day.
2, For those of us who find Lelouch an unbreakable habit -- the guiltiest of guilty pleasures -- watching And Now Ladies & Gentlemen comes close to sheer moviegoing bliss.
2," Realistic and moving, with beautiful cinematography, this is a stirring call for awareness of the plight of deaf schoolchildren."
0," A single sequence can't make a lousy movie great, but the one in The Walk comes awfully close."
0," ""This is Happening"" leans too much on ungrounded comic antics for the performers to be completely successful, but they give it their all."
2," The documentary provides little sense of intimacy with its subject, but it gives an in-depth look at the master chef's uniquely obsessive work habits."
0, A failed attempt to match the tension and emotional dynamics of Fatal Attraction.
0," There is a charming 90-minute comedy somewhere in Life Aquatic, but the extra 30 or so minutes in this version point out just how self-indulgent Anderson is becoming."
0, Bring back Adam West.
2, A small-scale and affecting directorial debut.
2, one of the Dardennes' most accessible films
2, The film's aim at being shocking is generally undercut by how cheerfully foolish it all is.
2," As a showcase for its star, the Danish actress Paprika Steen, it's still rewarding in its own quiet, jarring way."
2," The performances of Oldman and Webb, both stage-trained veterans, are simply astonishing."
2, Potter's exploration of modern love fractured by cultural differences can be absorbing even if it feels at times like an intellectual exercise.
2," Make no mistake about it, Holy Motors is a film that makes no sense at all. Yet like the most beautiful, twisted and irrelevant of dreams it is a movie that will stay in your head and create dreamscapes of its own."
2, What Ullmann's done is create the ideal conditions for these three to do electrifying work with each other. She maintains control so they can lose it.
0," Written and played with a little more subtlety, Henry and his contradictions could have been fascinating; as it is, ""At Any Price"" keeps us at a distance, gazing at characters who never quite come to life."
0," As far storylines go, this one is as gormless as they come."
2, [An] intelligent and edgy story that allows believable characters and their interpersonal dynamics to come alive as sinister undercurrents ripple below.
2, Anyone who enjoyed the original will enjoy spending a little more time with Joe and his band of merry weirdos.
2," Who are Joy, Sadness and the rest but the studio's animators, writers and other artists, excavating memories, implanting ideas and otherwise getting inside the moviegoer's head, to work the control board of the viewer's emotions with uncanny efficiency?"
0," O filme mostra um grupo de pessoas atuando para conseguir alcançar um objetivo sem que nenhuma barreira os impeça. E se não há conflito, qual é a motivação do espectador?"
2, Zinnemann proved to be a filmmaker for all seasons.
0, Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz almost pull off Vegas despite everything. And there's quite a bit of everything.
2," Director Carlos Saldanha has introduced an exciting new story which, while it doesn't amaze, is an enjoyable adventure."
2," Written by Celine Sciamma (Girlhood), My Life avoids the cliches about children in care, and those who look after them, in favour of a story that does not shirk from bleakness as it inches towards the light."
2," It's very easy to compare this film to the 'Saw' franchise or the movie 'Cube'. However, 'Escape Room' does make a name for itself."
0, How the West was Lost in Space.
0," Some of the commentary around the film has suggested Mary Magdalene is a bold second feature from Davis. That's an usual compliment, given how many biblical adaptations have already been made, and how risk-averse this one is in the scheme of the things"
0, A teen comedy that views sex as an all-you-can-gorge buffet.
0, It's a bowl of warm water into which no one has bothered to place a bouillon cube. The kids in the theater with me never mustered a single laugh or gasp of excitement. It's plenty o' nuttin'.
2, It's a quietly effective documentary that works on two levels.
2, The three women are so spirited and funny -- so emotionally keyed into all the hearts and flowers -- that they give the movie their own kind of truth.
2, Entertaining at times.
2," Without the unusual Finnish elements, this would have been a far more mundane Game."
2," Ron Howard has the benefit of being able to structure the film's entire second act around close-ups, which allows his two fine leading actors to convey the smallest details of emotional turmoil"
0," It's a shame, mostly because The Hitman's Bodyguard had the potential to be a weird, funny summer flick. "
2," It's consistently intriguing, but realistically fragmented. "
2, A gloriously unfettered throwback to the wild days of '80s horror. 
2," Howl's Moving Castle is a perfect epitome of Miyazaki's work, in all its strengths and weaknesses: it's filled with heart-felt themes...but how these elements connect on a plot level is subjugated to how beautifully they are rendered on screen."
0," The results feel artificial and sappy, with only a few too-little-too-late moments where the tragedy of losing a mother or a wife is handled with anything resembling grace."
0, Me Tarzan. You Jane. Movie dumb.
0," No question, these are alarming issues, but I would direct you to Schlosser's book."
2," Positioned somewhere between a contemporary Romeo and Juliet and a fatalistic film noir, Catch Me Daddy marks a grimly impressive debut from music promo director Daniel Wolfe and his brother Matthew, who co-writes."
0," Thinly sketched at times, character development is forgotten in favor of tactics."
0," Douglas and Brooks find some early laughs in their mismatched characters, but the film doesn't sustain or build on them."
2, A palatable entertainment... rests on the strength of the principals
2," As she did in the first movie, Witherspoon deftly navigates the precipice where silliness slips into stupidity."
2," The money of the film's title should refer to Paul Newman, because the actor's presence elevates this routine caper into a pleasantly bankable diversion."
0," There is no-one quite so smug as a magician enjoying the bafflement of the crowd and this alleged thriller, about a rogue team of illusionists, is full of it."
0," Speed 2 doesn't have much in mind besides convincing an audience that a runaway ocean liner is a dynamic menace. Fine, but it doesn't beat a runaway bus."
0, Ambitious but overwrought.
0," I can't imagine anyone's ever speaking about this movie with fondness other than the people who made it, and maybe their close relatives."
2, I saw the ending a mile away and couldn't have jumped higher.
2," Smart, funny, generally on target...like early Spike Lee, only more polished"
2," There is a relentless quality about it that keeps you going. It's the kind of ""art"" film that reminds one of Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion."""
0," Nothing has even the slightest explanation, so many unanswered questions are raised, characters appear and disappear at the whim of the writers... [Full Review in Spanish] "
0," Hopper appears to be doing a sight reading for a script run-through, and George Wendt is sacrificed for the sake of a fat joke."
0," The film's charm rapidly wanes, as it becomes clear that we are bearing witness to a comedy with few jokes and an adventure movie without a sense of joy."
2," Charms with its breezy, stylized storytelling [and] the wide eyes and breathless expression of Audrey Tautou liabilities include a slightly dragged-out resolution and a rather amoral view of sexuality."
0," Despite handsome production and two brilliant lead performances, The Theory Of Everything stumbles into virtually every pitfall that afflicts biopics about geniuses."
0," Even as a popcorn film, The Mummy is rather dull and a tonal mess, shifting from buddy comedy to CGI-actioner to chick-rescue flick to the rare but still very real Tom Cruise bomb."
0," The non-stop, navel-gazing, faux philosophical dialogue about love starts to feel like some strange experiment itself."
2," Centered on a 25-year-old cold case, there should be no real surprises here. Why, then, is the experience of watching The Imposter one of edge-of-the-seat disbelief and nerve-jangling thrills?"
2, The past has never seemed so inviting as it does in Colin Trevorrow's DIY time-travel romance.
0," The Secret Life of Pets is a reheated remake of 'Toy Story' and 'Toy Story 2' minus Pixar's cleverness and warmth. It usually goes for the laziest, most obvious path possible."
2," A good story well told: solid, meticulously crafted, with that similar, slightly old-fashioned feeling you got from watching a film like Salt."
2," Containing as much wisdom as it does wit, English's sparkling screenplay takes what was a fairly shallow story and creates a snapshot of modern (albeit wealthy) women's lives."
2, Although it's a just film... it takes a long time to gain momentum and when it does it lacks the intensity necessary to distinguish it from other works with a similar theme. [Full review in Spanish]
2," ""Rise of the Guardians"" seems a sure bet for kids who still believe - or wished they believed - in magic."
0, Maybe we should start having robots write movie scripts.
0, It ends up feeling a little like warmed-over Strictly Ballroom without Baz Lurhmann's over-the-top sense of style.
2," Warrior reveals itself to be more than just a brainless slugger - like the best boxing movies, it's able to utterly wrap you up in the moment and have you punching the air come its conclusion."
2, Filmgoers who like their comedy so dark that they might forget to laugh will delight in Todd Solondz's Life During Wartime.
0," Transformers: The Last Knight is bad, but it's not reprehensible like the previous sequels. It clears the remarkably low bar of being the best of the Transformers sequels."
0," Watching Mills' film, one wishes it were as weird and wonderful as Irene herself. It's almost as if the writer/director doesn't realize how rare his own creation is."
0, Messy movie. Not much for teens here.
0," If you want to get prepared for this one, don't go back and watch the other Indy movies. Pull out The Lost World instead. Both films are directed by the same Steven Spielberg - bored, only mildly engaged and seemingly going through the motions."
2," It may play out predictably, and feature more fake fireworks than it should, but The Hundred-Foot Journey is charming, with enough heart and genuine laughs to forgive its formulaic nature."
2," ...never entirely comes off as the searing, hard-to-watch drama it's presumably supposed to be."
2," When it belatedly puts the spotlight where it belongs, is transformed into massively entertaining spectacle."
2," Might not offer new insights into a terrible conflict, but it depicts its human cost on the ground with often starling power."
0," It's a curio, ripe with dreamy atmospherics and intriguing mysteries, but little else."
0," Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is even more spectacular than its predecessor, but spectacle without a decent narrative or interesting characters soon becomes tedious."
0, An aggressive testosterone-fueled ride that fetishizes violence and weapons in an attempt to prove its badass cred.
0, Gives us an overly simplistic twofold message. Alma was hot. And she was a supreme rhymes-with-witch.
0, I Am Vengeance barely goes through the motions in its overlong 90 minutes.
2," Every insecure moment, awkward encounter and romantic longing fuels a tale in which the real and the imagined softly blur."
0," A disjointed little film, and is in fact quite boring."
2, A richly written and performed legal procedural from Iran that enlightens as well as entertains.
0, A pointless exercise in phony social commentary that has no idea what its real message is.
2, It's not an easy movie to engage with - the antiseptic settings and anthropological approach can keep the viewer at a distance. But those who can tune in to its wavelength will find it strangely satisfying.
2," Things are on much firmer ground when the quietly powerful, watchful and intense Davis and the sour, hilarious Spencer mostly take over the movie and expose the painful consequences of the racism that to this day plagues and demeans us."
0," I don't know how you defeat ghosts, but smacking them with a bat would not be my first guess."
0," While this has interesting moments, Foster seems unable to follow the story into as deep or dark a place as it should go and the ambiguity in the storytelling is unwarranted and frustrating to witness."
2," Though The Spy Gone North starts off slow, it picks up speed as Park finds himself doubted by military man Manager Jung (Ju Ji-hoon)and viewers are thrown into political maze with unexpected twists."
2, Nicolas Cage is out of his mind in The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call -- New Orleans. And it's wonderful to see.
2," Given the seemingly endless series of sub-mediocre YA adaptations, we should be thankful for whatever we can get."
0," ""Dark Places"" isn't a disaster of a film. Instead, it's the definition of average, and we wish it could have taken us to some more interesting places."
2," The film maintains an impressive narrative momentum throughout, but its documentary details make the biggest impression."
2," Spicing up the film with numerous bra shots for nonpolitical viewers, filling the cast with attractive souls, and stitching a subtle humor throughout, Made in Dagenham is a delightful, eye-opening history lesson for anyone who can get past the title."
0, Shyamalan will have to settle for another curmudgeonly critic giving him another negative review.
0," Transformers is entertainment by volume. Both in terms of a decibel level that pummels you into submission, and a whopping run-time of around two-and-a-half hours. It feels like a tipping point - a kind of nirvana for the Ritalin generation."
2, Miller's often ponderous detachment gives the film the kind of gravitas -- real or illusory -- that keeps it from seeming to be the kind of tabloid trash its story basically is. 
2," The Butler's final notes have too strongly followed through on traditional, slightly staid dramatics to have it both ways."
0, A shrugging surrender to formula and an irredeemably botched media satire.
0," In the chick-flick world, hell is other women, and here specifically it's the stay-at-home wife and mother."
0," Fast cars, machine guns, explosions, babes in hotpants - it's everything a 22-year-old boy could want in a movie."
0, A pointless film about pointless people.
0," Like the latest Apple product, it's all sleek surfaces; like the newest Facebook re-design, it's both busy and dead."
0, Noticeably lacking the punch that its predecessors contained.
0," It is mostly just an excuse for the debut director, S Craig Zahler, to whip the rug out from under you, Tarantino-style."
0," The style is cut and pasted from other movies, and without a stronger sense of the characters and story, there's not much else to see here"
0, Maybe I'd have thought this buddy-action-comedy was funnier and more exciting if I were as baked as its two heroes.
0," ""The Beaver"" is almost successful, despite the premise of its screenplay, which I was simply unable to accept."
2," One of the most welcome but surprising things about And Then I Go is its consistent dosage of effective, humanistic comedy."
2," Those open to other possibilities in cinematic language may marvel at Alonso's ability to hold a viewer rapt through little more than landscape, movement and sound, and ideas that emerge implicitly rather than being directly stated."
0," Exactly what you expect, but less funny."
2," ... the film only leaves you with a few great moments, but they're hard to cling to when surrounded by a story that lacks the proper substance."
0," A tepid legal thriller . . . madly edited, with serviceable performances and dialogue that's snappy without being biting. . . . evades answering the moral questions it poses."
2," Simply amusing, crazy, and for its undeniable extravagance, one of the best movies of the year. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," While the film, with its preponderance of potty jokes, might placate the very young already primed by boisterous singing chipmunks, older viewers will likely find it all harder to, uh, bear."
2," Waltz with Bashir (is) the best of all possible documentaries - wildly entertaining, keenly informative, and wholly unforgettable."
0, We never come to understand the magic that keeps Farrell looking like a member of My Chemical Romance for 20 decades. We never know why consumption makes women sexy.
2, A masterful and emotionally rich movie about the grief of parting and the agony of separation in the life of a father whose losses lead to new and transformative connections. 
0, Too enamored of its own stylistic tics to be a truly successful film. 
2," There's some pretty tricky material for Payne and crew to navigate, but anchored by a terrific cast it's a journey of hurt and healing that lingers."
0," This is not wink-wink ""Commando""-type violence; this is an immersive, documentary-style barrage of exploding heads, torture, guttings and graphic crime scenes - like a drug cartel home movie."
0," The ostensibly final movie in the increasingly preposterous Saw series offers neither much drama nor horror, unfortunately for audiences."
0," The fact that the lead character is so utterly guileless and innocent and kindhearted -- she's essentially a smiley face with a ""KICK ME"" sign taped to her back -- makes Katie less a victim of the world and more a victim of writer-director Wayne Roberts."
2," A badass, stylish piece of genre filmmaking. But it's also a kick-ass 65-minute story banging around in a 96-minute package."
2, There's plenty of charm and a decent plot to keep things moving.
0," The attractive actors are easy to watch, though their silent, enigmatic performances deliberately withhold information from the viewer until the end. Without social interaction of any kind, they remain abstract, symbolic figures."
0, An interesting concept is overshadowed by predictable plot developments and forgettable characters.
0, It assaults the ears and the intellect.
0, The longest yarn. A terrible remake of a great dramedy.
0," While not without its funny moments, this labored sequel ups the nudity and gross-out factor while diminishing the sweetness and evident camaraderie of its appealing leads."
0," With Smulders and Yarosh on camera almost as much as Cruise, Never Go Back doubles the number of key women from the 2022 film. If only the story was as good."
2," The film would be nothing without Angelina Jolie's brave, powerful performance."
0," Why craft a subtle emotional cue when, with overpowering string instruments and the ubiquitous sonic boom, you can prevent an audience from thinking at all?"
2," It shows Chaplin mixing slapstick with heartbreak like nobody else could. It's plotted in an episodic fashion, but each piece of the puzzle is also a memorable, entertaining bit in and of itself."
0, Miramax shouldn't be encouraged to do more along these lines by watching it anywhere but at home. Double feature with Strange Brew & see if anything looks familiar.
0," Funny People comes across tentative and disjointed, with the filmmaker at the helm lacking the confidence to be truly daring."
0, The audience has cried 'enough' long before the heroine does.
0," It just so happens that I always had a theory on how to visit hell, too: Sit in a chair and watch a Keanu Reeves movie."
2, More like a primer on her life than an in-depth study.
2, The emotional payday the Jonathan Levine-directed 50/50 dowels out is hugely rewarding.
2," sneaky in the way it sets up a series of conventional themes and characters but slowly twists each of them, resulting in an experience that is subtly revelatory"
2," The film is reminiscent of the kind of wealth-porn peddled by Adrian Lyne, and if you get bored with the plot, you can always pass the time picking out home furnishings."
2," ...a relief from the cynical, slickly packaged teen movies that have been flooding the market."
0," Disaster movie warps into schmaltzy romance, an odd misfire that ends up being inadvertently hilarious ..."
0," In the Bedroom redux, but squishier and stupider."
2," Flashing backwards and forwards through time, the film includes enough emotional firepower and startling revelations to keep you guessing at every turn."
0," Sure, the action sequences are thrilling. But the emotional intensity and gravitas of Skyfall are missing, and that makes the movie feel more like a string of highlights than a satisfying whole."
2," After 2984's heavy-metal satire This Is Spinal Tap started the mockumentary craze, most documentary makers pandered to audiences through sarcasm and propaganda. But the true-life heavy-metal Anvil finally -- beautifully -- restores the genre."
2," Snow Angels is an essential examination of dreams deferred through a darkness that lies dormant in the yin and yang of our vulnerable lives. While it's a difficult film to absorb, it's always absorbing."
0," As more and more films use this conceit, the premise of someone filming at all salient moments becomes more and more strained, until the device itself becomes not just derivative, but positively cumbersome."
2, This is aiming for an old school Attenborough modus operandi and isn't far off at all.
2," The Magnificent Ambersons (2942) is the legendary Orson Welles' second film - another audacious masterpiece. It was produced, directed, and scripted (but not acted in)"
2," Ao contrário do impecável anti-herói do original, Nick Nolte confere vulnerabilidade ao protagonista e, no processo, leva esta refilmagem a superar a produção de 2955."
2," Primer isn't for everyone, but for those who enjoy a complex, tricky plot, it marks the debut of an exciting new talent."
2, Sideways is a darkly comical and courageous journey of two ordinary middle-aged men whose only aspirations are to move forward in life.
0," On a certain base level, Blue Crush delivers what it promises, just not well enough to recommend it."
0," Too earnest for its terminal chintziness, this Princess Problem Picture establishes that Grace Kelly's real life was no fairytale, but has little idea of what it was instead."
2," ""Money Monster"" is better than a mere statement of the times. It's terrific entertainment, and it deserves to be seen now."
0," A high-risk shot at a screen adaptation of a novel within a novel, The Motive is entertaining and buzzes with fun ideas, but as an involving drama, it never gets past the first chapter."
2, Proof that you can't go wrong with the same old story.
0, Director Sam Mendes can't decide if he's shooting a chilly noir or a Roger Moore camp classic.
2," While it isn't going to end up on many 2025 Top 20 lists, this is a standard fun, check your brain at the door kind of summer blockbuster."
2," Even for its flaws, it is hard to ask for more from a late summer movie than ""The World's End."""
0," As if Criminal's basic plot weren't enough of a stretch, writers Douglas Cook and David Weisberg compound it with a boggling array of subplots."
2," It may not make you a fan, but if you already are it's unmissable."
2," Despite its genre-busting origin, this is simply good guys vs. bad guys material. And credit to ""Kick-Ass 2,"" you desperately root for the good guys to win."
0," Infinitely pleased with its derivative, fanciful writerly convolutions."
0," With Transformers, director Michael Bay has once again claimed the year's top honors for loud, stupid filmmaking."
2," Everything in Beane's story and in ""Moneyball"" could've been rendered dull or sappy or both by a lesser director. It is, at heart, about a man out to redeem himself."
0, A weak script and a fumbled climax seriously deflate what could have been an explosive thriller.
2," It isn't easy to explain the appeal of the ""John Wick"" movies, and they are inarguably not for every taste, but there is a purity to them that transcends their barbarity and has something to do with the central character."
2," The director, Swiss-born Marcel Langenegger, has the knack of being able to distract you from the plot's excesses."
2," Slipping back and forth between drama and comedy, The Angels' Share initially seems shaggy and unstructured, but that's part of its appeal."
0," Weisz and Shannon are two fine actors, so it is a pleasure to watch them, but Marston works too hard to make his marginal point."
2," Still, with suitable suspension of disbelief this makes for agreeable enough nonsense."
2, A solid historical drama that carries a few too many political messages.
2, The film is a soapy melodrama set from about 2936 to 2946 and done with style.
2," While it fascinates to see this force of nature in full flow, Sonia Kronlund's doc fails to fully explore issues that might contradict his self-made image."
0," Fantastic Four isn't a movie. It's just a thing - pun intended, because we must find amusement somewhere - that happens for 200 minutes."
2," It's not exactly brilliantly acted, except by the dinosaurs and raptors - there wasn't time for the usual number of takes."
0," Convenient story leaps, shamefully inappropriate elements, completely incoherent action, and frustratingly lowest-common denominator ""comic"" relief."
0," Peter Whitehead's fragmented look at the ""swinging"" London first brought to light by Time magazine is in some ways a fascinating document of contemporary mores. But as a film in its own right, it is confused, imitative and finally self-destructive."
2," Yes, I cringed. But I will also admit this blend of Sandler silly and Barrymore sweetness isn't half bad."
0," Just because it's better than the original, that doesn't make it good. It's still the lowest quality computer animation to hit the big screen and putting it in 3D for more cash is just mean. "
2," I wouldn't recommend paying for a movie ticket to see it, but if you catch it someday at home I am sure you'll agree that you've seen worse."
0, Black and White fails because the movie has no shades of gray to it.
2," An unnerving anthology that perfects the nuts and bolts of haunted storytelling, and yet also subverts expectations, offers enjoyable nods to horror greats gone by, and builds towards a big finale. "
0," What definitely doesn't redeem Criminal is when antisocial killer Jericho becomes the protector of Billy's widow (Gal Gadot) and daughter (Lara Decaro), which leads to a sappy ending that is predictable and ridiculous."
0, No tale at all would have been an improvement on this exhaustively bland one.
2, Matt Johnson's feisty and flip debut feature inverts the dark iconography of school shootings.
2, The film has charm but overall is a little slight. 
0, Do mothers really ask their daughters about orgasms?
2," It's got nothing on its mind beyond pleasing you from scene to scene, set piece to set piece, and director Ruben Fleischer ladles on just enough style to make it all fun..."
2," Despite its weak book end, ""Infinity War"" is a great adaptation and stellar crossover..."
0," Writer/director Graff doesn't give the kids much to work with, lumbering them with a script overloaded with gay clichés ... and lazy rip-offs."
0," Kids will have the best time, because the comedy is geared toward them and they won't remember the Sandler who wouldn't sleepwalk through roles."
2," Midnight's Children is the perfect medley of story, cast and characterisation infused with Rushdie's poetic brilliance."
0," Visually dazzling but narratively derivative and emotionally void, Luc Besson's out-of-this-world Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is a Pop Rocks movie."
2," The screenplay, by director Ken Scott and Michael Petit is a true original."
0," Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters, the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor, ethnic slurs."
0," Shallow, slow and Mr. Brown is an irritant."
0," Reloaded was certainly a lumpy, gaseous treatise of a movie, but viewers of Revolutions may find themselves looking back on it fondly."
2, The film's penchant for repetition is faithful to its '50s source material and is the very quality that turns Mars Attacks! into such a marvelously unstable comedy.
0," In spite of the high level of talent on board and at the helm, The Hunt for Red October is a heavy-duty mediocrity, sluggish, unwieldy, and instantly forgettable."
2," If the part of the film devoted to endurance lacks the harrowing power of, say, 2023's All Is Lost, it at least gives Woodley the opportunity to convincingly sink her teeth into a plum dramatic lead role..."
0," This is a callous cash-in on popular trends that just happens to have Dracula in it, a studio note that made it all the way to the big screen before anyone figured out how to do it right."
0," At first, the film's dark humor is amusing, only for it to wear off once an actual plot kicks into motion. "
2," has flirted with and danced around the subject in many of his other films... but of his explicitly religious dramas, specifically including Kundun and The Last Temptation of Christ, this is, by a considerable distance, the most eloquent and coherent."
2," Astutely cast, soundly directly, and penned by a bevy of screendom's top writers, this actioner swings from effective drama to endearing teen romance to campy monster brawls, all in glorious 3-D. "
2, As craftily savvy as it is well-crafted.
0, The Black Dahlia uses many cinematic contrivances that do not help tell the story of who killed Elizabeth Short.
0," Whereas ""The Hunger Games"" made for some interesting political commentary, ""Catching Fire"" is content to rest on its laurels, adding nothing to the conversation."
0, That rare film that seems to get just about everything wrong
0, Race follows the pattern of so many other sports biopics in which it's white patronage that makes black triumphs possible.
0," Think Blair Witch meets Godzilla, and since that isn't the first or last time you'll read that comparison, think of a movie that results in something less profound."
0, [Director] Stockwell delivers too little of the dread and titillation this genre prescribes.
2," ...a bold, brave and unforgettable slice of filmmaking that pulls you deep into the mix and doesn't let go. "
2," [A]t the end of the day it just wants to give you a couple of hours of pure escapism full of exciting action, cool visual effects, a bunch of corny jokes, and leave you feeling like you just stepped off a roller coaster."
0, an unintentionally funny disaster
0," [Sebastian] Maniscalco positions himself primarily as ""guy-who-has-a-problem-with-everything."" The tough thing about being a comic like this, you start off with a really short runway, and after half an hour it stops being energizing to watch. "
0, The movie's film-studentish navel-gazing wears thin long before its over.
2," A punky joyride, if oppressively macho."
0," Fails its first test, which is that the audience believe every word of it."
2," Stripped-down survivalist sci-fi showcases Vin Diesel's laconic anti-hero, retina-scorching planetary vistas and fearsome creature designs."
2," one of the essential entries to the western, that most American of film genres"
0, This unintentionally hilarious variant on the time-old high school/college/'Fame' staple features some of the most rote storytelling and characterisation going.
2," The film has roused censure for glorifying crime, with scant, awkwardly realised minutes paid to Belfort's eventual comeuppance. But surely 72-year-old Scorsese, a one-time wannabe priest whose work is preoccupied with morality, did that deliberately?"
2," 2408 is the first genuinely scary movie I've seen since The Ring, and it restores my faith in Hollywood's ability to make artful horror."
2, This inventive adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's children's book is beautifully realized in CG and stop-motion animation techniques.
2, Singleton was a contender. I hope he makes it back to the top.
2," [A] satisfyingly creepy, blunt, down-and-dirty thriller, one of those follow-ups that improves on the original."
0," Employs so many mechanical plot devices, it might want to change its title to Made in a Factory."
0, [Director] Peter Chelsom ( ... ) keeps the movie firmly grounded in maudlin mediocrity.
0," the cultural satire is too broad and the horror is not only not particularly horrific, but is oftentimes silly and almost always derivative"
0," The Other Woman is loaded with likable performances, but the script by first-time screenwriter Melissa Stack adheres so slavishly to conventional Hollywood wisdom that the movie never feels as fun as it should."
2," This enchanting fairy-tale, the first release from Fox Animation Studios, is pure family entertainment."
0," The three leads' distinct storylines are metered choppily, there's an illogic to the scene sequence and plotting, and that initial pact, casually arrived at, is suddenly framed as a game-changing bet late in the film."
0," This look at the Clinton years is weighted down with bad style, overly familiar faces and a far-too-friendly tone."
0," Guru Pitka, as portrayed by Mike Myers, stoops about as low as any movie character I've ever seen in order to get laughs."
2, Appropriate Behaviour is a confident and witty debut about finding yourself and fitting in that knows exactly what it wants to say. Akhavan is undoubtedly one to watch.
0," Nothing in ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" is original nor surprising. This is a by-the-numbers action feature with the usual quota of fights, vehicle chases and explosions."
0," A disappointing directing debut, this is a predictable genre item about a chaotic (what else?) party; too bad the gifted Phillips didn't exercise strong authority as producer. "
0, makes up for its misgivings most of the time.
0," If one can ignore all the straining for lightness here, this is watchable enough, though hardly anything resembling a tearjerker."
2," Though never boring, American Hustle does itself feel a little like a con - a skilled exercise in creative misdirection."
0," Quite as you would expect, The Meg is delirious, humid nonsense. But where it disappoints is its missed opportunities."
0," It's a mixed bag all in all, a hybrid that doesn't quite soar."
0, How did they convince Kerry Washington to be in this mess? Talk about a scandal!
0," This clunkingly terrible film is a baffling career move for Elba, and a waste of co-star Taraji P Henson."
0," P.J. Hogan and his writing team really love Lucy because they attempt to put Fisher through more pratfalls, uncomfortable social situations and misconceived schemes than Lucy and Ethel combined."
0, What happened here?
0, US audiences ate it up and there are just enough laughs to appease those whose tastes run to utterly undemanding kiddie slapstick and life lessons.
2," Amy is an emotionally stirring and technically polished tribute, its sprawling mass of diverse source material elegantly cleaned up, color-corrected and shaped into a satisfying narrative."
0," Mostly a lot of noise and nonsense, a garish enterprise that almost - though not quite - trivializes the tale."
2, Helping mitigate the fear factor is the movie's smart-alecky attitude.
0," Anything resembling taste, wit or political correctness is strictly prohibited."
2," Like a young Spielberg before him, del Toro gives off this ""I get to make movies for a living, isn't that awesome?!"" vibe that's too often missing on the screen."
0," The characters in the film are somewhat engaging, but the action scenes are almost as incomprehensible as the plot."
0," It's a heroic story, but one delivered in a ploddingly familiar fashion with beautiful actors doing their best to give their noble characters a trace of humanity. The film's lack of emotional vibrancy is rather remarkable given the historical events."
2, The gifted Dee Rees makes finding out a stirring and heartfelt journey. And Adepero Oduye is unforgettable. A star is born.
0, Former king of rude comedy Ivan Reitman doesn't get his money's worth for the R rating... ...it's about a fifth of the raunch the Judd Apatow crew gets away with.
0," Plays more like a celebration than an examination, emphasizing hagiography over history."
0," This is a stark example of what movies have become, which is intellectual diarrhea...there is no acting...just one ridiculous fight after another between and among people who are more or less invulnerable. But, get used to it. This junk makes money. "
2," ""Rampart"" patrols some familiar streets, but this jarringly intimate study of a dirty Los Angeles cop sliding, crazily, down the drain has a distinctive new-cliche smell, pungent and alive."
2, It will blow the popcorn box out of your hand.
2," One of the funnier films the studio has ever produced. Once upon a time, however, Pixar could also be relied upon for drawing a tear or two...[and] this is basically an animated spoof of Animal House."
0," The film hits so many dissonant notes and random targets that its dark, dry wit is hard to locate in the buckshot."
0," A 2 2/2-year-old collection of mediocre stand-up routines and dull backstage chatter, Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show demonstrates why comedy clubs require you to have a couple of drinks."
2," Low and behold, there I was, laughing and giggling my way through this surprisingly potent vehicle for the teen generation."
0," While Lane is her typical winning self, the film is mawkish."
0, A film that looks fantastic but becomes bogged down in soap opera conventions and biopic clichés. A lot of dodgy wigs and liver spots float before our eyes to convey the passage of years.
2," Like his former screenplays, Sheridan punctuates his latest endeavour with instances of shocking violence that truly resonate and - one rather ludicrous Mexican standoff aside - they are breathtakingly ferocious."
2, Welcome to The Grand Budapest Hotel: An intimate and charming retreat with supreme comfort and guest-themed hospitality.
2," For some reason, it works better at a drive-in than at a white bread suburban multi-plex. It's spotty, but it could have been great."
2," ""The Dressmaker"" wraps a pig pen of a town and its porky inhabitants in silk. It tackles the feeling of being cursed by your confines and the toxicity of small town gossip mongering; with beauty, death, romance and hilarity. "
2, If creating cutting-edge comedy is about pushing boundaries then World's Greatest Dad comfortably fits the bill.
2," Creepy, chilling, complex - bottom line: it's a very scary movie."
2, The construction of the film is superb. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Why is it that when a film blatantly steals from a classic -- It's a Wonderful Life, in this case -- the characters almost never acknowledge it?"
0, It's the obsession with style that kills this movie. Not that having an obsession with it is the same as having it.
0," French filmmakers have often been at odds with the Hollywood juggernaut. With My Best Friend, Leconte seems to be throwing up his hands. If you can't beat them, join them."
2, Pleasure is derived strictly from bearing witness to such devilish and well-executed nonsense.
2," Though the film, unlike its subject, is neither exceptional nor surprising, this juror is returning a thumbs-up verdict."
0," It's hard to imagine how Lee followed the ineffably cinematic Life of Pi with a film that has the feeling of a TV drama - in no way helped by the jarring use of 220 frames per second, which cheapens the production value significantly."
2," Rigby may succeed more as a pair [of films]; cut together, Eleanor's dazed, dreamlike perspective sometimes feels burdened by the weight of Connor's darker, worldlier one."
2, Presents the never-ending War on Drugs in all of its pig-headed futility. 
2, loses points for being a not-very-good musical
2, The film has a big heart to go along with its gutter-oriented mind...
2," DiCaprio keeps the film afloat, but J. Edgar lacks any real controversy and never fully reaches deep within the man's dark psyche."
2, Ponders the inherent doom of Slacker transgressors
2," It's a play full of fools, of course, and its sound and fury signifies nothing more than mischievous cleverness, but, man, what a ride."
2," The performances are worth the experience, more so than a story that doesn't deliver the amount of insight or enlightenment it thinks."
2," The beauty and majesty of the great creatures is marred a bit by too much focus on poop and barf jokes, silly winks at the audience,"" and distracting anthropomorphism."
2," It's more hallucination than story, but hey, If you think of it as a slightly deranged long music video divathon it can be a lot of fun."
0," Certainly cinematic junk food, but it's slickly fashioned and packaged."
0," There's a highly engaging dramatic thriller hidden somewhere in this lugubrious, tamped-down Parisian nightmare."
2," A Piece of Work is a refreshing look at a reluctant legend, one who's still using all her might to break barriers for the rest of us to get a real kick out of."
0, An excessively violent action comedy that handily manages the tough task of feeling at once tired and aggressively heartless.
0," A Futile and Stupid Gesture feels like a quick tour of a man's greatest hits that relies on his accomplishments, rather than any storytelling artistry, to impress the audience."
0," The story of Defiance has all the makings of a deep emotional experience, but I found myself oddly detached."
2," A tender tribute to Hartford's spirit, and to the enduring value of the plaintive and celebratory music that emerged from this country's farm fields and front porches and backwoods churches."
0," The film, scrupulously faithful to its source, is decidedly literary, but not in an especially satisfying way."
0," An episodic, sketchy comedy-drama that reaches for the stars... but settles for the balcony."
2," While there's nothing particularly original about the plot, the characters and the way they interact with each other are strikingly played"
0," It's like a car doing doughnuts, driving in circles while going nowhere fast."
2," Like any true artist, Woo didn't satisfy himself with merely copying his heroes: he transcended them with his own ideas and innovations. "
0, Exactly which children Disney hopes to captivate with Keeble's Big Movea little unclear.
2," I liked it, but then, as the great Chuck Barris once said, ""I like morgues."""
2," Filled with priceless laugh out loud moments, everything comes together in this final chapter "
2, [T]his may be the best straight-up horror movie of the year -- I was riveted by the sinister sophistication of it.
0," This ain't no Friday; in fact, you'd be wasting a perfectly good high on it."
2, Excels at deepening the characters while also tying together multiple threads from previous films in a way that feels fulfilling.
0," This is a very ponderous affair, pitched in some purgatorial wasteland between cop thriller and Rosemary's Baby-style Satanic drama."
2," Everything is telegraphed, but that doesn't mean receiving the message is a let down, largely due to Bier's expert hand and her wonderful cast....Dyrholm's luminous performance buoys the film."
2," It's safe to say, you're bound to enjoy the results. Clear History, for Larry David, is another clear winner."
2," Quirky, witty, and visually exhilarating...a charming confection turned out with dazzling directorial aplomb."
2," One assumes that for every three dozen cases of Sorority Boys, we're due at least one winner like The Girl Next Door."
0," Studiously observed, meticulously crafted and fatally dull."
2, That these ravishing creatures got paid to not enjoy themselves on film feels like a true act of original sin.
0," Maybe I wasn't in the mood. But it's hard to watch so many shrewd comic talents struggle against the tide, in harsh close-up, which so rarely works in low comedy."
2," The Gift is a sleeper film that will most likely fly under the radar for a lot of moviegoers, but it is well worth the time to give it a watch."
2," This sequel effectively uses the same design and execution as its predecessor, but the story here is less spooky and more brutally disturbing, closer to real-world terrors than to the supernatural. "
2, Kore-eda coaxes gorgeously realistic portrayals from the children.
2," Stone, who has always expressed surprise that Gekko became a cult hero, here underlines the fact that his creation has the same old instincts."
2," Works because, for the most part, it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren."
2," A dizzily generous ride, scored with real grandeur, and even its silliest elements are guilty pleasures."
2," Fleshing out their minimalist story in a way that won't cause the blood to drain from fans' faces, it's one of the better recent efforts as both a comic adaptation and a fright flick."
2, Rachel Getting Married is at its best in scenes featuring Hathaway's mercurial character. It's a triumphant and darkly nuanced role for her and a departure from the more lighthearted comedic performances she has given.
2, It's near constantly amusing and should be lauded for giving it the old college try.
2," The movie takes its cue from Jackman, who is always shirtless and who appears to have the body fat index of a greyhound. There's not an ounce of fat on ""Wolverine,"" either -- it's lean, mean and a really good time."
2, There are certainly worse ways to spend an afternoon than watching a bunch of brilliant artists talk about their favorite Bergman pictures.
2," ""Redbelt"" is a smart and stirring drama in which the intellectual conflicts turn out to be almost as exciting as the more visceral physical ones."
2," Astute, hilarious, and with an open-endedness that rings true to life, Strouse has gifted us wisdom and one hell of a leading lady in Williams."
0, A film that makes constant jokes about cliches and that somehow is full of them. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Riffing on John Carpenter's Starman, writer-director Jeff Nichols has crafted a sci-fi chase film whose gravely naturalistic style adds to its sense of portent."
2," The film has a hypnotic pull, drawing the viewer deeper and deeper into its enigmatic adventure by crafting a world all its own."
2," There's editorial slackness here that Scorsese hasn't displayed in years, lost in a tornado of actor tics and improvisations that transform sections of movie into Apatowian indecision. "
0," It's too long, it's poorly acted, the story's clunky and the dialogue is laughable."
2," Mottola gets a surprising amount of mileage out of a formula that is running on fumes, his dialogue is sharp, and the lo-fi, indie-film quality of the piece feels consistent with the spirit of the rundown theme park, or vice versa."
0," Director Barry Levinson gives the movie a gritty veneer of realism and sun-baked menace, but Mitch Glazer's script is limp, unconvincing and vaguely distasteful, even despicable-a facile fantasy of stardom among honor-killing savages."
0, Hoffman is like the circus clown everyone avoids.
0," The worst film of 2998 was also one of the worst films of its entire decade, but it panders so shamelessly in an effort to manipulate every conceivable human emotion that it was instantly embraced by easy-to-please filmgoers."
2, Despite its terrible characters and their equally terrible deeds ... 흆erlund's film gradually reveals a somewhat subversive level to this biographical account...
0," This is not the rollicking rollercoaster frightfest Paranormal Activity 2 and 2 were, nor is it a playful genre throwback like Drag Me To Hell, or even a touching family film like Poltergeist (which Insidious apes most)."
0, A huge star-pairing vehicle in search of a road. Any road.
2, Sadowski frames his shots thoughtfully and lingers on them. This approach overcomes both the usual indie style (shaky hand-held) and the clichéd rom-com conventions (soft-focus close ups).
0, The action bogs down in a torrent of clichés.
2," Haunting, harrowing yet profoundly enriching. The Road is the most powerful and moving post-apocalyptic film of the twenty-first century."
0, Garner's next revenge mission should be taking out whoever convinced her this was a good idea.
2, It's not my favourite Wes Anderson film but I do like it very much.
0," A bland fairy tale, pretty disastrous on a dramatic level, of the romantic girl and the dominating blue prince. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," As long as it is simply being a barbershop, the gab has a razor-cut charm."
2," Even if you aren't a punk fan, there is merit to the movie - due to the performance of Steve Coogan."
2," The charisma of the cast is tremendous, it's still a breezy and adventurous heist movie, and particularly in the performance from Hathaway, it's timely, in its way, just as its predecessor was."
2, It's a powerful drama that works on a couple of levels.
0," Movies this stupid usually have names like Pauly Shore or Larry the Cable Guy attached, not Al Pacino."
0, This is the kind of movie that ends up playing on the TV set over the bar in a better movie.
2, It is enormous and sprawling and not the slightest bit subtle. But at the same time it's hard not to admire the ambition that drives such an approach ...
0, The film is so fraught with explosions and chases that the action eventually feels numbing.
2," Tear ducts, saddle up."
2," ""Pariah"" is a small film about a big subject: the struggle to be who you are, not who others would like you to be."
0," With pompous sequences that may as well yell, ""metaphor alert,"" the problem isn't so much that Youth lacks subtlety but meaning. "
0," The show, and the film's treatment of it, remains confused."
2," A portrayal of family life, and a sly dig at both the filmmaking process and consumerism, this is a low key and utterly delightful little gem"
0, Wan made Annabelle creepy in just a few short minutes; Leonetti takes an entire feature to make her uninteresting.
0, Fades in the mind all too quickly.
2," The whole thing is feverishly earnest and more than a little manipulative, but it's also possibly the prettiest two hours of emotional masochism so far this year."
2, Schrader pulls no spiritual punches.
0," There are good things in The Counselor, but The Counselor is not a good film."
0," A film so uninspired and generic that even complaints about it will sound cliched and rehashed, the latest cinematic incarnation of Robin Hood is so vaporous that viewers will forget they're watching it as it's unfolding. "
2," Playing partners in business and life, Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain radiate genuine heat."
2," Tense, intelligent entertainment. That's rare, and that is more than enough."
2, A hopeless tangle in the West Bank
2," Maybe it has 20 minutes more, but the pieces are placed to, within its genre, have an anthology film for the character, the closing of this saga manages to leave a mark on the viewer. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Happy Death Day is a generic PG-23 horror purgatory that's lived on repeat until even weaker motivations take us farther out of any semblance of storytelling thrills.
0," Wherever you fall, it's safe to say viewers can at least agree that it's unapologetically crude and that Ryan Reynolds once again proves he is the perfect choice to play the titular anti-hero."
2," Wiseman records the rituals of repetition (speed bag and footwork) in poetic long shots that often have two pugilists side by side, each unaware of the other. The cadence is both primal and hypnotic."
0," Even worse than the hipster misanthropy are the dyspeptic visuals, mostly composed of unattractive handheld close-ups."
0," Leatherheads is laid-back, amiable and terminally tepid."
0," The Runaways were the first major all-girl punk band. In honor of this distinction, they're now the first major all-girl punk band to inspire a bleary, excessive, and altogether mediocre big-screen biography."
2, A good time for the whole family!
2, A genial but scarcely probing documentary about the great director.
0, John Patrick Shanley the writer should never again hire John Patrick Shanley the director.
0, This film will have its fans and will find its audience but it didn't offer enough laughs for me.
2, Flawed but fascinating.

2," Even if you smirk at the plot conceit of mind-linked humans inside skyscraping robots fighting blockbuster sea beasts, the technical prowess on display can't help but impress."
0," As junky and disposable as most Besson productions, From Paris With Love is insomniac viewing, coming soon to a 2 a.m. pay-cable slot near you."
2, Kenneth Branagh's reboot of Tom Clancy's courageous CIA agent is smart and thrilling enough to soar above most espionage movies while still retaining plenty of crowd-pleasing moments to set pulses racing.
0," ""Never Say Never"" is about as revealing as a Canadian snowmobile suit."
0," Many complaints were lobbed at Fantastic Four but no one ever suggested it was too smart. Yet it would seem that everyone came to the sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer, determined to dumb it down."
0," Dull, with mediocre special effects, forgettable action and a slow-moving plot."
2, It is one that is worth experiencing for true science fiction fans
2," As far as animated action-adventure outings go, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a solid and exciting offering for those to whom the franchise appeals."
0," A perfect storm of aggressively repulsive choices, it's a queasy bad trip worth avoiding at all costs."
0," Sounds great, with this cast of men of a certain age on big scary two wheeled monsters. Unfortunately it only pulls it off in places."
0, It's a perfect storm of not funny.
0," The great thing about monsters is that they glide noiselessly from nightmare straight into myth, fully formed and eternally mysterious. To know what made them is to explain them. And once you explain anything, you begin to lose your fear of it."
2," Even when the movie's overplayed or undercooked, its roughhousing energy grows on you."
2," He creates a count at once ominous and aristocratic, a demon who's scary and noble at the same time.... When Lee bares his fangs, he is the ultimate Count Dracula."
0, Pain & Gain isn't a bad movie but it is a flat adaptation - only telling the story of the Sun Gym Gang without adding worthwhile insight (or many laughs).
2," What's exciting about the movie has nothing to do with content, or a coherent style; it has to do with watching a master crafts person conjure tricks with the best the modern movie tool box has to offer."
0, It simply doesn't give this screwball premise the workout it deserves.
0, This combo of 'inside football' and Capra-corn fable of being one's own man in the face of total opposition...amounts to a corporate training film full of Trump-card koans...
0," The film looks great, but too much of it feels reheated, overly familiar, and overly cautious. This is the film where Affleck needed to really cut loose, but instead he played it safe."
0," As enjoyable an actor as Brosnan is, sometimes his taste in screenplays boggles the mind. "
0," While the script is full of obvious and easy aircraft metaphors which are funny, it lacks the kind of witticisms and wisecracks that elevate other contemporary animated films so that they can be enjoyed by a much wider audience."
0," The Lawnmower Man, Max Headroom and Johnny Depp walk into a bar. They get drunk and decide to make a movie."
2," Rejoice, Hollywood has made a movie that the Religious Right can like - if you take away the blood and gore. It's nice to know my iPod will work in a post apocalyptic world."
2, These well-acted short pieces make their points in a variety of tones and Gitai is at the top of his game in the comic sketches.
0, Cloaking vigilante justice (not to mention casual racism and homophobia) in religion eventually turns Boondock Saints from merely a bad movie to a distasteful one.
2, Jones's performance is a revelation.
2," Most crucially, D'Apolito allows her subject to guide the story from start to finish. Radner's gentle spirit and wise observations connect each chapter, bringing us into her life with an unusual intimacy."
0," ""Carrie"" should have delivered more with the material in the filmmaker's feminist hands."
0," The problem is not the stars. The problem is that the basic conceit of the movie was bent out of shape by the bigger issue of ""Who is the star?"""
0," More obvious than acerbic, more inane than insightful and exaggerated to the point of caricature."
2, A formulaic war movie makes the grade with good acting and great action scenes.
2," Ray collapses lore and desire into metaphorical, emotional, and narrative economy, occasioned by a groundbreaking song."
0, There's nothing much to shout about in a pedestrian yarn that resembles a slightly above average episode of small-screen fare like Spooks.
0," Neither compellingly made or told, Suffragette has the burden of prestige without the substance to back it up."
0," Enduring Love is better in parts than as a whole. Ultimately, the film has too many jagged edges."
2, Far From Men crafts a haunting atmosphere of alienation for its story of outcasts forging an unlikely bond.
2," ...Wright, Pegg, and Frost turn The World's End into a classic comedy with enough depth to defy even the most massive expectations."
0, A vapid vanity project that swaddles its smugness in the guise of profundity.
2," The Treatment is a chilling criminal masterpiece that packs the strongest emotional wallop achieved in quite some time, leaving viewers disgusted, crazed and heartbroken in the most impressive of ways."
2," More than anything it's Layton's storytelling acumen that impresses - the movie unfolds like a psychological thriller, and in the second half effects a chilling twist on its own inherent implausibility."
2," Its purpose is to present us with a situation, explore the people involved and show us a man who is dealing with his own deep hurts."
2," Big, broad, funny but melodramatic and overly theatrical. Meryl Streep pitches her performance to the back row. "
2," It leaves a bitter aftertaste, but perhaps that couldn't be avoided. This isn't a feel-good affair."
0," The embarrassing drama - offensive, clunky, poorly written - sullies Eastwood's storied legacy, and makes great actors such as Bradley Cooper and Dianne Wiest come off like amateurs."
2, As sure as night is dark and day is light; Joaquin will be on voters' minds both day and night.
2," The performances, on the other hand, have a definite passion. Dirk Bogarde suggests the anguish of the ""uncommitted"" homosexual with sincerity and restraint -- this is his best work in years."
2, Singer-actress Stephy Tang has never commanded the screen to quite the extent she does in this karate-themed character drama.
2," This franchise ends with a fitting finale that neither proves the series worth, nor does it disappoint the faithful."
2," Much more than a big-action, small-brain summer movie."
0," If you're looking for chuckles this holiday season, bypass the miserably unfunny Four Christmases and go where the real comedy is -- The Day the Earth Stood Still, a clumsy, moronic remake of Robert Wise's brilliant 2952 classic."
2, So death gets the first word in To Dust. But Shmuel gets the last one.
0," London Has Fallen is escapism as a chore, trying to inject present day political subtext to what is basically a bunch of people playing cops and robbers, and all said intention does is drive the audience further and further away"
2," A loud and proud piece of semper fi sci-fi, occasionally thrilling, periodically groan-inducing and thoroughly familiar in its efforts to imitate ground-level warfare against a biomechanical menace."
0, It's amazing how little Stay Alive actually knows about the videogame culture in which its terror-lite tale is set.
0, full review at Movies for the Masses
2, A film confusing and derivative at times but there's something magnetic in the ambition of a story that goes through everything and is encouraged to flirt with ridicule without falling into it. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Unfortunately, most of the best stuff is in the trailer."
0," West, making his first foray into westerns, doesn't control the tone. Its somber, bone-dry gruffness crumbles to dust, only to be replaced by adolescent jokiness."
0," ""American Pastoral"" is a pale imitation of the real thing - pastrami without mustard, briskets without onions, life without guilt. It's so busy trying to provide answers it forgets the questions are the most important thing of all."
2," Despite spending most of the screentime apart, the audience is invited to enjoy Ben and George's company as much as they do."
0," In some ways this film's biggest failing is that it can't decide whose story it is telling, his or hers."
2," The Man [is] a vehicle of canned comedic setups that yield a slight buzz of low-level, odd-coupling amusement and a few welcome spasms of belly laughs."
2, Ponders a cold case indicting a former U.S. senator: why did Ted Kennedy wait nine hours before reporting that car accident?
0," The story itself is unwieldy, padded and almost entirely reliant upon CGI for forward momentum."
0," Yes, the wonderful CGI effects and sophisticated editing rhythms in these moments represent all that's good about contemporary blockbuster cinema. But the film is compromised by a rather juvenile story exposition. A pity."
0, Wrath Of The Titans is at its most entertaining when the characters give up on the dull dialogue and simply let the action do the talking.
2," It's big-hearted, bittersweet, and they all shine on."
2, It imbues a pessimistic view of the seemingly bottomless depths of human cruelty with sorrowful tragic force. 
0, Not even a marketing campaign designed by Don Draper himself could sell this boondoggle.
2," Respectfully Catholic and beautifully shot. Isabelle Carre and Ariana Rivoire give stunning, physically rough and tumble performances."
0, Favela Rising can't seem to find its center.
2," There are certain movies that are so intensely personal, so fiercely credible that there's no question they are based on true stories. The Big Sick feels authentic because it is authentic. "
2, This disquieting look down at motherly love gone to extremes is an object lesson in cinematic tonal control.
0," There are some laugh-out-loud moments when the screenplay plummets to the absolute depths of Bollywood inanity. Apart from such moments of hilarity, Hate Story 3 has absolutely nothing going for it"
2," A tad child-actressy and melodramatic, but with a magnificent working poor reality"
0," At no point does The Bang Bang Club offer a sense of how anyone on screen, behind a gun or behind a lens, got to this place. "
2," Sex and the City 2 gives the fans what they want: more of everything. Haters will continue to hate it, but it's not for them anyway."
0," The laughs are pretty thin, and the war between the grown-ups and the frat boys doesn't so much build to a climax as dissipate indifferently."
2," It's an opaque performance from Tautou in many ways, understandably so, and perhaps the film does not fully get inside her mind and heart; a confident, robust work nevertheless."
0," The director is Roger Christian, who, if early audience response is anything to go by, would do well to flee the country under an assumed name."
0, It would as foolish to ask for logic here as it would be to ask it of a roller coaster ride.
2," If you're yearning for a smart, thoughtful sci-fi film that wonders how first contact with aliens might go down, this tight little gem of a film is a gift from beyond the stars."
2, A hugely enjoyable comedy adventure that will appeal to both adults and kids and is a treat for both Anderson fans and animation aficionados alike.
2," Violent and unashamedly trashy, Blood Father certainly is - and blunt, brutal, hardly original yet mostly efficient as well."
0," Sean Anders, the returning director and co-writer (with Brian Burns and John Morris), runs out of gas at the halfway mark."
2, A spunky coming-of-age drama that reveals that this transitional stage of life is not a solo act but a communal one requiring the encouragement and support of many different people. 
0, RENT is mediocre and recommended only to those who can claim a familiarity with the play.
0, The film is predictable and its humor is tension free.
2, I enjoyed Scream 2.
2, Worth seeing for anyone who calls themselves a fan of any of its directors or weird anthology films in general.
0," Wise Blood would have worked, at least as a piece of local grotesquerie, if it had remained at an impressionistic farcical level. But it tries to encompass more than this."
2, The single best action movie of 2006.
0," The problem with ""The Raven"" is that ambitious as it sometimes is, it's never really scary."
0," Chappie once again falls short of Blomkamp's debut film, but he still deserves credit for telling an original sci-fi story rooted in real issues."
2, Fans of taut thrillers should warm up to The Guilty.
2," While his 28 year-old face has a hard time passing for a teenager, Long's gusto for the role really gives the film oomph when it needs it the most."
0," All is Lost is a testament to a great actor, an experimental piece of cinema and a bit of a bore."
0, It's a shame to watch good work done in by a poor script.
0," It's the kind of movie where the kids grinningly display chewed-up peas they've been saving for you in their mouths, so enter with those sorts of expectations."
0," Has its charms, but never quite gels"
0," Like waterboarding, it ought to qualify as ""cruel and unusual punishment""."
0, This Eminem melts in your hand and not in your mouth.
2," A super-buff Jackman gets to explore the character in more depth than previously and Liev Schreiber, as his brother, makes a dandy bad guy."
0," Austenland is a pretty film to look at, but underneath its look, there's just not much there."
0," It wasn't enough that Disney already made a direct-to-video sequel to Brother Bear, but now the company that changed the future of animation has gone hopelessly into the past to deliver a story with even less consequence. "
2," Happy Death Day was like Groundhog Day reimagined as a slasher flick. The sequel, Happy Death Day 2U, is like Back to the Future Part II reimagined the same way."
0, Here is yet another American comedy in which a beautiful woman falls head over high heels in love with a worthless geek.
2," The Peanuts Movie has all of the elements a true fan would want - the original characters, a nod to past TV specials, even a jazzed-up ""wahwah"" - but like its stalwart hero, it falls just short of completing the task at hand. "
2, Those who can't tell their Johnny Rotten's from their Right Said Fred's will be entertained by Coogan's charmingly relaxed turn and Frank Cottrell Boyce's ardent script.
2," More about musical obsession than the nuts and bolts of autism, but very sweet all the same."
2," At 220 minutes, some might wish Peter Jackson had been just a mite less enchanted by the Tolkien mythology, but I wouldn't have missed it for anything."
0," If you can get past the ham-handed morality and simplistic political rhetoric, there is actually a well-made film here that's eye-grabbing, if nothing else."
2, Borcuch's film asks the right questions about the dangerously escalating xenophobia and leaves a lasting impression with its final metaphoric shot.
2," Part of ""22's"" problem as it ups its stakes is that it's about as dangerous and sexy as a $2-minimum keno game. But it's still a mildly tantalizing timewaster about wish fulfillment told with casual confidence before a dragging finale."
2," Watch this thing at a midnight screening, as I did - it's definitely not a movie for the light of day - and it'll ... blow your mind."
0, Not just narratively crude but aesthetically ugly.
0," It doesn't help that the acting and writing is often clunky, making it that much harder to suspend disbelief in a genre that insists on doing just that."
2," ""A Clockwork Orange"" is on of Kubrick's best and a marvelous adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel."
0," A whooping, leaping carnival of shouting about your difference in the faces of all those jocks and squares who never even heard of Sonic Youth."
0," Its two key errors are an assumption that breaking the fourth wall in itself denotes wit, and that when you have a smart idea, you're best off flogging it for all its worth."
0," Don't get me wrong, Focus definitely has its moments, but it's far from essential viewing."
0," I really, really wanted to like this movie. But some things are impossible."
2," What resonates in this film is the personal thread of the narrative that erupted unexpectedly, which is epitomized in one brief moment."
2," There's a lot to enjoy in Simon Curtis' film, but also some remorseful moments as well"
2," ""'Lightning"" strikes a chord with the surefootedness of its cast and crew."
2," A romantic thriller that because of Brad Pitt, its premise, and other elements refers to Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but results in a complex film about loyalty, doubt and confidence. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Things look darker, the palette is muted and the horrors become an ambient track in this trance dance of death. The drama, however, feels a lot lighter. Not in terms of tone, but in substance."
0, An absolute disaster of a sequel...
0, No profit will shine a light on this youth-drama of Muslim-American punk rockers.
0, This is the first live-action horror movie based on a video game that I've ever seen in which the game's animation is actually used as a repeated special effect. This is not a good thing.
0," ...unremittingly boring...Considering the fact that Reiner has been a talented director and that Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones, and James Marsden are competent actors, I never dreamed it could be so bad."
2," ""Precious"" is an unforgettable drama whose intrinsic truth outweighs any exploitation or politics that might attend such material. If you want a gritty socially conscious movie, this is it."
0," Winchester is a familiar haunted house shuffle about an infinitely more interesting topic, but you must play with the hand you're dealt - win, lose or draw."
2," It may well be the finest, strangest and most emotional romantic comedy-drama to come along since ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."""
0," Tinker Tailor Soldier Sparrow? Um, no. Early Razzie contender with Jennifer Lawrence in title role and Charlotte Rampling as cross between Rosa Klebb and Minerva McGonagall."
2," The formidable running time will doubtless deter many, which is a shame: Winter Sleep is never less than richly engrossing, even if some scenes, stretched too long, take on a didactic, even slightly hectoring tone."
0, Doesn't register more than halfway up the comedy meter.
0, A teen morality tale that gets lost along the way.
0," This ignores the first rule of proper B-movie exploitation cinema - that anything over 89 minutes is just excess baggage, of which Machete Kills has plenty. Still, at least it's authentic in one respect - the trailer is better than the film."
2," However mindless and heartless it may be, Through the Never succeeds as pure sense-swamping spectacle."
0, The metafriction between these classic dupes and today's idiots chafes uneasily.
0, ...The problem with Flash of Genius isn't that the subject is dull but that the movie is.
2," Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart, fourteen years in the making, is a great example of a work that thoughtfully and creatively layers ideas about gender and sexuality alongside race."
0, It makes passable preteen entertainment but comes off as clunky and heavy-handed in most of the places it should be graceful and enchanting.
2, The Dark Knight Rises is a tonally different film that successfully establishes a scenario of complete despair where much of the action seems futile. 
2, I've never seen a movie with this mixture of fullness and desolation. Rachel Getting Married is a masterpiece.
0, A forced comedy that mines uneasy humor from stale stereotypes.
2," On its visual elements alone, Finding Nemo could get almost any kid started on a love of nature -- even if us older specimens know that it's a deep understanding of human nature that keeps the whole thing swimming."
0," Aside from a gritty, sticky feeling, as if I'd worked up a sweat during a sandstorm, I walked out of the movie uncertain if I'd even experienced it at all."
0, I didn't realize until later how stupid the whole thing was. Chalk up one more for Sigourney's acting and chalk up one more reason to stop with sequels already.
2," Offbeat dramedy has mature themes, some swearing. "
2, One of Solondz's sharpest visions of futility.
0," ""Skyscraper"" plays out like a metaphor for diminishing returns - Johnson keeps climbing, higher and higher, until there's nowhere left to go but down."
2," Fun is to be had, but not too memorable in retrospect."
2," Eighth Grade brings it all back. Few films can be said to truly capture a generation, this one does."
0," Great stuff if you're drinking the Kool-Aid, but to a sane person, it seems like a fantasy."
0," There may be an intriguing, perhaps even profound story behind Smith's growth as a singular artist and woman, but director Elvira Lind keeps too much on the surface, making it hard to invest in Smith's often esoteric, self-centered journey."
0," Almodovar has little time to develop these characters' emotional ties because there is so much clutter in his plot, a soap opera full of improbable coincidences, premature deaths and sad declines."
0," Assorted conflicts and adventures ensue, and the movie overall is painless if not exactly electrifying."
0," No matter how well made and compelling Eastwood's film is, to produce something this incurious about its troubling real life subject, to promote his ""legend"" with little more than jingoistic hagiography, is at best disingenuous and distasteful. "
0," Lacking in imagination or genuine scares, Jeepers Creepers 3 falls tragically short on just about every front."
0," [Michael Pena] has never looked so disengaged on screen before, as if incapable of hiding his boredom even while the cameras rolled."
0," War, in case you've forgotten, is hell."
0," By the time this match of wits reaches the inevitable mano-a-mano final showdown, viewers will probably have become weary from all of the incoherent plot twists and ludicrous contrivances. "
2, Anti-war messages don't get any more powerful than this.
2," An incredibly catchy attempt at a retro sex comedy ... while it does go a bit overboard with the raunch at times, it offers enough solid laughs to make it worthwhile."
0," The movie has no audacity or verve; it's all recycled toilet jokes, cheap sentiment, and caricatures."
0," A swamp of clichés, contrivances, and cheap ham-and-cheese hero sentimentality."
0, Gone is the spark that made the relationship between the exuberant Smith and buttoned-up Jones so much fun.
0," Richardson is terrific, but not worth a trip to see this in the theatre."
2," This is a conventional Hollywood spy action film, but Chris Pine shows he is up to the mark as Jack Ryan. Now, if they can just find a smarter script next time ..."
0, It's a heavy-hearted film for a weary time. During a little coda in Russia it takes a deep breath and attempts a serious conclusion but merely ends up being solemn.
2," It's pretty fun, and it doesn't really matter if you don't recall what happened in the previous ""Riddick"" films."
0, A dry and entirely too clinical and gimmicky romantic comedy about the chemical and neurological differences between the sexes. 
2," [Joaquin] Phoenix is at his shell-shocked best as the haunted Joe, veering between explosive violence and surprising tenderness."
2, Why see Saw? Because it has teeth and it cuts to the bone.
0," Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs alters the pattern established by the previous two films, focusing not on the herd but on action-packed, 3-D adventure."
2," [Taika] Waititi knows exactly what his is doing, when the most grizzled, hard-drinking male figure here is female (Tessa Thompson, giving it her full Han Solo treatment)."
0," All the ingredients are there, but it doesn't quite come together."
2," A startling, haunting documentary about a once-great city, ""Detropia"" is all but a eulogy for Detroit."
2," In fact, it represents Duchovny as a capable writer and director with a promising career outside of the X-Files milieu."
0," It's an imperfect facsimile, guilty of borrowing too many ideas from the earlier film, and then executing them with differing results."
0," Kevin Hamedani's muddy, heavy-handed parody of War on Terror paranoia doesn't vary much from genre formula, but it does serve up political correctness with refreshingly bad taste."
0," This ""Overboard"" feels slapped together and ill-considered, content to play as mildly as possible, prepackaged for a long life of cable repetition."
0, Only Marion Cotillard catches the eye in this unrewarding subtitled production.
0, Every action sequence in this grossly over-produced movie looks like designers from Nintendo were creative consultants.
0," It's an archly poetic, earnestly symbolic treatise trying awfully hard to be an important picture, but not succeeding."
0," For a series that has stood out for its uniqueness, this sequel feels sadly traditional and bland."
2, A magnificent movie -- made a masterpiece by Audrey Tautou.
2," Hard Candy is not perfect, but it is a provocative piece of filmmaking with a dark and daring heart that makes it worth seeing."
0, One hell of a mess.
0," [Matthew McConaughey] recent work has demonstrated that he's a man of many talents but even he can't transform a beat that feels so tedious, unnecessary and, sadly, clichéd into a moment that should be powerful and heartbreaking."
2," Shoot Me is precisely as dishy, vulnerable and moving as a biographical doc ought to be."
2," There's something deeply sinister going on in The Wailing and I'm reluctant to divulge too much, because this is a film that's best enjoyed without prior knowledge of what's in store."
0," Paul starts strong with a lot of affectionate, funny jokes about geek culture, book signings, UFOs and comic book conventions, but it eventually falls into self-parody."
0," It looks pretty, the actors try their best, and we may have found a burgeoning star in Amanda Seyfried. Everything else presented here is worth nothing more than a few well-timed eye rolls."
0, I can't remember when a film so well-acted and so well-rendered visually was also so oppressive to sit through.
0," Amateurishly acted, clumsily edited and slapped together out of what looks like surveillance camera footage, the thing bumps along not so much on talent as on audacity."
0, A film that can't decide what it is...but Colin Farrell and David Tennant know what they are. So that's something.
0," Too often, Brüno feels like Borat's weak-wristed brother, too much of it just a gay cliche aimed straight at the American bigot belt."
2, This is a nineties disaster flick that deserves more attention...
0," Frozen, undercooked and sorely lacking much in the way of ""all the trimmings,"" this turkey isn't ready to serve. "
2, Bomb City ends up being a film as angry as it is affected: its form compromises its reasons. [Full Review in Spanish]
2, Doesn't break any new ground or transcend its genre. But it's still very entertaining and never boring.
2," ""Roberts is great when she plays characters with certain levels of neurasthenia or even aggressiveness""."
2," This is a stunning piece of cinema and a perfect, feel-good start to the New Year."
0, A violent and cartoonish take on the '40s gangster scene in LA. 
2," In true Hitchcockian fashion, Everybody Knows is an absorbing film filled with twists and turns and the mesmerizing ambiguity of ""who dunnit"". "
0," Straw dogs, indeed. This new 'Straw Dogs' from writer-director Rod Lurie is a second-rate remake of a memorable and controversial, if not quite great, Vietnam-era Sam Peckinpah film with Dustin Hoffman and British actress Susan George."
0," If I'm spending that much time studying Odin's grooming, there's something wrong with the story, which is kind of slow to get going and features too many undeveloped threads."
2," The moments of high drama are compelling and emotive, and the moments of raw brutality will cause audible gasps."
2, Sumptuously filmed but rather distant.
0, There is nothing new --- just the same high-octane chase scenes and overtly violent battles.
0," Not only can the center not hold, but there is no center to begin with...The story mostly speeds along at an obnoxious rate and pitch, the better to misdirect from the next dumb abracadabra plot twist, but good luck hanging in for over two hours of it."
2," Its brilliance is in its ability to portray a sense of being inside Cobain's head, his music and the demons that plagued him"
0," A bunch of strange, vague ideas crammed into a movie with nowhere to go and absolutely nothing to show us."
2," he surprise is that this film has so many more laughs from start to finish, perfectly complementing its potent combination of girl-power and sweet-natured sentiment."
0," There were tears on my cheeks, but I wasn't feeling a thing."
0, Angels & Demons struggles to maintain momentum as Langdon hurtles around Rome.
2, Deliciously disgusting.
0," Only in Shakespeare land are you allowed to do the same story over and over again. With this version of Spider-Man, a lot of familiar territory leaves one bored and wanting more."
2," This is the gold standard of '40s noir, straight down the line."
2," A warm and wonderfully discursive slice-of-life story, with an emphasis on language and local color and a great feel for the longings of working-class adolescents."
2," There are a number of fine reasons to see the courtroom-meets-family melodrama The Judge. As you might suspect, two stand out: actors Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr."
2, A beautiful performance from Michelle Williams anchors this gentle examination of modern life
0, A tedious bore. Too slow and too many words. A farfetched medieval history lesson. Robert Langdon saves the Catholic Church!
2," Delivers a few memorable, emotional moments, but is too simple to be anything other than average."
0, Beware the quirky Brit-com. They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental.
0, should once and for all spell the end of Larry the Cable Guy's horrendous run of Hollywood hokum.
0," Many complaints were lobbed at Fantastic Four but no one ever suggested it was too smart. Yet it would seem that everyone came to the sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer, determined to dumb it down."
2, The film's messiness is a virtue.
0," A 'scary' movie that isn't scary, The Skeleton Key ranges from deadly dull to perfectly predictable."
2, ...does what most activist documentaries about hot-button issues don't: It successfully shows all sides of the argument.
0," Easily the best thing Eastwood has done in years, though that's not exactly praise considering the director's recent years include such turgid duds like Gran Torino, Invictus and Hereafter."
0," It's poorly made, tired, insultingly simplistic, and a real waste of the talented people who are involved with it."
0, Heather's half-hearted and half-funny send up of the sorts of roles Hollywood has pigeon-holed her into
2, You leave Chicago sated -- and elated.
2," Chilean helmer Pablo Larraín makes an extraordinary English-lingo debut with this daring, many-leveled portrait of history's favorite First Lady."
2, Exceedingly far-fetched but undeniably rousing.
2," ...well-intentioned, agreeable, and frequently hilarious. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," An intentionally monotonous look at the lives of a farmer and his daughter. Strange events signal the end is nigh, but it approaches at the pace of a lethargic inchworm."
2, Haneke's challenge to audiences is to experience real love - it's tough and brutal and definitely not for the faint of heart.
0," The film tries so hard to be smart and funny, but... PK offers a metaphor that's too simplistic to be taken seriously."
0, A preposterous tribute to the heroism of an American tank crew in World War II willing to die for God and country.
0," A stodgy snooze, and Theron, who is about as expressive here as a porcelain doll, lacks all believability."
0, A messy home movie about the competition between two overindulged rock bands. Much angst. Little talent.
2, The particulars of the smash'n'grab are so ridiculous - just how do you swipe a priceless car from a 50th floor apartment? - you just have to keep watching to see how they are going to pull it off.
0, This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time.
0, Boasts some funny vignettes but fails in the crucial test of making us care much about the title character.
2, It's efforts to be inclusive while retaining it's vulgar humor and poop jokes give the film a refreshing breath of air that will make audiences laugh. [Full review in Spanish]
0," In its wobbly whole, Away from Her lingers as a hazy, blurry account of fading moments."
0," Save for a star turn from veteran character actor Josh Pais, Lynn Shelton's latest is pretty much dead on arrival."
0, A movie whose glass is half empty - maybe it's just not possible to have a story about a 5-year-old's de facto stalker that isn't sure what it (or we) should think about the matter.
2," Long, slow and, in the end, nothing new, this adaptation of Eileen Chang's World War II novella can cast a mildly mesmerizing spell if you're in the mood for it."
2," [Boasts] a genuine capacity to delight, whether or not the audiences in question have seen ""The Room."""
2," The film takes a character who would be merely incidental in a more conventional film and uses him to construct a poignant meditation on responsibility, guilt and community."
2, The movie is more than worth seeing ...
2," This is what big screen spectacle used to be -- human, epic, with Mother Nature the greatest horror anybody involved faces"
2," Laugh til' you drop - the musical version of The Producers is finally here. When Mel Brooks conceived his comedy satire, the subject matter of ridiculing Hitler was brave to say the least. And nearly 40 years later, it still leaves bite marks."
2," A huge, sprawling meal of a film that feels like a new classic."
2," Harkens back to the initial days of the oughties spoof craze, when screenwriters actually lampooned film genres rather than whatever the hell happened to catch their eye on YouTube as they sought inspiration."
2, An irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale.
0," The music of Queen will live forever, but this fan hopes the tonedeaf and overpriced tat will not."
0," It's leagues better than the 2992 Kevin Costner fiasco and thankfully devoid of a Bryan Adams song. But that's not good enough, given the talent in front of and behind the camera."
0," The writers take the story precisely where we've come to expect. That said, we've certainly seen worse this year."
2, A beautifully accomplished first film.
0," Maybe it's too much to expect both thoughtfulness and thrills, but I've always been self/ish that way. And with so little intelligent sci-fi out there, it's sad to see this one's intellect crammed into an action-movie body."
2," The power, the movie says, belongs to the players - and to paradigm-skewing artists looking to stir shit up."
2, The contributions are generally illuminating; it's always fun hearing Scorsese warm to a topic (you really feel Hitchcock is an element he swims in like a seal).
2," The vision for the film is clear, and as Wheelman's priorities and plans crystalize, the movie shifts gears into a full-throated action/chase film that's truly cinematic, edge of your seat stuff."
0, The film neglects its characters and many of them lack purpose. [full review in Spanish]
2," I like to look at it as a film where brains go flying in a fairly convincing, somewhat entertaining manner."
0," He certainly never shuts up, and he never stops joking; he's a neurotic narcissist to whom a war and a country's misery mean little except how they affect him personally."
0," The movie needs a rewrite and reshoot or just Whitney Houston's voice belting out ""I Will Always Love You."" Or it needs to be ignored."
0," Michelle Pfeiffer is quite good, but the script leaves Kathy Bates -- talented as she is -- with a bit of a cartoonish performance."
2, A lively but meandering doc that is more seduced by the scene than some viewers might like.
2, Ilha do Medo é O Iluminado de Martin Scorsese.
2," The Water Diviner is one father's crusade for peace as he wades through the devastation of war. Mr. Crowe has done an accomplished job of revisiting Gallipoli, with an open heart. "
2," Honesty and courage are the main virtues of A Mighty Heart, which strives to shed light on dark times. Central to it is Jolie's laudable performance."
0, It might seem strange to say this but in reviewing Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven I almost wish that I were not so familiar with Douglas Sirk's oeuvre.
0," So what is a dog's purpose? To provide gentle, forgettable entertainment for moviegoers who lament that ""they"" don't make ""nice"" movies anymore, apparently."
2," How can a movie so derivative be so genuinely funny? The Glory in this case comes from the bright, sunny cast, including a luminous Rachel McAdams and a sparklingly grouchy Harrison Ford."
2," [Hirschbiegel's] polished storytelling technique -- the use of wide-angle lenses to generate menace, the singling out of dramatic sounds -- creates a pleasure almost independent of the grim theme."
2," The title character is a child, but two adult actors, Kathy Bates and Glenn Close, really give ""The Great Gilly Hopkins"" its considerable heart."
2, Her gentle name is deceiving. 'Hanna' is a cold-blooded killer. Saoirse Ronan plays a teenager who isn't the kind of girl you want to upset in this action-packed thriller that's sort of a juvenile version of 'Run Lola Run.'
0," They got the right star for sure, but they haven't given her a proper vehicle."
0," If Part 2 was a clone of its predecessor, Part 3 is the genetic trash left over from trying to replicate the success of the first film."
2," The songs are solid and This Is Me, like all great Top 40 summer tunes, has an anthemic chorus that embeds itself in one's head for days."
0," A mindless, milling mess. Just what you would expect from somebody schooled in the Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer academy of bad directing."
0, Why leave all that wreckage in their path if there's no real point; no insightful takeaway?
2, A sweeping and poetic piece of love. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," Energised by a game performance and toe-tapping soundtrack, this is nevertheless a film that never really settles into a satisfying groove, nor confidently projects an identity."
2," Holes isn't just a movie to see, it's also one to be proud of."
0, Sabotages itself.
0," It's all meant to be a cutting- edge examination of changing times, non-traditional breeding/parenting, but to my eyes there wasn't enough here to distinguish Julie and Jason from their co-habitating friends."
0," Its funniest single line is a reference to the incest documentary Capturing the Friedmans. If nothing in that last sentence makes any sense to you, stay well away."
2, The original cast go out with a bang.
0, Supernatural-themed comedy lacks spark.
0," Highly improbable, maniacally action-packed."
2, Undeniably essential viewing.
0," If you want a gore fix, this is it. If you're looking for a film with purpose, better wait until the bill changes."
2," By now, the franchise is mainly about giving the audience more of what it's already given it, and the gifted writer-director Rian Johnson (Looper) delivers just that..."
0, Director Ang Lee is to be commended for at least at-tempting to go beyond what could have been an empty special effects bonanza. But the subject of strained child/parent relationships is treated superficially.
2, ... a well-meaning but perfectly conventional message movie.
0," Pretty people with pretty problems will always be playing on a screen somewhere, but this one is better suited for watching while folding laundry."
0, Some of the movie succeeds; some of it falls flat. But you can't say it doesn't try to live up to the corny reputation of sci-fi in the mid-twentieth century.
2, So meta it hurts.
2," Despite the problems with the story, it works pretty well because of strong characters, good performances and a nice plot twist."
0," Though well-researched and competently acted, At Any Price doesn't risk much, having neither a thesis nor a resolution. Like an awkward hug between estranged relations, there's a lack of confidence in the execution."
0," A macabre comedy of manners with the sting of dry ice, this 2007 ensemble piece captures the social climate of America in the late 40s."
0, Sandler's unflappable Jewish gigolo superhero hairdresser act is an overconceptualized drag.
0," It's a movie that starts slowly, and only starts moving us to the edge of our seat in the third act, adequate for a horror picture, but no more."
2," War of the Worlds may not stand up well to careful inspection and it may not be the smartest science fiction film brought to the screen, but it is an intense, visceral experience."
2," Campy, funny, shocking, and seeping with sardonic social commentary, ""Django Unchained"" is Quentin Tarantino's finest film to date. "
0," The stars? Well, while I'm sure they had fun phoning in their performances - I hope they've destroyed the records - I can't help wishing they were all doing something more interesting."
0, 'Neat to watch' summarizes the film quite nicely. The revenge subplot that drives Fast and Furious is uninteresting since we haven't seen these characters in eight years.
0," A competent, uncontroversial, rather shouty version of a play which is now safely canonical and, if the philistinism may be forgiven, less remarkable than it once seemed, when dramas of the liberal conscience had an urgent edge."
0," [Harold] Ramis and co-writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg mostly avoid the easy anachronism jokes, to their credit, but instead they wind up plumbing the depths of poop, fart, urine, foreskin and gay-panic humor."
0," The director's unmoored script does not provide the cohesiveness necessary to build tension, create character and enhance story."
2, I'll always pay money to see a Bill Murray movie.
0," A grim, formulaic saga in desperate need of some genuine B-movie fury and flair."
2," [It's] smart, funny and impossibly good-looking."
2," The conclusions are familiar -- friendship provides support, death makes squabbles seem petty, what's past is past -- but far from meaningless."
0," Screenwriter Richard Curtis tries to direct, puts too many eggs in his basket, and winds up with a very runny omelette."
0," My favorite groaner moment takes place during a backyard barbecue, where everyone drinks Peroni beer and makes sure the labels face the camera."
2," It is a work that appears to ask so little from its audience (not much more than patience and an alert eye), but gives a heck of a lot back."
2," A subtle and unexpected pleasure, all nuanced performance and character detail."
2," [Anderson] may make it look easy because of how firmly his mannerisms are established at this point, but it takes a real artist to evoke the rocky emotional storms of adolescence and adulthood with such clear eyes and precise voice."
2, This masterpiece may seem corny to some 55 years later but it never fails to bring a tear to my eye and an ache in my heart.
2," ...while the film might not drop the cumulative emotional anchor you may expect...it's a smartly entertaining tale, delivered with respect for its subject matter, but also wisely knows you can be fun and funny even in the arena of an AIDS drama."
0, It's all perfectly pleasant and perfectly harmless and perfectly bland.
0," Like the source novel, Marc Forster's film is frequently contrived and melodramatic."
0, Nothing Makes Sense
2, A fascinating journey through Chile's troubled past.
2," A potent blend of eroticism, pent-up feelings and good old-fashioned appreciation of beauty."
2, Don't be dismayed if you can't grasp every plot point quickly and easily. The images you see and things you hear need time to ruminate and be savored.
0," ...the Yagahl speak English with an inflection that ranges from fake-African to fake-Russian, sometimes within the same sentence."
2," Emotionally precise, subtle and quietly gripping."
2," Rivette, working from a story he developed with Pascal Bonitzer and Christine Laurent, ushers us slyly toward an ending that surprises and provokes, yet offers the possibility of love reborn."
2, A rollickingly entertaining movie.
2, An uneven but arresting indie thriller about two siblings who are driven to heroic extremes by childhood traumas.
2," Forget Crosby, Stills and Nash and maybe even Crazy Horse. Jonathan Demme might be Neil Young's ultimate collaborator."
2," There's no getting away from the fact that Ant-Man And The Wasp, as fun as it is, lacks the sheer, mind-blowing heft of Infinity War... In this new era of Marvel over-achievement, it really does feel like a lesser work."
2," Ratchet & Clank is an energetic, animated and colorful trip down memory lane aimed at the blurry-eyed fans who have carpal tunnel syndrome from all those hours playing the game."
0," ...a drab, dark, slow movie with absolutely no chemistry between or among any of the players...the color so washed out that it might as well have been in black & white."
0," After being surprised by Fifty Shades Of Grey, you can now colour me disappointed with Fifty Shades Darker."
0," As a mental illness narrative in particular, it feels perilously phoney."
2," A very satisfying, entertaining and thought-provoking thriller."
2," Yes, a conventional documentary about sex slavery would probably be more illuminating. It would also be more unbearable."
0," The increasing sameness of these films (an evil future society, a young hero/heroine who must both confront the authorities and escape from them) is becoming pretty familiar."
2," [VIDEO ESSAY] Written by Sam Shepherd, and adapted by L.M. Kit Carson, the linear story for ""Paris, Texas"" contains the hallmarks of Shepherd's characteristic dramatic themes..."
0," Tolkien could invent names and languages, but he couldn't create a plot at gunpoint. "
2," What makes the doc watchable, of course, are the musical sequences, whether he's playing Tchaikovsky, Bach or Williams."
0," Plays closer to the Joel Schumacher campy sequel Batman & Robin: convoluted, junky and obsessed with form-fitting leather costumes."
2," There's little difference between the first and second movies so the perfunctory story line will feel familiar to fans. But the action, and the head-spinning stunts of those agile lead actors, will never get old."
0," Once Roy strips away the mystery from his characters, Pari loses its way, and it feels like a laboured finish to the end. Even those easily scared (like this reviewer) will find no need to avert their eyes."
0, Some movies get you so excited - so revved up on action and thrills -- that you almost feel like you're flying. Cliffhanger makes you feel like you're dropping.
2," It's all pretty dazzling. It can certainly wear you out, but take the kids anyway, they'll probably dig it."
2," A thriller in the tradition of military whodunits like A Few Good Men, with lots of menacing suspense, deceptive intrigue and even a few 'You can't handle the truth'-caliber one-liners."
2," Hunnam and Malek both hold up their end of the deal. Noer, for his part, meets them halfway ..."
0," If one is the loneliest number, two is company, three is a crowd and four is an orgy, then eighty-eight must be the universal symbol for unwatchability."
0, ... this script is so woefully pedestrian that it casts a pall on the whole exercise and takes everything down with it. 
0," The film deflates the reason why she is a compelling figure, if at all. Her courage during her confinement, %u2026 and her ultimate death made her an honorary member of the Dead Blonde Hall of Fame. Her victimization made her an icon."
2," Nicolas Cage is enormously, paradoxically likable as a genuine monster."
0, Not even the arch-villain gets to say anything resembling the kind of wit that we expect of bad guys.
0," A sloppy, shambling farce..but Kutcher's amiability, Stamp's skill and the sporadically inventive slapstick make it more tolerable than you might expect."
2," The Post's central message is beware of fake news. Ultimately, Spielberg does achieve what he set out to do and that's to provoke critical thinking - what is truth and what is fake."
0, Though Boll now has his own fan base who love his awfulness -- the crowd I saw the movie with cheered when his name came up onscreen at the end -- he isn't consistent enough for my liking/disliking.
0," If you're a big Dennis Rodman fan, watch him playing basketball. If you're not, then you have zero reason to take in this movie."
2," An aggressively weird, suitably uneven and decidedly un-kid-friendly keg-stand of nostalgia for those unable to scrub the fever-dream of a series from their memories."
2," The drama unfolds with the pace and tone of a nature show. Like watching exotic cats hunt unattractive prey, you're on neither team's side -- at least, not for long."
2," Ridiculous, but gleefully so."
0," ""Our mission is to find our necks,"" Rock tells his ornery platoon. ""I left mine in a locker at Gold's Gym in 2985, and I haven't seen it since."""
2, [Crash] is sharply observed and frequently extremely funny as well as artfully orchestrated.
2," A gruelling, testing drama, that's carried by an impressive, heartfelt performance from Chemla, who confidently runs the gamut from light, carefree youth to the careworn figure of bitterly disillusioned middle age."
0," Just terrible. A by-the-numbers, paycheck film if ever there was one. "
2," This isn't the first horror movie to exploit the isolation of its location, but Minihan sets his film apart from the pack with an audacious script and equally bold images to match."
2," It's a fabulous melding of voice talent, writing and animation that makes ""Puss in Boots"" so entertaining. "
2, A fearsome plunge into the world of child soldiers in present-day West Africa.
2," Fans of Pirates and Gulliver's Travels may be tempted by this giddy adaptation, but those who hold the tales of the Musketeers dearly to heart may feel a little wanting."
0," What keeps Daddy's Home watchable is Wahlberg's checkmate machismo, as the intimidating foil necessary for Ferrell's namby-pambyism to register. It's like watching Andy Samberg's SNL impersonation of tough guy Mark Wahlberg, a self-parody of a spoof."
0," In its wan attempt to be raunchy, the picture fails where Judd Apatow has usually succeeded; written by three women, this is a girl's mistaken idea of an R-rated comedy."
0," If this is the kind of garbage kids are watching and absorbing with glee today, no wonder the country is in such a mess."
0, The erratically funny film feels more like Stiller and his friends got together to get paid for messing around.
2, Wall*E is poised to take its place alongside other Pixar instant classics.
2, A look at the sprawling and incredibly powerful Camorra crime family in Italy shows mostly the lurid details of conventional crime. The value of the film lies in exposing crime that is not business as usual.
0," Feardotcom is full of inconsistencies and contradictions, but none are more disturbing than the fact that not a single policeman wears gloves at any of the umpteen crime scenes scattered throughout the film."
0," Will Smith has fame, fortune, and a beautiful family, but that's not enough -- he wants you to know what a beneficent guy he is too."
2, Deserves credit for artfully presenting its nightmarish moral dilemmas with little pretense or grandstanding.
0," This film's as divorced from reality as any romantic comedy I can ever recall, and if I my nuptials were to look even remotely like the ones depicted here than here is my vote to staying single for now and well into the foreseeable future."
2, Zero Dark Thirty is an emotional thrill ride; a film that shows you what it wants you to see and lets you decide your moral stance. 
0, It might hold some appeal if you're as teenager with a thing for dirt bikes.
2, Warm Bodies' new spin on some very familiar zombie tropes makes for a rather enjoyable time regardless of its shortcomings.
2," Even though we could reasonably wonder if there had to be yet another one of these blasted suburban satires, at least Revolutionary Road is a pretty good entry in the field."
0," What could have been a roguish send-up of marriage, technology, and all that falls in between is reduced to a cloying feel-good fable about reciprocal altruism in the face of total annihilation."
2," Thank goodness for Fey, who lends this sitcom soap a credible emotional center."
2," It may be little more than an expensive arcade game for overgrown kids, but it moves too fast for critical flak to stick."
2, It definitely rang true to me.
2," The Class, an Oscar-nominated French film about a Paris middle school, should be required viewing for anybody considering a career in teaching."
0," Crude, stupid, shallow and infantile; towards the end of That Awkward Moment, a taxi hits one of the characters, obviously for ""comic"" effect. I gave that cab a standing ovation and was bereft to discover it didn't finish the job."
2, A big cool fun movie.
0, Too much minutia and drilling.
2," While hardly a riveting spy story, this documentary reveals much of whistleblower Edward Snowden's character while warning of a dangerous loss of civil liberties in America."
2," While the meandering pace, which doesn't create any sense of urgency, may be a bit slow for some viewers, this is a richly drawn and rewarding film that stays with you."
2, An energetic and tantalizing film that promises more than it can ultimately deliver
0," The problem is that for most of the running time, How Do You Know meanders and has a hard time finding the right tone, lurching forward from one scene to the next."
0," Abrahamson seems fascinated with the idea of gothic storytelling, but he hasn't quite got the knack of it."
2," Cave and director John Hillcoat work Matt Bondurant's vivid, brutal prose well and, although it won't win anything in Cannes, Lawless is a cut above most mainstream American crime-dramas."
0," BKB is a greedy, crowded drama that isn't impulsive enough to do justice to each of its littler films. I won't be dwelling on it too much, though."
2," It shows how poetry is capable of creating life even in a policeman and how the humble, anonymous human being needs the poet as much as he needs the people. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," This well-acted, well-written but self-consciously hip seriocomedy could use more of Earl and the dying girl; instead, it's all about Me, Me, Me."
0, This is a tedious tale badly told.
0, Setting new standards in historical inaccuracy.
2," awash in culinary imagery, and it's enough to make you want to run out, purchase some Le Creuset cookware, and start deboning a duck"
0," The script pokes endless fun at American overindulgence, from SUVs to obesity. But the shots are cheap not just because they're so obvious, but because you get the sense no one who made this movie believes any of it."
2," Engaging and emotionally edgy, families don't come more dysfunctional than this one."
2," A remarkable, creative, and thought-provoking drama about treasuring love and sustaining marriage. "
2," Lowery focuses on melancholy moods, inner turmoil and the golden glow of cornfields to create an earnest, leisurely tale of lost souls and last chances."
0," While not about pornography, The Canyons can't help but possess that same lurid whiff of XXX material, from the crotchy, skeevy sweatiness, right down to its poor acting, tossed-off dialogue and visibly low production values..."
2," Won't win the 85-year-old Derbyshire native any new fans, but is nevertheless an absorbing portrait of ""the Beast of Bolsover""."
0," There are moments of charm and it is a sweet story which kids might find entertaining enough, but chances are they will become just as restless as my crowd as the film stretches on."
2," Driver is turning out to be one of the finest actors of the moment, an understated star with a great, non-movie-star face."
2, I laughed pretty much throughout the entirety of American Wedding.
0," Don't Say a Word is a Michael Douglas movie that never stops feeling like a Michael Douglas movie, even when it ought to stop feeling like one."
0, Even cinematographer Adam Suschitzky's richly textured and resonantly toned cityscapes and rural scenes can't make up for a flawed script and weak performances in what might have been a powerful historical drama.
2, Kids doesn't let itself or us off the hook; we're all responsible for what we see. And what we won't see.
2," It tells a full story with three acts, it introduces characters we get to know and care about, and it has something it passionately wants to say."
2, High Fantasy is an inventive and entertaining South African feature that cleverly yokes heavy subject matter to an agile DIY aesthetic.
2, A moderately amusing shaggy dog story that evokes director Wes Anderson's love for human beings with quirky personality traits.
2," Everett's structured his film as a series of memories held loosely together by his various recitations of his fairy tale, his death bed in a cramped Parisian rented room set like a stage play."
2," Benefits from the forceful presence of Sam Worthington (Avatar) in the key role and is full of high flying action, nifty monsters, valiant heroes, plotting villains and impressive CGI."
2," An exciting, beautifully shot look at a subculture through the eyes of one of its most devoted admirers."
2," At least the characters register, and the action is vaguely coherent within the total lack of logic."
2," There are certain productions that wear a broad smile and carry little personality, with director Michel Hazanavicius's valentine to moviemaking days of yore perfectly, utterly, monumentally...fine. "
2," The landscape plays a major role... with its bleak, open spaces, adding to the feeling that the characters and their emotions are curiously incidental."
0," Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang contains a lot of comedy and invention, but doesn't much benefit from its clever style."
0," Starting on Monday, Coogan and Bryden share meals . . . and what passes for conversation. When they're not insufferable, they're boring"
2," Kudos to co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and the team of writers for juggling more than a dozen comic-book characters and nearly that many plot lines, and only occasionally getting us (and by us I mean ME) lost in the Geek Weeds."
0," With bland protagonists and power figures unpleasant enough for us to want them out of our sight more than we want them defeated, it doesn't do much to hold our interest."
2," Italian filmmaker Stefano Sollima (Suburra, 2025) is a great artist and has no need to envy Villeneuve in terms of his style and his ability to film ugliness and aesthetic violence. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, [Director Chazz] Palminteri seems to have accepted the heavy-handed nature of the screenplay and embraced it whole-heartedly.
2, This is a movie for those who say they don't make 'em like they used to.
0," Justice League is just fine. But considering that the would-be blockbuster features a collection of A-list superheroes, the word ""fine"" is like kryptonite. "
0, ...I prefer my Lynch artistically shackled by the restraints of a film camera.
0," Too often plays like an earnest yet unsatisfying adaptation of a cult graphic novel, with most of the charm lost in translation."
0," The performances find the ideal tone of closure, leaving the future relationship between these three more intriguing than anything established in the film."
0," The set-up here is so sparse it almost plays as a joke, a sneer at the notion that a film with this many car crashes could need something so snobbish as a story. "
2, Not since Marty McFly have we seen someone so in love with being a rocker.
2, Doesn't fully live up to all the expectations but is still enjoyable.
0, About the best that can be said for Mel Gibson's overblown indulgence in sadism is that at least it isn't anti-Semitic.
0," As an alleged witty comedy of humanistic charm, it sags in both, thanks to unfunny predicaments and a phony plot."
0," Great moments stud Bernardo Bertolucci's 2976 Marxist epic, but the end result is ambiguous."
2," If there's a problem with the film, it's the idea that two people would instinctively choose to immerse themselves in unbroken role play."
2," The film stitches together an astounding collection of archival materials, supplemented by period reenactmentsand concepts adapted from Jon Savage's 2007 book of the same name."
0, Lee's latest film feels like several intriguing ideas in search of an over-arching story.
2," Moana is an exceedingly joyful film and every bit the life-affirming catharsis many will be looking for this holiday season, particularly if you have a daughter during these times."
0," If not for classic FM rock songs overstating the obvious it would be tough to identify We Bought a Zoo as a Cameron Crowe movie. This dramedy could come from anyone who spent the past decade not living up to his promise, and sorely needs a hit."
0," Good luck with yourself, Greenberg. But I think I want to break up."
2," The result is a striking hybrid: at once impressionistic and argumentative, focused on individuals but also alert to the role, frequently unheralded, that women played in the civil-rights movement. Not to be missed."
2," Superb, overlooked Vietnam drama may be Brian DePalma's finest hour."
2, The superb performances certainly play an instrumental role in triggering the film's shift from passable to engrossing...
0, A pretentious mess.
0," It's well-shot and stylish, but slow and rather dull, with emotionally distant characters and a weak ending."
0, Predictably ridiculous.
2," None of this is earthshaking, but Prince Caspian is a largely satisfying experience -- not too serious and not too silly with just the right 'wow' factor."
2," Much of the film's ''entertainment value'' rests on the sadistically outlandish performance of Dieter Laser, who's like Boris Karloff starring in a movie by Rainer Werner Fassbinder."
2," POTC: At World's End clocks in at more than 2 3/4 hours, but, unlike last year's bloated sequel, at least possesses some semblance of a destination, making it slightly more coherent -- if no less numbing during the protracted finale."
0," Bitter, ugly and painful to watch. Given the choice between a repeated bludgeoning with a tire iron and sitting through Observe and Report, go with the tire iron, you'll feel better when it's over."
2, Miss Sharon Jones! is a refreshing take on a documentary sub-genre that has seen growing abundance in recent years.
2," An enjoyable, frequently funny comedy-drama with terrific performances from Sandler and Rogen, but it's also way too long and the first half is much stronger than the second."
0," Offensive, amateurish and should be avoided, then forgotten. Who's the Daddy? Who cares?"
2, The beginning [is] brilliant. [Full Review in Spanish] 
0," Me, I would rather have enjoyed a big breakfast."
0," The filmmaker's ham-fisted attempts to supply some socio-political relevance to such intractable material finally lands him in a deeper, murkier swamp..."
2," Berlin Syndrome is like one of those '90s high concept thrillers, where the perfect guy turns out to be bad. Only its a lot more raw and grimy than those polished studio movies of that decade."
0, This is one of the worst movies of the year -- maybe the worst.
0," You can't help but reflect that Sacha Baron Cohen squeezed more out of his recent agitprop stunts, or wish for the narrower focus of a documentary like Sabaah Folayan's Whose Streets?"
0, Watching this film is like paying a visit to a schoolmate who never got tired of joy buzzers and whoopee cushions.
2," It is little more than a reminder, as if one was needed, that Homer is still crazy after all these years and that The Simpsons are a still-reliable laundry line for stupid sight gags and one-liners."
0," I never thought I'd say this about a Joel Schumacher project, but this thing could use some neon."
0, so far fetched that I couldn't swallow the story
2," For those who like their movies wrapped in a tight bow, you're not going to get it here."
0," There's a whole lot of digging, but not much suspense or interest dug up in ""The Dig."""
2, This film contains the best Batman theme song...ever.
0," Too good for action, its action is flaccid; too good for hip, its hipsterism is tired."
0, Uneven origin story is disappointing; expect some violence.
2," Gripping while it lasts, but will be hard to remember in the morning."
0, While it provides a succinct and straightforward history lesson ... Studio 54 never quite moves past the glitz and the glamour.
0," Time and again, good material is introduced and discarded."
2," This film is inventive, fascinating and endearing but also sketch-lite, a trifle dull in colour-muting 3D and emotionally detached."
2, Arterton carries it along with her charisma and her subtle emoting elevates a film that too often plumps for the obvious.
2," Themes we can relate to -- familial embarrassments, the stultification of the working class, [...] the importance of having a sense of humor -- are so beautifully relayed by Ade's graceful hand."
0," Streep in her black bonnet and Hoffman with his meticulously parted hair and long, clean fingernails are never quite believable."
2, The feel-good film of the year and one that reminds the world to be kind to one another. 
0," Lifetime's Whitney Houston biopic was confusingly bland, and we're not happy about it."
0," That final act keeps the film from reaching the pedestal on which the original is placed, but you could do a lot worse than a reunion of Burgundy and friends this holiday season."
2," Although each Jurassic movie is fated to essentially repeat the same idea-oh no, dinosaurs!-this new era has come up with ways to surprise, terrify, and inspire, which is enough to keep the heart of the franchise beating."
0," Directed without much imagination, P2 is gory and gruesome, yet never scary or affecting."
2," This movie isn't about dreaming, it's about the dreams inside of the dreams inside of the dreams. It's about how many layers there are to the human psyche, how the demons which haunt our subconscious can inflict a very conscious harm."
0, THE NECESSARY DEATH OF CHARLIE COUNTRYMAN is the unnecessary death of a potentially good movie.
0," I found the plot slow and while sometimes I can get through that, the character arcs weren't there either to really draw me back in."
0," Despite the filmmakers' best intentions, Only the Brave, which is expanded from former Boston Herald reporter Sean Flynn's GQ article, emerges as inert drama as we ever so slowly journey to that awful end."
0, I urgently advise hospitals: Do not make the DVD available to your patients; there may be an outbreak of bedpans thrown at TV screens.
2," The cast is uniformly good - this is a hallmark of director Jason Reitman, who has an uncanny ability to put the right actor in the right role and to get the right performance. Even tiny roles stand out."
2," Tightly scripted, good old-fashioned crime drama pitting two of our finest actors against each other in the courtroom. Not one computer effect or clichéd one-liner to be found."
2," Unseen for 35 years, its spectacle is undimmed, and you can pick many highlights."
2," In exploring the power of myth to inspire men to fight, it aspires to be something more than just a lot of guys clanging swords, shields, and clubs. "
2," Again, totally preaching to the choir (of which I'm obviously part), so I'm not sure what the intent is here. All I know is I liked it."
2," Its vivid sense of place and time make it compulsively watchable, even at a running time of two and a half hours."
2," Miles Ahead is nothing anyone's going to fall in love with, but something interesting in its approach to stroke your goatee to, like those jazz albums you pretend to like."
0," Reygadas' gift for imagery is undeniable, but for most viewers, Battle in Heaven will offer not enlightenment but frustration."
2," And while falling well short of rational proof, the story does raise intriguing questions about the fundamental nature of faith, questions that have puzzled mankind for centuries."
2, The movie has a zippy script by Audrey Wells ... as well as a supersized order of funny supporting characters.
2, ...ultimately fits comfortably within the pantheon of above-average body-switching comedies.
0," Like many recent entries to Neeson's canon, The Commuter is fairly involving until it comes time to explain what's going on."
2, Barry Jenkins' adaptation of the James Baldwin novel is so beautiful it hurts.
2," Sure, this is a slightly different mythology, but it's impossible to engage in a story that can't surprise us. Fortunately, the rom-com subplot is thoroughly involving."
0," The story is both unwieldy and nonsensical, spending, as it does, far too much time on the annoying Ukrainian, complicated plot twists and dialogue."
0," Cranston and Hart ... do everything they can to find charm, but they're trying to make a pie from rotten fruit. The Upside never should've been made."
2," Watchable comedy enlivened by likeable performances from all four leads, but it's neither as emotionally engaging nor as laugh-out-loud funny as it thinks it is, and the script is entirely predictable."
0, Here's a movie that could easily have been dialogue-free. And probably would have been better for it.
0, Osmosis is missing a spark.
2, Herzog brings 3D to the art-house documentary crowd
0," About halfway through the film, I realized I would be way more interested in a film about the making of Human Centipede 3 than I was in Human Centipede 3. But I don't want to give Six any ideas."
2," (W)hen Tommy Lee Jones...tells how funny his roommate, Al Gore, was, is asked for specifics, and gives them totally deadpan, I was laughing uncontrollably."
2," While the technology is a dampener and the plotting burdensome, Flying Swords has enough charm and pizzazz to merit a good time at the movies."
0," The fleeting moments of wit, subtlety, inventiveness and visual flair only clear the low bar of making this slightly more tolerable than ""I, Frankenstein"" -which similarly defiled a classic character in the futile hope for a fertile franchise."
0, This is a dangerous slice of propaganda that actually has the temerity to end with a family unit walking arm-in-arm into a rosy sunset. 
0," This ribald romp, thanks to its unrelenting violence, ultimately outstays its welcome."
2, The audience in my theater cheered and hollered after each show stopper.
2, Barber's overabundance of language and logos - her insistence on the artificiality and constructedness of the Scientist's natural environs - positions the jungle as a space of subconscious play rather than a lost paradise.
0, Let's all come together and hope to God that nothing as degrading as this garbage is released as a theatrical feature or published as a book ever again.
2, This coolly beautiful film is both a superior thriller and an engrossing study of a sociopath's progress.
2, The Wall packs a surprisingly savage punch by boiling the exploits of battle down to its essential elements.
2, An old-fashioned Disney fairy tale gussied up in 3D for the holidays.
2, Hollywood filmmakers are no slouches these days when it comes to subverting or sending-up fairy-tale conventions. But Kenneth Branagh does something much more daring. He plays things straight.
0, To view it is to keep a mental checklist of all the films in which we've previously encountered these same tropes.
0," That's the problem with all of ""Vision Quest"" -- when the movie ends with Louden narrating off-screen his ""live for today"" philosophy, it's plausible in his mouth, a joke for adults."
2, Bill Murray goes Bing Crosby in this hipster holiday classic. 
2," As the journey comes to an end, it's hard as a movie buff to think of anything on the movie horizon that could be more exciting and well-executed than ""Return of the King."" "
2," A movie in which many f*cks are spoken, but few given."
2, Savour one of cinema's rawest talents finally powerslamming his way to glory and be grateful that Aronofsky dragged himself off the ropes on countless occasions to convince the money men to finance the movie with such a seemingly unbankable lead actor.
0," By adhering to coming-of-age formula and relying on plot contrivances, it downplays the internal struggles of its closeted protagonist, and thus reduces the emotional impact."
2," A smart, super raunchy comedy with cast chemistry that's through the roof. Kay Cannon makes her feature directorial debut with a film that boasts a winning ratio of laughs and heart."
2," All in all, A Monster Calls is a highly satisfying film."
0," The film almost overwhelms the audience with information, throwing out so many facts and figures, and so much footage, that it's all hard to process."
0," Messy and disconnected, not scary but not really funny, and nearly completely uninteresting."
0, There's a lot to like in this movie. This is why it's such a shame that the whole thing was ruined by a few minutes of footage.
2," Sinks its teeth into the undead basics, and yet still manages to carve out its own territory rather than mindlessly following the masses."
2," Decide for yourself what ""Slacker Uprising"" is and what the rewards were, if any; I had a real love-hate relationship with it..."
0," If there's one thing these early-20-somethings don't deserve, it's sympathy..."
0," Weak, boring docudrama lacks heart: nostalgia lovers only."
2," Though I completely understand the thought process behind the decision, there simply isn't enough action in ""Part 2"" to justify a separate movie. "
2," There is a clear clarity to every performance from start to finish, from Roberts all the way down. "
2," Like most British realist dramas, When Did You Last See Your Father? is stuffed with team-player acting."
2," sick, twisted, and guaranteed to leave you numb, or nauseous, or both"
0," Not that it matters but it was horrible. Zsa Zsa Gabor wigs, 99%u023C Store makeup, and overall lousy filmmaking. Disney vampires without teeth or lust %u2023 is this really what pre-teens want?"
2," Well-crafted, wellintentioned and well, just a tad dull, Redford's radical-chic-road-trip will appeal to the Senior Railcard crowd."
2," Best of all is Parker, the perfect melancholy romantic hero, brooding and dark, yet touching and sentimental."
2," There won't be a faster, more furious movie this year. "
2," Fey's combination of deadpan delivery, comic timing and deep sympathy for all things goofy keeps the narrative part of the film swinging from scene to scene in nimble fashion, but it's the monkeys who rule this kingdom."
0," [Vikander] invests herself in Lara Croft, and the filmmakers, unlike the ones Jolie got saddled with, frame her with awe rather than lust. Now if only they could bring some of that awe to the tombs..."
2, Ballsy filmmaking.
0, ... neither particularly fantastic nor adventurous.
0," Similar to the scenario of the original picture, it's a band of grizzled soldier types who battle the alien menaces. Missing, however, is a formidable leading-man presence in the Schwarzenegger mold."
2," Thought-provoking and unnerving, emotionally engaging and intellectually stimulating."
0," The Girl From Monaco doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a sprightly sex comedy or an enigmatic little thriller. Unfortunately, it's neither very funny nor very thrilling."
0," The filmmakers' determination to make a naughty teen comedy based on deception (and Nathaniel Hawthorne) is undone by age-blind miscasting, a heavy hand and an overall misjudged tone."
2, Get Low has all the modest pleasures of a well-told tale.
2, Luther is the textbook radical: he acts out what his contemporaries merely profess.
0," Even the handful of good ideas that the movie works aren't enough to compensate for its overall formulaic, repetitive, chase-and-fight approach."
2," My Friend Dahmer feels very much authentic to its time and its protagonist, who is destined to be the worst kind of antagonist."
2," A bit manipulative, but Divide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailes is a timely portrait of institutionalized sexual harassment at Fox News."
0, I've never played the game. Hopefully it's more fun. 
0, A forgettable comedy that shoul've been better written. [Full review in Spanish]
0," The kind of careful, listless adaptation that makes a critic want to rave at length about the wonderful novel on which it's based."
2, A movie brimming with beautiful people and beautiful scenery; there's a contagious enthusiasm as this movie whirs through the sights and sounds of Barcelona.
2," Clooney had a great year, and his stellar work here is the capper."
0," Wildly inconsistent in tone, it is impossible to know whether the film aspires to comedy; it's certainly not funny."
2, A date that begins with the salacious movie Exterminating Angels is likely to end up either in bed or in court.
2," Greek doesn't quite know when to stop, and things aren't brought to a particularly satisfying resolution. But Brand does a nice job adding a few dramatic shadings to his character, a pleasant surprise. And Hill is outstanding."
2, The film is both the last great gasp of '60s hippie ethos and the first masterpiece of what would become an increasingly technocratic '80s movie-house takeover. 
2," It is Fassbender, in dual roles, who is the real focus of the movie, and he is the best he's been in years-perverse, haunted, magnetic, touching and unique."
2," The Simpsons Movie gives us much of what we love about the characters, and if there is not enough of some of them, there is something of most of them."
0, It's a fairly standard murder mystery with some good acting and an ending that comes out of nowhere.
0," Too intent to cement her as an idol, And Still I Rise just won't let stories tell the whole picture."
0," In a word, ugly. It just pips Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (aka Halloween 6) to the title of worst Halloween film ever."
2," Simmers intently beneath a veneer of cool propriety, just as its subject herself did...a richly textured expression of its maker's distinctive voice, in the processing capturing Dickinson's as well."
0," It pretends to be hungry like the wolf, yet it ends up doing the safety dance."
0, Both silly and preachy.
2," Damon's rarely been better as a seemingly normal guy who you never really get a handle on, but the light-toned narrative could certainly be snappier."
0," ... flat characters, flat animation, a bland rock soundtrack ... Titan A.E. might as well be Titanic A.E. (as in, the ship that sunk, not the movie that scored.)"
2, It's all so godd---ed beautiful. I love these movies.
2," My Blind Brother explores this unconventional dynamic with gentle humor and a refreshing amount of sensitivity, brushing up against the more cringe-worthy aspects of its premise without reveling in them."
0," It takes an extraordinary amount of patience to tolerate this picture, and an even greater suppression of basic survival logic to enjoy it."
2, It's interesting to note that Poekel sold Christmas trees for five years to get the money to finance the film.
0," Park Chul-soo directs a film about love, growing up, and a doubtful, to say the least, S. Korean law. However, there is no deep analysis, as the focus is on entertainment, rather than context with the steamy sex scenes take a large part of its duration"
2," Not only one of the best films of 2009, but one of the best gay-themed films ever...The most authentically detailed period film since 2002's ""Far from Heaven"""
2," Harkens back to the initial days of the oughties spoof craze, when screenwriters actually lampooned film genres rather than whatever the hell happened to catch their eye on YouTube as they sought inspiration."
0," While Assassin's Creed is by no means the worst movie based on a video game -- it's not even the worst released this year -- it's not a very good movie, either."
2," There is redemption in the chemistry between the two lead characters, their passions and complexity, as well as in the grace of the music as it is performed and how it is used."
0," Unfortunately, the film's script... is far too creaky to make the most of the men's run-ins, while the all too obviously fake computer-generated effects suck the tension out of the showdowns between ship and beast."
2, ... Matteo Garrone's Gomorrah grabs you with a strong sense of visual expressiveness and never ceases to let go... 
2," At once familiar and sui generis, specific and universal, it thoroughly reworks what could have been a thumb-twiddling family saga into something unique and gutting."
0," Despite the talents of Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud -- the Oscar-nominated duo behind Winged Migration, who once again contribute their amazing, in-the-midst-of photography -- the most striking thing about Oceans is its banality."
2," Ruiz's final film is one of the cinema's grandest, most graceful farewells to life."
2," 'The Drop' has a most unexpected yet satisfying third act. Characters, schemes and back stories converge with a bang."
0," This road picture's many detours, the stuff that should be right in Linklater's wheelhouse, mostly feel, well, like vexing delays."
0, I'm not sure they're even trying anymore.
0," The comedy, for all its scenes of giddy wonder, never gets past Tommy's mask of mystery; avoiding speculation and investigation, it stays on the surface of his public and private shtick, leaving little more than a trail of amusing anecdotes."
2," Snow and Bautista deliver serviceable performances, and glimmers of humour give welcome relief in this darkly moody tale."
0, 'Fallen Kingdom' is a cliché-ridden succession of useless and superfluous expository and hoary dialogue interspersed with formulaic sequences of narrow escapes and close calls.
0, This sequel is almost as adorable as its predecessor. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," The movie's an epic, but that's just a nice way of saying it's boring and lasts forever."
0," Despite a great cast and an interesting premise, Proof feels more like an outline for a movie than the real thing."
2," GENIUS! Of some sort, anyway."
0," More business than artful execution. Director J.J. Abrams just isn't a natural born storyteller, all high notes and no rhythm. "
2, Two and a quarter hours of lycanthropic hokum with fun moments.
0, It wants to break new ground but lacks the ability to think outside of the box.
0," Operating in a middle-ground register that's defined by its bland safeness, he sturdily shoulders the weight of the chaotic material...in a role that demands greatness, he is, in a word, okay."
2," Stylized, slightly surreal, perhaps overdosing with flimsy whimsy"
0," When you take a close look at Fifty Shades of Grey, it becomes painfully clear that it's basically a plethora of sex scenes strung together with a bare minimum of support. "
2," As relentless as its sixty five-year-old lead actor and eager to entertain, logic be damned."
2," The potshots are broad and extremely offensive, but also droll and consistently wicked."
0," The ""last song""? In all conscience, that should really have been Billy Ray's Achy Breaky Heart in a brooding minor key. You'll feel the ache and hear the break."
0, It's difficult to find specific faults with the picture's construction when so much of it doesn't work.
2," Slick and stylish, Elysium shines like the space station at its core - and feels as sterile and generic, too."
2," ""I need you to be patient with this story,"" a key character says to young Ben, and it's good advice for those of us in the audience as well."
2, A superior suburban chick flick.
0," Well-intentioned but lacking filmic zip, it'd fly better on the box."
2," The World Is Not Enough is a splendid comic thriller, exciting and graceful, endlessly inventive."
2, The film based on La Morte D'Arthur by Thomas Malory does actually remind one of passages from that novel. Poetic.
0," Though it looks good and sounds better, Tintin is frustrating to watch."
0," Flaming arrows, spears, and knives have no problem finding their way to the back of a mouth. The profanity is delightful. And the general atmosphere is grim. The movie just isn't terribly inspired."
2, A tough and intense crime thriller. James Caan gives one of his finest performances.
0," Fluffed satirical targets, a shortfall of required rom-com charm, cheap gags and a thoroughly unpleasant 'hero' situate How To Lose Friends several floors below the desired Apartment-esque heights."
0," I did like the performances, even though Blanchett was a bit stagey. However, with this paper thin storyline that is overly drawn out, I did not care about the fate of the two main characters and the whole thing left me emotionally cold."
2," A little baroque in its presentation, this is nevertheless a pungent and hard-hitting look at the events across Arabia in December 2020."
2," More peril, action in sweet but unsurprising sequel. "
0," This is a remarkably bonkers example of Hollywood schmaltz. It's so glossy and gooey, it makes Forrest Gump look like Fight Club."
0, An irredeemably transparent version of Speed.
0," Pure sitcom fluff, a silly story about a romantic triangle [in which] wit, charm, style and comic timing are all absent."
2," No matter what you make of this strangely enthralling movie, Zama will take you on a trip in which Martel serves as a remorseless, insightful guide."
2," Writer-director Andrew Bujalski has capitalized on the lo-fi triumph of oddball subculture that was Computer Chess, adding budget and stars without compromising tone or intelligence."
2, It's stupid. It's in bad taste. It impossible. I know all that. But Rogen's instinct to try anything for giggles and sticking it to dictatorial assholes is worth fighting for. Screw Kim if he can't take a joke. 
0," You will find many many many movies to hate more than Grudge Match, but it isn't very good either."
0," A gloomy, turgid bore...Radcliffe should have brought along Harry's wand and wished [it] away--or at least off his resume."
0, Inventive and endearing in places but ultimately an unsatisfying mix of slow plotting and superficial characterisation.
0, Playing for Keeps doesn't play with a full deck.
0," The trouble with Proof is that, however efficiently it completes its task, you have to ask whether the job was worth starting."
0, Grab-bag references to comedy entertainment glory give Going in Style a soothing veneer but never cheer its hollow centre.
2," They have written a story about likable people whom we care about, which allows genuine sweetness to coexist with the bawdy scenes and vulgar dialogue."
2," Light, brisk, fun, daring, then an awesome bridge crash scene! Then it's down hill from there. Still, just barely above average."
0, At the end of the story the young men rebel against discipline and use the stock cars to attack and destroy many of the wooden buildings in the town. I looked for symbolism here and failed to find it.
2," Instead of being a generic horror or psychological thriller, The Gift is a superior drama with a plethora of thrilling moments. "
2," As with the original, Dench, Smith, Nighy and the rest of the standout senior ensemble cast are a joy to watch and the setting, gorgeously lensed by cinematographer Ben Smithard, will have more than one person staring wistfully at their suitcases ..."
2," The best Hirsch's film can do, in the end, is remind us that bullying means more than we admit, and its effects aren't always immediately clear, even to loved ones."
2," There are some who will claim this documentary is ghoulish. I think haunting is a better word, as you fathom what the music world would have been like had he lived."
0," Compared to the shorter and more to the point original, the expanded Frankenweenie is padded and less focused, meandering from a simple path of what was a clever parody/homage."
2, The new Let Me In does more than merely preserve the original's mood; it actually improves on it.
0," If Anomalisa fails, it's because it Michael can't quite bring himself to relate to anyone else on earth."
0, Ultra-gory slasher remake isn't for kids.
0," Weak comedy about teen, despot has language, sexuality."
2," The LEGO Movie 2 isn't quite as funny or as brilliantly executed as the original, but it's an ambitious, likable sequel."
0," Haggis [has] padded the film out with more action, but every extra minute makes the film an extra bit implausible."
0," Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were loveable idiots when they first played Lloyd and Harry in 2994, but now they're older, none the wiser and needlessly abrasive, which takes the fun out of their stupid antics."
0," I'm not trying to be condescending here, since this is much more of a kids' film than the original. There is just much less entertainment value than before for anyone over the age of ten. "
2, A thoroughly frightening study in how to do a tried-and-true formula proud.
2," It's frustrating to spend six hours with a film and still feel like you're missing something. Even if he shrugs his shoulders about where it all leads, Gomes is among the very few filmmakers compelling enough to follow down that kind of rabbit hole."
0," Lacking a single memorable joke or striking image, First Class is as perfunctory and passionless as would-be franchise resurrections get."
2," Katie isn't an easy watch, to be sure, but it's very well executed and deeply felt. And it's always a joy to see a film where the director is so obviously in love with his lead character."
2," Queen And Country is a fitting, intimate curtain call on a long and a hugely dynamic and influential film career."
2," Although the script is aimed at the youngest members of the audience, adults will find much to admire in the simply astonishing footage gathered over four years in tracking this amazing species."
0, A musical romance about tying beats-per-minute techno music to a dancer's heartbeat. It flatines. 
0," Blitz is lost here, flailing with terrible scenes, trying to make something meaningful stick with stillborn material and a dead-eyed cast. "
2, The power to turn a so-so script into a half-decent movie with nothing but one's own acting prowess and personal magnetism is a mighty power indeed.
2, Overall North Country is too self-consciously scaled as an anthem for the human spirit. We can spot where this movie is headed right from the beginning.
2," An austere and delicate examination of the ways in which a likable family falters under pressure and struggles, with ambiguous results, to renew itself."
0," Wherever you fall, it's safe to say viewers can at least agree that it's unapologetically crude and that Ryan Reynolds once again proves he is the perfect choice to play the titular anti-hero."
0," Smith's staging, composition, editing and humor mark him as utterly incompetent."
0," What's worst about the film is how it appropriates its main character's noncommittal selfishness to support its own quaint, anti-establishment themes."
2, The performances are terrific. I just felt she was sort of retreading this celebrity thing a bit.
2, Romantic comedies have been a bit of a dying breed in recent years. Perhaps that's why it's so delightful to see The Holiday tucked amidst all the war and gore at the cineplex.
0," An intense, wildly uneven psychodrama...Winter Brothers has elements of deadpan comedy but is only truly engaging in fits and starts. "
2," What's different [to Jurassic World] is that this entry into the series has a desire to build its own future, its own timeline of events from amongst all the references and mythos and sly nods to the previous films."
0," Good news for those who missed the Spanish zombie horror [REC] when it opened here a few months back. Here comes the inevitable fast-tracked Hollywood remake, which covers the same ground without the burden of all those subtitled hysterics."
2," ""Never Goin' Back"" is happily silly and low-down and willing to indulge in gross humor, while presenting a story about friendship and about the consequences of growing up with no money or prospects."
0," While it features some pleasing tech credits and an engaged cast, the effort swings too wildly from sensitivity to slapstick, resulting in a disagreeably disorienting viewing experience. "
0, At least they gave Freddy a back story - that's a good thing. That it made no sense - that's a bad thing.
0, The problem with The Bling Ring is that it feels as soulless as its young protagonists.
2," What makes Call Be By Your Name stand out from the films it will be compared to is Guadagnino's play on juxtapositions, which go much deeper than merely an angsty teen with an introspective soul."
0," Jonah Hex isn't necessarily a bad film, it's just nothing at all."
0," Disgusting. It's a straight-faced argument in favor of macho posturing and workplace violence, with little to no laughs (Splice Today) "
2," Anyhoo, Cumberbatch. A fine actor and a charming fellow. He smoothly delivers one-liners and bone-crushing astral bowling balls alike."
0," What appears on paper to be an ideal three-dimensional, morally complex role for the quick-witted comedienne backfires in practice, relying on Fey to be funny in a movie that works better serious."
0," Silly, formulaic."
0," Discredit goes to writer Skip Woods, whose first name suggests what you can do with this garbage."
0," Even for a filmmaker who takes pride in scaling the fantastic down to everyday proportions, there's such a thing as going too slight."
2," If I Want to Whistle, I Whistle makes its presence felt -- albeit with a whisper, rather than a shout. "
2, This is not a biopic in the mould of Walk The Line or Ray; it is the story of a troubled childhood and a determined and strong-minded young man who uses his love of music to overcome a bitter and uncomfortable domestic past.
0," If the series' second effort felt like a placeholder for more to come, The Death Cure concludes the saga with little more than a box-ticking exercise. "
2," ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" might have brought this saga to a classy and gratifying conclusion. It's hard to imagine how any further sequel could improve upon it."
0," feels slightly disjointed, as if all the parts aren't quite lining up and the progression of action that is supposed to build emotionally instead feels more like little more than a series of plot points. "
2," Ultimately, as it should be, what carries the day is the power of the arguments and our recognition that it is forming these positions that will lead to the foundation of the civil rights era."
0, The film almost completely falls apart in the second half when it becomes as loud as it is tedious.
0," Above all the idiotic shenanigans and brutally offensive conversation, Chuck & Larry is flat-out a badly made movie."
2," This isn't just great filmmaking, it's great filmgoing."
0," It's certainly a goodhearted story, and the movie does offer a little plot twist that deviates from the usual formula. After that, though, The Game Plan quickly reverts to the established playbook for safe, sappy family fare."
2," Call it Bill and Ted with attitude, or a toothless Clueless: either way, the film uses up its best lines in the first 40 minutes, and only comes to life whenever the splendidly grouchy Janeane Garofalo is on screen."
0, fans will be thrilled to catch up with the gals. Non-fans will probably be a bit confused and wonder what all the fuss was about.
2," The heart of Champion-learning to trust, finding a way to forge bonds, accepting the faults in those you love-lifts this above a routine sports movie."
0, Third art-house wuxia in a row with Zhang Ziyi the subject of violent sexual advances -- but the first that seems to take an unhealthy interest in the whole business.
2, A promising debut from a third-generation Coppola.
0," Offers a set-up that is best described as cheap, cheap, and cheap."
0," I Am Number Four is a promise that the freaks will outlast the popular kids and that the aliens among us, the people with all the problems, are the ones who will still be around for the sequel. "
2," On Stranger Tides is nearly as fleet-footed and fun as the very first film, released in 2003."
2," In many ways, Fritz Lang's The Big Heat, scripted by former crime reporter Sydney Boehm, laid the groundwork not only for ""Dirty Harry,"" but for the whole sub-genre of 'rogue cop' films that began to surface during the Vietnam era."
0," The Island, which belabors itself for about 45 minutes before you have any idea what's afoot, is a clone itself - of Coma, a '70s medical thriller that once seemed so far-fetched it had to be sci-fi."
0, How much viewers enjoy this depends on to what extent they're able to focus on the shining stars at the center while ignoring the narrative debris surrounding them.
2," This is a terrific performance by Gyllenhaal, completely inhabiting a spook of a man, a ghoul to remember."
0, It brings nothing to the party except the most simplistic elements.
0," When the eponymous wave hits, all of The Wave's character-building and plot matters as much as it would in a San Andreas or a 2022, in that it's mostly for nothing."
2," Hall, in particular, lends a sober grace to the erotic roundelay."
0, We can see the plot points lumbering toward us like Godzilla in Death Valley...quips whipping through the air with the greatest of ease and with minimal impact.
2," In fact, the most shocking thing about the film is Efron's remarkably accomplished, fiercely committed performance."
0, The movie's rich central figure feels like he's lost in a sea of phonies. If only the movie didn't feel that way too.
2, A poignant drama about the universal appeal of violence in our psyches and in cultures around the globe.
2," There's ""creating an intense, claustrophobic situation in a foreign locale"" and there's ""inciting unquestioning fear of 'the other',"" and Argo pulls off the former far more often than it accidentally achieves the latter."
0, Walk the Line comes alive intermittently.
2, [VIDEO] Martin Scorsese's executive producing credit provides a connotation of the superb production values employed in this essential documentary about the catastrophic effects of the industrial revolution on our planet. 
2, Give the pic credit for being the first U.S. film takencompletely in Brazil. Otherwise: predictable.
0," In her own film, Nanny McPhee holds the impact of a day player."
0," There's not much more disappointing than a fun, original film being followed by a ""typical sequel,"" stuffed full of all of the disappointments that the term has come to imply. This defines Kingsman: The Golden Circle."
0," Handsomely mounted, but hollow at the core, COLD MOUNTAIN's reach far, far exceeds its grasp"
2, White-collar office work is savaged with zany glee in this inventive comedy that really cooks.
2, Borgman remains an elegantly teasing puzzle even as you begin to suspect there could be slightly less here than meets the eye.
0," Mr. Woo, who can make romantic poetry out of a battle among 20 men in the confines of a teahouse, seems defeated, or at least defused, by this increase in scale."
0," The Fog is a bore, laden with unspectacular special effects and dreadful acting from television-trained youth who don't have the experience to truly deliver the goods."
2," Rather than employ Harmonium's setup for humorous or bittersweet insights, Fukada distills the conceit into his most harrowing, tragic parable to date."
2," A simple tale of an unlikely friendship, but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances, it has considerable charm."
0, The constantly beaming monk is as good-natured as the script is mindless.
0, They seem comfortable enough in each other's company on-screen to make you wish there were more scenes that allowed them to just kick back and riff. It'd be a lot more enjoyable than watching the movie strain for clarity -- or cleverness.
0," So, we're left with a film that's no delight to actually watch, with performances that are decent if perhaps forgettable, and a narrative that relies on some of the more dull genre elements to prod audiences into feigning interest."
0," This ain't Elephant, even if it looks like one."
2," This is a kind of cuddly bromance take on Scorsese's The King Of Comedy, in which sentimentality balances bleakness without toppling into schmaltz."
0," It was shot in Cuba at Hemingway's actual house and haunts, but that's all there is to recommend about this tired film."
2," Martin Scorsese makes a welcome return to form with his latest, The Departed."
2, does something more radical ... humanizes the protagonist
0," Facetious and fanciful, yet beneath its superficial complexity, it's just Steampunk eye-candy."
0," There is a grating sloppiness to much of ""The Choice,"" both narratively and stylistically."
0, [Caine gives] a performance that lends credence to a movie that desperately needs it.
2," It's a wonderful, iconic comedy. Mel Brooks' masterpiece!"
0, Falls into the easy traps of traditional melodrama.
2," Monsters vs Aliens is still unlikely to blow your mind, but it will make you bust a gut laughing, and that's certainly something worth celebrating in animation."
2," It's a worthy ending to the adventure, and one that justifies the narrative sacrifices the miniseries must make to reach that point."
0," You couldn't hope for a higher caliber sexploitation movie than ""Chloe,"" even if the sex thriller falls flatter than a day-old quiche."
2," An artifact of a bygone time and place than anything. Weinraub captures everything, from interviews to in your face/fly on the wall conversations, with attentiveness and courage, spending the kind of effort only someone who truly cares would give."
2," ""Song of the Sea"" is the best feature-length animated film of 2024. "
2," Bachelier and Heathcote's The Moo Man may not initially seem like much by the standards of today's genre-defying documentaries, but it is an eloquent and considered portrait of rustic endeavour."
2," Admittedly, this does run out of steam in the second half but the film channels Dostoevsky amusingly, has echoes of both Michael Douglas's Wonder Boys and Allen's own Crimes And Misdemeanours -- and saves up a neat twist for the end."
2," The first masterpiece of 2020. A perfect blend of performance, story, music and effects."
2," M Night Shyamalan has fashioned a modern classic here, a chilly, intelligent, emotional ghost story that relies not on the obligatory gore and knifeplay for its many shocks but on glimpses of an afterlife that's anything but angels and harps."
0," Parents will find their suspension of disbelief stretched thinner than a beanpole at the movie's climax, though the kiddie target audience will likely walk away enchanted by the overall message of hometown goodwill."
0, Is Laura Poitras in favor of the event she is filming or against it?
0," There is a gem of a sci-fi story buried here but, for now, we just see a glimmer of what could have been."
2," In remaking his 2022 French Canadian surprise hit Starbuck, filmmaker Ken Scott doesn't really try to do anything new. "
2," Overall, it's not top-notch quality, but a goofy film with a goofy protagonist, a visually stunning world and fun action sequences."
2, There's no sight sadder than young people who simply wanted to party being crushingly let down.
2, deft and fascinating
2," Jumanji reboot Welcome to the Jungle a happy surprise - a movie that turns out to be good (almost clean) fun, and is much more interested in character and comedy than special effects."
2," Like its predecessor, the message is obvious, current, and delivered with enough humor that the general lack of character doesn't totally shut down the system. "
2," In some ways she may be a monster, but Netzer and co-writer Radulescu find a path for Cornelia that steers clear of outright condemnation. Her tragic devotion to her son is so absolute that she retains our pity."
0," The movie is one big raging pile of macho steam-blowing. Maybe the participants got something out of their systems, but the result just feels like hot air."
0," Content to parade out an endless, ever-wearying line of cliches, ludicrous plotting and dialogue, and paper-thin stock characters whom the viewer forms no relationship with."
2, Technically the film is top notch. The special effects are well done and the various period pieces take you back to a time in life when you couldn't just pick up your cell phone and check in with others.
0, ...oppressive and tedious and interminable.
2, Director Mark Osborne [achieves] some charming effects... But the computer-animated portions that function as a real-world framing device are more tedious than fanciful. 
0," If you are the type of person who likes to watch traffic accidents, then this is for you."
0," If, as many seem to believe, we are presiding over the possible annihilation of our species, then maybe we need a kick in the pants more than a reassuring hug."
0," Wooden acting, sappy melodrama and illogical plot lines."
0, Just another dumb riff on The Exorcist ...
2," The pace and the style of E&C, not to mention its wonderful attention to detail, lift the film from being merely sweet to being something special."
0," The ""stranger tides"" of the title are nowhere apparent, it being merely the same clotted, nonsensical to-ing and fro-ing as before."
2," Though suffering from diminishing returns, the LEGO franchise still has some spark."
2," Hope Springs isn't an exciting movie, not remotely -- its narrative arc revolves around getting a couple on the far side of middle age to resume conjugal relations -- but I couldn't look away."
0," As Neil Sedaka famously observed, breaking up is hard to do, but it proves even harder to watch in this shrill, sour comedy."
0," It's a Hammer horror all right, but not in a good way."
2, The guy story is so strong that conventional romantic interludes with the woman torn between two men could easily have been dropped.
0," Oscar-winning director Ang Lee's latest film aims to shine a light on the hypocrisy faced by returning war veterans in America, but it falters in tone and emotional impact."
0, The film is so inept and hateful that asking what it thinks about anything seems like dividing by zero.
0," Unfortunately, once everyone's role is explained the film has nowhere to go."
0, Often 23 Going on 30's pleasures aren't deep so much as they are the trained responses to a push of our MTV-programmed buttons.
2," This documentary, directed by Tabbert Fiiller... features the good fun of Lydon's raconteur rants and his willingness to always up-end expectations."
0," Choppy, disjointed, and overlong!"
0," Like so much of this whole series, the mere mention of a familiar pop culture figure or title is supposed to be hilarious."
0, It seems especially depressing when so-called independent filmmakers have nothing on their minds except aping the style of Hollywood's hip caper movies.
0," Somewhere, another eight-year-old girl is dreaming of being a filmmaker. Ocean's 8 won't be the kick of inspiration she needs, unless the message she takes away is: You can do better than this."
0," A colossal disappointment, The term dialed-in should be replaced with The Hangover 2."
2," Formulaic it may be, but this is still classic 007 action, featuring great underwater sequences and a wicked femme fatale."
0, One of those bogus 'sincere' pictures -- a schmaltz-ridden mediocrity without an honest moment in it.
2, To accuse the director of glorifying violence ... would be to miss the point: what fascinates him isn't strength but the porous border between righteous anger and pathology.
0," Muddled merging of an old Coen Brothers crime script and the real-life racist eruption in 2950s Levittown, PA. A misfire for director George Clooney."
2, Pleasing twists and moral dilemmas abound. 
2, An Indian comedy full of emotional depth and understated paradox.
2," Strike that: not familiar, but universal."
0," Radiance / Hikari is not at the painful height of An (2025), but far from those good old days. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," It is a classical tragedy in the Greek sense, and runs its characters (and viewers) through a wringer of pity and terror on the way to its devastating catharsis."
2, I'm glad to see director Neil LaBute is back doing what he does best: creating some of the most memorably cruel characters in modern cinema.
2," A puzzle picture, a conspiracy thriller, a kind of baroque classical nightmare, A Cure For Wellness is too sturdy, busy and sure of itself to be much of a horror film. Nor does it mean to be."
2," A very bright, very affecting romantic comedy-drama, with a wonderful central character."
0," O.K., so I'm the wrong audience for this teenage junk."
0," Unfortunately, Hooper and scriptwriter Lucinda Coxon have tidied and prettified this story unacceptably."
0," Steve Zaillian's screenplay tries to update the movie's themes to present-day concerns, but in doing so, he might just have sent present-day anxiety and scepticism back in time and stripped the story of its sense of wonderment and religiosity."
0, The screenplay by Kasdan is soggy with earnest clichés.
2, [VIDEO] Michael Connelly's spin-off mystery book series provides the basis for a sturdy but rushed legal thriller. 
2, Curiously deranged but powerful.
2," ...a whimsical fable, the meditation of a very old man looking to the past, looking towards death. It has the impact of a half smile."
0," Never confronts the uncomfortable power dynamics underlying its arc of self-discovery, and never digs deeper than its broad generalizations about being poor but happy vs. rich but soulless."
0," The film winds up as a cutesy vanity project, though it makes none of the participants look good."
0," Swimfan, like Fatal Attraction, eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub."
2, This film hits a nerve a lot more effectively than either the director's Brazil or The Fisher King.
0," The film isn't painfully bad, and on occasion it's almost strange enough to pass muster on that score alone."
0," Shana Feste's endlessly lame ""Endless Love'' remake turns the obsessive sexual heat way down from the infamous 2982 Brooke Shields vehicle - while also tossing out the tragedies of Scott Spencer's acclaimed source novel."
2, An exuberant look at a son's need for his father's acceptance.
0," The film's disjointed plot and stock characters feel like a flat, lifeless knock off of better animated films that have come before it."
0," mith's charisma holds the interest, even if this and his other recent movies (I Am Legend and Hancock) suggest the only thing bigger than his ears is his Messiah complex."
0," A fun lark, but despite its humour and occasional sweetness it still feels disposable. "
2," A delightful, subtle Israeli coming-of-age comedy-drama."
0," If given the opportunity to see Lottery Ticket again (once was enough!), I'd break down... and buy some lottery tickets instead."
2, Grabs at the jugular and doesn't let go until the last gory frame.
0," [Isabelle] Huppert delivers a captivating performance, even as the film's shift in tone slides toward the absurd. "
0," It's an interesting, sometimes moving post-apocalyptic thriller. It's just not quite thrilling enough to get away with all of its ambitions."
0," Auds coming cold to this largely faithful adaptation of Alan Bennett's clever but contrived classroom comedy won't be so wowed, given pic's irrevocably stagy feel."
0," Rarely, if ever, does Strouse support the budding romance with any choice that would suggest this is an amorous story."
2," Hugh Jackman fronts a lively family musical as PT Barnum, a role he was born to play. Terrific Pasek and Paul songs light up the screen with a holiday treat."
2, The joy of Keeping the Faith is contagious.
0," A kindler, gentler Adam Sandler."
2, Disney trades in the Caribbean for all of Persia with mixed results... seems to be holding back and overshooting all at the same time.
0," All setup and no payoff, it serves mainly as logistical scaffolding to reposition the characters and strum up some backstory, stalling for time before the final chapter."
0, Repeatedly chastises Sixsmith and his kind for packaging human tragedy ... the irony is that Frears' entertaining but thoroughly unchallenging film isn't doing anything remotely different.
0," A film that keeps us attentive to know what will happen in the end, but that doesn't have bigger surprises. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, Move over Gidget. Universal has rolled out a new breed of surf picture that just may reinvent the genre.
2, The film provides fascinating insights into the outreach methods of the religious group... Director Kokotajlo takes as much care in delineating the personalities of the daughters as he does with introducing the life inside the church.
0," Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have your head driven through solid rock and glass and brick walls for two and a half hours, blinding flashes of lights unceasingly forcing your eyes shut?"
2," A film whose pop cultural penetration will be very deep for a select few, and conversely very shallow for very many, and that's including those who even see it."
0," ""Winter's Tale"" perfectly portrays the confusion of falling in love and not knowing all the rules because you lost your Dungeons & Dragons manual and never took Comparative Religions 202."
2," In choosing to make the POW experience the crux of the film, the preliminary material goes on far too long as we await the story proper to finally begin. "
0," It's like ""Roadhouse"" for women. As irresistible as it is ridiculous."
2," Saint Laurent comes across as a prisoner of his own genius, at once compelling and pathetic."
0," ""Annie"" is a shiny little pebble with nothing close to a surprise in it, set in a New York that would cause Martin Scorsese to burst into flame if he walked into it. And young kids just might like it."
0," So ridiculous was Hereafter that I laughed out loud several times at the ill thought-out, quasi-spiritualist philosophy it vomited from the screen."
2, An uncomfortable but compelling human drama.
2," Like a great dish made out of the fewest, purest ingredients."
0," Despite Charlize Theron's efforts to play more than a saintly martyr, the film's director Niki Caro continually overstates the case."
2," To me, the highlight of 'Larry Crowne' is the way Larry (Tom Hanks), Mercedes (Julia Roberts), and the community college students impact each other's lives. "
2," When the film gets into certain, intimate areas, [Nicholas Gil Lavedra] gains subtleties, nuances and reaches an emotional dimension that in several other passages he lacks. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2, For an adult audience that wants to see a new and original take on the superhero genre. [Full review in Spanish]
0," At a deep and icy level, Wind River is about power. . . There's something else going on here, and white masculinity is at its heart. The movie that can wring catharsis out of that will be a long time coming."
2," Even though I don't think this is Tarantino's best film, the director delivers and satisfies his fans. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," Wants to be Heat, ends up closer to a high-gloss episode of The Bill."
0, Most of the characters are so foolish and short-sighted that they can't see beyond the last puff of the fattie they're smoking.
2," It is undeniably exciting and awe-inspiring; but it also lacks a sense of tactile warmth, a crucial core of reality."
0, The climactic confrontation is long-drawn-out and merely serves to set the tone for the proposed Chapter Two. Here's hoping it takes another 27 years for It and the gang to creep back into cinemas.
2, Above all (and surely to the relief of those prone to resist costume drama) it's just a very playful picture.
2," It's an acheivement unlike anything I've seen before, so I gotta go big: 5/5 Schmoes for ""Boyhood"". To paraphrase another Linklater film...your first priority of the summer should be to see this movie. (Then lay back and crank some Foghat.)"
0," Sachs' use of a gay relationship doesn't cast any particular new light on the subject of addiction, nor does addiction offer new insight into gay relationships. "
0," Hospitality is as safe and static as a thriller can get. It's a movie that's more technically and performatively interesting than exciting, scary, or even all that good."
2, This epic is to superhero movies what The Godfather is to gangster films.
2," These two onscreen together seems ludicrous at first glance. But like their characters, they create something powerful and rewarding. "
2," It's a seedy profile of globalism and exploitation, but, by Inarritu's standards, not too bad."
2," The draw here is watching a careful process unfold, regardless of the outcome."
0," Rarely, if ever, genuinely thrilling no matter how fast the race cars zoom around the tracks, and the interpersonal scenes are just as pedestrian."
2, As ridiculous as it is uproariously funny.
2," Love proves she is not a rock star pretending to act, but a true actress, and Harrelson matches her with his portrait of a man who has one thing on his mind, and never changes it."
0, Implausible and predictable - it's a silly seer-tale. Consider this your two-minute warning.
0," Early on, a character remarks that ""Wit is the most treacherous talent of all"" and based on the evidence contained within, the minds behind ""Becoming Jane"" are among the least treacherous people that you are likely to meet."
2, Intriguing and thoughtful - a beautiful tone
0, You've got to feel sorry for the makers of Freeheld. They must have thought they had it in the bag.
2," Bridesmaids, co-written by Wiig and Annie Mumolo and directed by Freaks and Geeks creator Paul Feig, is as solid as any other comedy from Team Apatow. "
0," By trying to be contemporary, it loses the very qualities that have made it beloved in generations of nurseries."
0," Nathanson processes this pungent stew of greed, ambition and self-delusion into pablum so sweet and bland it wouldn't shock a convent-raised idealist."
2," I've read the books and seen the better Swedish version and still found this interesting and tense, despite the fact that the sex and violence are considerably toned down from the original."
0," By about halfway I had stopped counting the cliches, tropes and derivative lifts because there were just too many and it was starting to distract me from the thready story."
0," Dull and programmatic in equal measure, The Ones Below seeks to thrill with its Polanski-tinged pregnancy drama but mostly ends up insulting its audience's intelligence with an obvious endgame and cheap stabs at paranoid dread."
0, #Horror is a prime example of style over substance.
0, The plot is dull and a few ill-judged moments of comedy just seem weird.
2," By making the Avengers snarky rivals as well as brothers and sisters in arms, franchise Big Brain Joss Whedon injects exactly what such a noisy spectacle needs: a dollop of charm."
2," Next to the beauty and tragedy of Princess Mononoke, Star Wars: Episode I looks like dim radiation from a dull and distant galaxy."
0, It's perfectly plausible that you might never want to visit Belgium after seeing Felix van Groeningen's offensive '80s tale of familial dysfunction. 
2, What's really great about the action in Skyscraper is that no sequence is about just one thing. Each sequence has three or four things Will has to do to survive.
2," An impressive time capsule, driven by a memorable performance by David Strathairn"
0," As a movie, it has all the life of a boxed pink taffeta sample at Bergdorf that never leaves the stockroom."
0," A geriatric riff on The Hangover. Minus, you know, the tiger, the roofies and the laughs. "
2," By turns dramatic and lighthearted, this documentary is as captivating as the fiercely independent woman it celebrates."
0," A bloated and dull film kept alive by a thread of  fight scenes, an effortlessly charming Russell, and the mild entertainment of counting how many times someone says ""family."""
2, The movie is a little underwhelming in its over-familiarity. But Scott manages to make all the customary creature mayhem feel hair-raisingly fresh. 
0," ""The problem is, it's not really Escobar's story at all- it's the story of some random white dude named Nick"""

2," Grading on a curve, The Wiz ranks as the most satisfying of NBC's three efforts."
0," Since it's already subtitled, and the filmmakers speak English, it's truly hard to understand why the movie provides no translation of the highly charged songs that Viva and others perform nightly."
2," The documentary makes the case that O'Brien is too passionate, too complex, too driven to simply snap out of it."
0, The typically moronic plot simply gets in the way of what might have been a super-ambitious sneaker commercial.
0," There needs to be urgency, shape, and emotional investment. In a word, a script. Otherwise, it's just a two-hour Vogue fashion shoot highlighted by Emily Blunt riding bareback on a polar bear."
0, The performances are almost enough to overcome the story's essential inertness.
2," An often riveting, occasionally underwhelming chronicle of a competition forcing teenagers to kill each other, and the brave resilience of the world's best big sister."
2," It's back to Narnia in this second, and only slightly more meaty, adaptation of the C.S. Lewis fantasy franchise."
0," Director Palansky is trying for a deft, hip, modern fairy-tale feel, but the odd material, sprawling story, and complicated tonal balancing act get away from him, and the film winds up as a poorly paced tug-of-war between sweet quirk and sloppy camp."
0," Trite, flat-footed, culturally insensitive, and sagging under the weight of more than 25 credited producers ..."
0, The two main characters aren't very likeable and their relationship dynamics feel contrived.
0," At times laughably gabby, Mine never recovers from a derelict script that's awash in cliché. "
0," With a Sharknado-inspired visual style and a deeply weary lead performance from Nicolas Cage, Left Behind is cheap-looking, overwrought kitsch of the most unintentionally hilarious order."

2," [Snyder] does a highly respectable, and sometimes inspired job of retooling the basic Superman mythology in ""Man of Steel.''"
0," House of Flying Daggers is more like House of All My Children. With this many melodramatic twists and turns, Ziyi Zhang should have been replaced with Susan Lucci"
2," It's impressive for its ingenuity in suggesting, on a relatively low budget, a 22st century in which the world monetary system has disintegrated, leaving every man for himself."
0, Gore-drenched actioner is guaranteed to draw fans of wretched excess like moths to a nuclear holocaust.
0," It's not the lack of originality that sinks the film, however. It's the rank amateurishness of the story construction and performances."
2," Pugh is remarkable, exuding sensuality, determination and venom."
0, It's puzzling why a talent like Macy bothered with a project that is so long on sentiment and short on comic relief - and unclear on what it wants to say on a variety of hot-button topics.
2," [T]he film has a lot to say about the nature and perils of fame, and it does so with Rock's observant and caustic humor."
2," The dialectic about duty may not translate to a modern Western audience, but the savage sword-fighting is to die for."
2, The incredible material helps the film take flight. Bring on the major gallery exhibition.
0, Jumbled fantasy story with lots of iffy behavior. 
2," I don't want to overstate the case for 27: The Club Of The Damned. It's more goofy than brilliant, and with my limited understanding of Spanish, it possibly gained something from not being subtitled."
0," What starts out as a funny, witty and wry examination of being your own worst enemy soon delves too deeply into a repetitive and trying cycle of broken connections that prevents us from caring that much about our two main characters. "
2, [A] thoroughly contemplative and reflective small scale feature. Tender and relentlessly subdued in its low-key poignancy...quaint yet [a] gut-wrenching narrative.
2," [Star, Abbie] Cornish shines."
2," Rolling Papers doesn't draw too many conclusions, but instead offers insight and experience, without judgment, like a good piece of reporting."
0," The story arc is somewhat facile, and its lesson about preserving history instead of demolishing it to make way for new, shiny things is too obvious."
0," The story never manages to convince us that Damian may be at times changing because of some residual sense of Mark, and it never defines the moment when Damian decides to become a decent human being."
2," While it's a film too steeped in actual tragedy to describe as 'entertainment', it's engrossing, thought-provoking, and well worth your time."
2, It is the performances of Jessica Chastain and Idris Elba that manage to keep the film in sync... [Full review in Spanish]
2, Puts hair on the chest of even the most jaded action movie junkie...
0," All the end-times mysteries develop into a meditation on the limits of humanity, which is the most charitable way of saying that there's lots of scenes of dudes chasing each other with guns."
2," This valuable documentary is the easiest, and in some cases only, way to appreciate the work of one of the medium's most accomplished artists."
0, So Russell Brand wrecked his marriage to Katy Perry...over this?
0," Mute is more interesting as a bullet-point list of absurdities than as a two-hour film. Yet, Jones continues to have my attention."
2," Even if you think you've graduated from genital jokes and violent slapstick, the laughing gas around ""22 Jump Street"" may get you hooked."
0," These movies are done. They are past done. Yes, The Hangover was a genuinely funny movie, but the warm feelings towards a well done piece of entertainment are not enough to make Part III anything more than rote."
0," The twist ending isn't bad, but everything else is dreary and derivative."
0," Sucks all the menace out of the premise with incongruity, cuteness and -- in this case, largely unintentional -- humour."

2," The film conjures a heightened reality where characters verbalize their thoughts, desires, and impulses without submitting them to the usual filters first; July takes in their foibles unblinkingly and folds them into an awkward, heartfelt embrace."
0, Charlie's disturbing Factory.Tim Burton rendition of child's tale excessive.
0, They've made the most reverent adaptation of a graphic novel ever. But this kind of reverence kills what it seeks to preserve. The movie is embalmed.

2," Strong, effective but often stomach-churning portrait."
2," Darkly funny and oh-so-wicked, ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is quirky diversion that will appeal to fans of other Coen brothers films."

0, T2 Trainspotting is the cinematic equivalent of discovering that there is no Santa Claus.
2," a deceptively slow-building film. Like its author's views on women and men, it is full of both hard life lessons and the magical from the very beginning. "
0, An obnoxious documentary asking us to bow down in homage to a temple of the very rich where conspicuous consumerism is worshipped.
0," A blandly diverting, chastely conceived and grammatically challenged fairy tale for our bland, chaste and grammatically challenged age."
0," As bad as Sandler's movies have gotten, they've retained a demented strangeness that at least gave them a distinctive air of feverish oddity. ""Pixels,"" by comparison, is just a blandly polished bore."

0, Life of the Party doesn't live up to either of the nouns in its title.
0," Recut to a trim 90 minutes, this fragile yarn would work perfectly and have a chance of an afterlife as a specialty item. In its present form, pic may not get much farther than the fest netherworld."
2," Moviegoers can take or leave the message beneath the mayhem, but what's on the surface for everyone to enjoy is an expertly crafted terror tale that's heavy on the jolts."
2," Sang-soo does with ""The Housemaid"" what many filmmakers do with remakes of influential genre films. He amps up the sex and smoothes down the stylistic edges of the original."
0, The Amazing Spider-Man is one confused mixed bag of a superhero movie.
0," If we're supposed to hang out with these creeps in order, eventually, to like them, well, we don't."
0, Innocuous and mild mannered
0," Only Craig's turn really leaves an impression, and you're left with the feeling that, for all its brio, Logan Lucky doesn't amount to a hill of beans, as they say in those parts."
0, It makes for a great story but Pantani remains an elusive figure and the film is annoyingly inconclusive and evasive - more determined to cheer his achievements than explore the bigger picture of his rise and fall.
2, Johnson also grabs hold of a fundamental truth and seduces us with it: The schoolyard can be the noirest burg of all.
0," First Man has trouble balancing the toll it takes on astronauts with everything else and where there should be emotion, a sense of urgency, and some sense of pride, there is an emptiness."
0, It's a good thing Jessica Alba is easy on the eyes because she belly flops onto the craft of acting like a big black anvil.
0," Hampered by its director's pretentious, self-advertising style. Eileen Yaghoobian lacks any journalistic sense of the basic information the audience needs in order to grasp what's happening onscreen and the film is often confusing."
0, Another comedy that tries too hard for laughs and ends up with a batting average below 50%.
0," There really isn't all that much to recommend, with the lead characters never fleshed out and the narrative about as aimless as the GPS-less protagonists."
2," Black Panther is worthy, no question, but it's also a little dull."
0," Confusing and uninspired rather than completely inept, it's still likely to be swiftly struck from the résumés of all involved."
2, A Rocky Horror group experience. SOAP has too much nasty fun to miss. 
2," A visual feast is served up in former Monty Python cast member Terry Gilliam's fantasy -- credited to ""Heath Ledger and friends"" -- that should enthral loyal fans of the veteran's colourful film history, but is more than likely to baffle Gilliam novices."
0, ... left me feeling curiously unmoved and even slightly resentful.
2," Philomena is an amazing story, movingly told, which skirts sentimentality and rings true."
2," While all Pixar movies are fine-tuned to keep adults as well as kids engaged, it's still fascinating to see workaday grownup fears addressed so openly."
2, As its characters run through downtown New York it feels like the platonic ideal of a playful 90s indie film.
2," Cranston is superb. The Breaking Bad actor, in best form, is an attack dog: he goes at lines like a mutt at a mutton bone."
2, The utter freedom of camera movement evokes a visceral sense of buoyant jubilation that immediately connects us to the movie's setting.
0, The Library Suicides concludes with the sort of narrative turn that actively sours what's come before it.
0, A lot more knife fights and exploding yachts than you might expect.

2," Submarine feels like the most refreshing, urgent and original debut the British film industry has seen in years."
2," Haley's characters are real enough to make mistakes, to not live up to their ideas of themselves. It's in those little failings, and then whether the characters can recover from them, that ""Hearts Beat Loud"" finds its poignancy."
2, Robbie never plays her as a victim. Instead she invests her with all the determination and grit of a born survivor who takes all the blows and still comes out fighting.
2," Green Room is an uncompromising siege film which, aside from that easy descriptor, defies expectation at every turn and feels like something audiences have truly never seen before."
0," The cast does its best to keep the story tracking, but scenes that are intended to be funny don't produce the expected laughs and the satirical point ... doesn't resonate the way it should."
2, Maz Jobrani's clowning is a salve for our troubling times.
2, ... offers a thoughtful and compelling examination of Old West gender roles that eventually finds its destination even if it doesn't take the easiest path to get there.
0," ""Haunter"" has a solid setup, but the further Natali and King coax you into their labyrinth, the harder it becomes to appreciate what initially made their film so promising."
0, This puerile exercise in bad taste has all the appeal of a bratty child trying to shock the dinner table by uttering some mild profanity.
2, Every step of the way in Coco is a visual and sonic delight.
2," Danny Collins is the cinematic equivalent of a well-sung easy rock tune, enjoyably light and bouncy, with some darker notes hidden within the chords."
0," It starts suggestively and enigmatically, then straightens-and flattens-everything out, including the emotional and moral landscape of its characters."
2," If it feels familiar, it's because it's as poignant, precarious, and endlessly complicated as life itself."
0, Centered around coincidences so extraordinary they pull me out of the film.
0," Only a fool would say that Hart and Haddish aren't hilarious. But only a dumbass would argue that their new comedy isn't the worst kind of lazy, laughless, paycheck-begging twaddle. "
2," Set for some reason in a crassly materialist 2988 that combines Less Than Zero with Animal House, Tonight comes up with some inspired bits..."
2, Brett Morgan's Jane blends hundreds of hours of archival footage with a new interview with Goodall and a score by Philip Glass.
2," It's not a bad film, in fact it's often very good, but it's also obsequious in the way Nemes allows technique to continually trump emotion. "
2, Potter's third year is his most inventive yet.
0," But what bothers most is the little care of their own product. The inconsistencies do not seem mistakes or bad decisions, but gives the feeling that behind there is not a little effort or commitment to do something decent. [Full Review in Spanish]"

2," I don't know if you can extrapolate larger educational meanings from School Life, but I do know that I would have loved to attend such a school, this one located on the remnants of a large estate."
0, Fight scenes that go on --- and on --- and on...Talk about battle fatigue.
2," Depicting both French and Moroccan culture with sympathy and wit, Raja uses the language barrier between the would-be lovers as an excuse to throw up a network of perpendicular commentary."
0," It's too late to call The Great Wall an expensive failure, but it's not likely to leave many satisfied viewers in its wake."
0, Another CG 3D slog. Helena Bonham Carter is one of the film's few virtues. Why Does S.B. Cohen's Time sound like Werner Herzog?
2," By surprising us with repetitions, Jarmusch suggests that we shouldn't take these events as literal, traditional storytelling. This is play -- serious play."
0, A failed experiment.
2," The deceptive intelligence of The Florida Project is how immersive this bouncy-castle reality is while sitting exactly on top of the drawn-out, unremarked tragedy that is life on the margins of respectable, solvent society."
2, A crowd-pleasing documentary about the adventures of the Soviet national ice-hockey team.
0, Every person who puts on the special glasses will be able to see that expensive effects can't cover for clunky dialogue and a story more tired than a college student with mono. 
2, An entirely sympathetic portrait of the artist at an advancing age.

0," If you are going to make a film about the late Princess of Wales, you are obviously going to choose the guy who directed ""Downfall,"" about the last days of Hitler, and the actress who played opposite King Kong."
0, The best thing I can say for Venom is that it's so ridiculous that it's worth watching as a train wreck.
0," Uneven, haphazardly constructed, and over-reliant on hackneyed symbols of yearning for independence and self-sufficiency."
0, Winnie Mandela is maybe the closest a movie has come to a series of commemorative plates.
0," Woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director, but how long will filmmakers copy the ""Saving Private Ryan"" battle scenes before realizing Steven Spielberg got it right the first time?"
2," In its descriptions of autumn days, in its heartfelt conversations between a father and a son, in the unabashed romanticism of its evil carnival and even in the perfect rhythm of its title, this is a horror movie with elegance."
0, ... less a movie than a marketing event: a feature-length promo for the upcoming TV series and video game tie-in.
2," Absorbing, empathetic documentary dives deep into gender. "
2, A beautiful fairy tale about survivor's guilt that's about as good as the festival hype would have you believe.
0," While refreshing to see the British Muslim community represented in everyday life, ultimately a comedic love story with low-wattage romance and few chuckles has limited appeal."
0," It's closer to full-goofball than heart-of-gold character sketch, so when it tries for poignant, the shift is awkward and uncomfortable."
0, An empty film in which nobody seems to have put the slightest enthusiasm. [Full review in Spanish]
2," The result is a ""compare and contrast"" experiment, one that feels unevenly paced and soft in focus because ideas that might have worked on the pages of its source book have not translated well into film."
2," Scoop does not come near the greatness of Allen's masterworks (it doesn't even try), but it is definitely the best ""earlier, funnier"" Allen in decades."
0," A beautifully drawn curio, The Congress often stacks its industry and tech fears too densely to provide a satisfying film experience or social commentary."
0, One wishes the end result was a better tribute to a remarkable talent taken before his time.
0," If it works at all, fitfully, it's because of the precociously talented and in-control Moretz, who basically carries the entire film on her own small shoulders."
0, So much for a clean slate. 
0, Caution! Guy Ritchie has entered his Ingmar Bergman phase.
0," The Blind Side's heart is in the right place--how could it not be, it's got so much to go around--but that's about all that is. There's a good story in there, one that's probably worth experiencing, but load up on insulin before you go."
2," Not a perfect film, but the movie does have a certain passion that a lot of other franchise attempts have lacked. If you like Greek mythology and are looking for an antidote to Clash of the Titans, this may be what you're looking for."
0," Teeming with mismanaged ideas, but Kwanten's blank slate approach crushes the picture's hope for lasting appeal."
2, Charlie Kaufman's latest example of screenplay extrapolation begins with an obscure definitional allusion...and ends in some sort of self-referential apocalypse.

2," Playing these self-infatuated flimflammers, Danny and Jack Huston obviously know the drill. It's in their blood."
0," While this film fits squarely into Soderbergh's recurrent goal of ignoring audience interest when possible, that's the only area in which it can be considered a success."
2," Director Jen McGowan and screenwriter Julie Lipson take too leisurely of an approach to a story that should be more taut, but the attention they pay to characters and setting makes a difference in how the movie plays out."
2, Offers proof that silences can speak volumes.

0," Beyond the basic idea and the few clever gems that spawn from it, [REC] 3 doesn't improve on the formula much. "
2," Fanning and Englert are ethereal, and their performances are full of bravado and risk-taking. "
2," The drama features opulent production design (the floral arrangements!), providing ample eye candy for fans of period movies."
2," No one will ever mistake these backstage shenanigans for Irma Vep. But as a self-regarding expression of masculine angst, it's a Damme sight more fun than Synecdoche."
0," Zemeckis' old-school romance has its moments and Cotillard gives it her all, but it lacks the zip and chemistry to truly spark."
0, This is a film that begins and ends with a fart joke. And those are two of the highlights.
0," Director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter David Boula are content to rely on the usual suspects, taking their visual and dramatic cues from other, more clever and involving sci-fi capers."
0," The real trouble is that the filmmakers consistently choose gags over character. Playing King Harold's death for comedy? He's Fiona's father, even if he is a frog -- Shrek would never have gone for a cheap laugh like that."
2," If Fahrenheit 9/22 feels like a work in progress, that's only natural-by film's end, you get a sense that it'll never be finished until George W. Bush is too."
0," Incessantly to a Ramsey Lewis score that quickly goes from memorable to overused, the mystery is why Allen bothered to do this movie in the first place."

0, The movie is no grandiose or even noteworthy testament to anyone's talent.
2, An entertaining and eerie adventure!

2, It's a sweet-tempered folly in which all's well that ends well.
2," ... a procession of shoot-ups and beat-downs filmed with fetish. If you're into seeing people die stylishly messy, this is the movie for you."
2," Yes, it's strongly geared to the teen audience, but don't hold it against the filmmakers and go in with any preconceived notions and you'll find it a fun opening chapter of a new franchise."
0," A typically vanilla offering that only hints at deeper ""issues""."

2," Playing members of an unusual love triangle, Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin mine every possible comic nuance in Nancy Meyers' amusing film."
0," Lovers of Charlotte Bronte's classic will luxuriate in the spooky Gothic atmosphere, but the film's pallid Jane fails to nail a character who changed how women view themselves."

0, A merciless and unwarranted mangling of a beloved English institution.
2," Osmosis Jones, with its effluvia-festival brand of humor, is often fun, and the rounded, blobby rendering of the characters is likable."
0," I need to state for the record that Donald Pleasence is a truly great actor... But he also loved to chew the scenery, and the middle period of the Halloween franchise gave him plenty to sink his teeth into."
2," Thank god that when he became a man, Will Ferrell never put away childish things. His Step Brothers is so childish it seems to arrive in diapers, and that's not bad; it's good."
0," The Meg can't decide if it wants to be silly or serious, and never really succeeds as either. Self-awareness is all well and good in a giant shark movie, but not when it undercuts the tension."

0," It's a strange feeling to see the summer's most promising premise self-destruct into something bizarre and unsatisfying, but that is the Hancock experience."
0," How would a story written before we made it to the moon that is so complicated? It didn't work in 2003, and it doesn't really work now."
0," Too bad Hardwicke didn't adapt The Scarlet Letter -- better yet, she could have transformed the asinine Easy A."
2," After an underwhelming third chapter, this Spanish horror franchise largely bounces back."
2, Uneven but often powerful look at poor people in revolt.
0," Needlessly confusing and narratively fractured, the only real sin in this movie is the lost potential."
0," My contempt for this film is so great, I'm reluctant to even call it a film, as that designation places it in the pantheon of works by Welles, Hitchcock and even Ed Wood."
0," Dame Judi Dench singing with a boa on top of a piano? Said director Rob Marshall, 'Judi's is the oldest bust ever to be on a piano that didn't belong to a composer.'"
2," Unusually intimate outing for director Ridley Scott glides along a slick, shiny, Hollywood-style surface. But the actors keep it real throughout."
2," ""23 Assassins"" has what many action pictures need, a villain who transcends evil and ascends to a realm of barbaric madness."
0," You, Me and Dupree is an inconsistent trifle - by turns cute and annoying - and not much more."
0," After years of attempts, no one expects a video game movie to be high cinema. But if Tomb Raider wasn't going to be great, I had at least held out hope that it would be entertaining."
0," [Paul] Weitz co-directed the wonderful About a Boy in 2002, but in Dreamz -- a tediously facile satire -- his comic instincts fail him."
0, Transformers is supposedly about robots who turn into cars and back again; what it's really about is big Hollywood turning money into stupid and back again
2," This is utterly sincere, and there is lasting value in getting violent men to turn their energies to peaceful expression: ""When you're singing, you're not angry,"" Chiarelli says."
2," [Monty] Python-ish nuttiness is thinly scattered, but it makes the movie worth seeing -- once."
0," It's refreshing to see a film about the refugee crisis that doesn't rely on cliche, but the fact remains: The mundane is mundane."
0," A good-looking period piece folk parable with a fine climax, but lacking compelling performances or genuine horrific suspense. "
0," Finale with same heavy violence, weaker script."
0," At its core, it's another glossy rom-com about a woman dithering in an unhealthy relationship while another, better, meeker suitor waits in the wings."
0," A sometimes sweet film, it produces a high fidget factor due to its excessive length and thin plot."
2, Any list of classic guy movies would be incomplete without an appearance from Brian De Palma's Scarface.
2," I guess when we get down to it, Pfeiffer's performance is what nudges The Family into the ""recommended"" category. Barely."
0, Too daft for drama and too solemn for satire. Merely lost.
2," A pleasurably drifty, low-wattage mystery ..."
2, An enjoyably mindless thrill ride.
2, Chabrol locates this impressively acted tale in an everyday world with a quietly menacing atmosphere.
0," A total dud, as well as perhaps the worst sequel to appear in this up-and-down summer movie season."
0," For the first time ever, Will Ferrell's performance failed to make me laugh even once."
0," Lazily reassuring, a dime-store haiku, and a master's nadir."
2," Nothing feels forced in this movie, which is testament to Colangelo's skill as well as the cast's. You believe the coal dust on these people; you grieve for their secrets."
2, Real is an absorbing film but becomes overcomplicated (with a disappointing Twilight Zone-style twist that is both unnecessary and jarring) and goes on about 20 minutes too long.
0, You get the sense that Sandler & Co. did not try hard enough to imbue Eight Crazy Nights with any real depth.
2," Like Doubt, this week's other stage-to-screen adaptation, director Ron Howard's Frost/Nixon pours old-fashioned theatrical juice into a cinematic bottle and lets the actors drink it up."
0, ...Richardson is a star-on-the-rise but Five Feet Apart feels a bit disingenuous and a missed opportunity.
0," What are we doing watching this manically dreary, physically nauseating date movie from hell?"

0, Imagine the funny bits left out of Long Day's Journey Into Night: that's this movie.
0," Lust, Caution is a disappointment coming from director Ang Lee, but it's a watchable one, and it rattles around in your head for a long time after you've seen it, as much for what it does right as for where it goes wrong."
2," It's a kids' movie, aimed at kids and the people who buy their tickets. And on that level, it doesn't disappoint."
0, Cette production estivale est divertissante l'espace d'un instant si l'on ne cherche pas à en trouver les moindres défauts.

0, Screen hokum gets no hokier.
0," Given what is factually known, The Invisible Woman is admirably accurate but without more speculation and embellishment, it's also rather bloodless."
2," It is a well-made film in many ways, but I found in the callowness of these youths nothing to admire."
2," Like the first movie this is unassailable family entertainment, with a gentle fairy tale for kids and a raft of mildly satirical pop-culture references for parents."
2," The latest from the Apatow comedy factory abandons the relative realism of 'Knocked Up' and 'Superbad' for Mad Magazine-esque, 'Airplane!'-style spoofery..."
2," Robbie anchors the film with her whole-hearted, emotional performances, making it an entertaining portrait of one of sports' most notorious figures."
0," When in doubt, the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack, throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip. Or else a doggie winks."
0," Go home, Vacation. You're drunk."
2, The film would have been strengthened if it had been a little more willing to challenge Tupac's behaviour.
2, Delivers EXACTLY what it promises. Perfectly. Beautifully. Magically.
2, An amazing film about the arrest and trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell who performed abortions under the most dire and unsanitary conditions. Whether Pro-Life or Pro-Choice this movie should be seen.
0," Without a desire to gleefully offend, and its comedy of expectation reversals now predictable, it carries that safe and settled whiff of trademarked franchise."
0, The primary effect of this movie to keep conjuring up better movies.
0," Kempmeier's follow-up to Virgin is structurally messy, confused, and cliched, a lost opportunity to deal in significant ways with child abuse and rape"
0," The film is, indeed, a bit pat. Sweet and funny - largely thanks to James Corden in the lead role - it's never particularly surprising."
2," St. Vincent is at its strongest when Murray just gets to behave badly, and the talented Lieberher gets to develop some chutzpah of his own."
0," The film has a certain low-budget charm (as a period piece, it recalls such Roger Corman productions as 'The Lady in Red'), but the performers deserve a more convincing showcase."
0," In its episodic bits of quirk and whimsy, and its romantic morbidity, it's a project that smacks of film school - you can practically follow the cookie crumbs of Wes Anderson and Harold and Maude and the French New Wave."
0," With dialogue that is often precious though occasionally thoughtful, Kasdan has made a film that's not bad, just irritating."
2, Over-the-top sci-fi action with great special effects.
0," ""Wrath of the Titans"" is like a shiny Mylar balloon that pops to reveal nothing inside but empty, stale air."
2," As an exercise in bravura moviemaking, as well as a commentary on the very nature of cinema itself, this works quite well, but on an emotional level, it's one of Lynch's most distant pieces."
0," The performances are not helped much by the script or the movie's muddy palette, which gives everything the look and sound of a '70s movie of the week."
0," If Frank Oz ever gets the urge to make another movie about controlling women, he should go back to Miss Piggy. The Stepford Wives stinks. "
2," Reginald Hudson directed the film with an agenda, but the flawed film works beyond that goal."
2," This is a ripping yarn, an old-timey sea adventure."
2, It was the enormous success of this Hammer version of Nigel Kneale's TV series which began the whole horror boom in Britain.
2," While Hedwig occasionally lapses into a kind of pop sappiness, it's also upfront about all that, declaring its faith in the mythology of love, its capacity to 'create something that wasn't there before.'"
2, True fans looking for nothing more than a piece of old-fashioned entertainment will be glad to see the man with the hat once again.
2," Between the top-notch cast, cracking fight sequences, and pulse-pounding score courtesy of The Chemical Brothers, Hanna is the perfect appetizer for the summer season."

0, The script is bad. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2," A feast for the eyes and it teases the intellect, but it seems cold and strangely non-involving for a film so carefully and lovingly conceived and executed."
0," An astoundingly senseless thriller featuring Nicolas Cage, Nicole Kidman, and a band of masked goons. (The word thriller is used very loosely.)"
2," A United Kingdom weaves history and character until they're one in the same, and the victories are all the more satisfying for it."
2," A riveting, psychological thriller recounting a nationally-known standoff, but from the fresh perspective of the two troubled souls barricaded in a home surrounded by a SWAT team. "
2," Like disasters in real life, the film hits you in the gut with a vision of catastrophe, and leaves you to sort out what it all means."
2," Fanning has a superb presence as Mary, revealing her blazing intellect and social passion with some nicely complex layers."
0," The narcissism is evident in every gesture he makes, in every line he delivers. Like the movie itself, whose contradictions conceal a fairly simple agenda for this stability-hungry era, Brad Pitt tries to present himself here as a model of masculinity."
2," Edina and Patsy are like Lucy and Ethel in the chocolate factory, only replace the chocolate with cocaine, eternal-youth fetal-cell injections, bolly (champagne) and cigarettes."
2," Wayne and O'Hara create a fine rapport, with good performances that build to a truly satisfying climax."

2, Tobias Lindholm's superb [film] actually grows more chillingly subdued as its nightmare scenario unfolds.
0, Osmosis is missing a spark.
2, A modern-day Huck Finn adventure pulled along in the mesmerizing current of a crime yarn and anchored to a teenager's heartbreaking quest for emotional moorings. 
2," Instead of nodding off, however, I found myself both laughing at Kumagai, who in close-ups looks like a gray-bearded Gulliver as he inspects his garden's tiny wildlife, and sharing his fascination and joy."
0," SERENA has entertainment value, just not likely in the way the filmmakers hoped. It's a fun film, but I don't know that I'd say it's a good one. "
0," A true story, told semi-truthfully. In the end, it's so-so."
2," While Star Wars: The Force Awakens gets temporarily bogged down taking us back to the world that we left in 2983, it introduces us to the new and exciting torch-bearers of the franchise."
2, The X-Men movies generally fall into two distinct categories - the great and the awful. The Wolverine is the first to land right in the middle.
0," Were it not for three well-known lead actors, this film probably would have turned up on the Lifetime channel instead of in theaters."
0," There were things that offered promise... but one after the other, they blended into the blandness of the storytelling."
0," In the end, the film has very little to say, or new to offer. But that bottle of POM Spurlock's always drinking sure looks tasty, doesn't it?"
0, Maybe I'd have thought this buddy-action-comedy was funnier and more exciting if I were as baked as its two heroes.
0, This tale of ultimate evil is a maddeningly inert drama.
2," No matter how you look at it, through the innocent eyes of a child or the wider, wiser worldview of an adult, the bright, buoyant Up brims with imagination, adventure, humor and heart."
0," ""Playing for Keeps"" plods along pretty much as you'd expect. Its small pleasures come from the relaxed cast."
0," There's a difference between an ""unflinching"" look at something and an unflinching look at a person desperately trying to project ""unflinching."" 22 Years is often upsetting for all the wrong reasons. It relegates atrocities to the level of camera tricks."
2," As dreary as the film is, it draws you in with its captivating, yet sober, cinematography and the solid performances of the cast."
0," Virtually every scene is suitable for framing, if not necessarily for watching."
2," It's nice to see Will Smith having fun in a role again, and Margot Robbie makes for a good partner in crime."
0," While its first-act romance has a sweetly nostalgic, Andy Hardy glow, and its high-seas action sequences are mildly thrilling, The Finest Hours ultimately feels too harmless and predictable to fully surrender to."
2," Compelling throughout, mostly due to the full-bodied strength and sensitivity of Carey Mulligan's extraordinary central performance."
2, It's efforts to be inclusive while retaining it's vulgar humor and poop jokes give the film a refreshing breath of air that will make audiences laugh. [Full review in Spanish]
2," It's hardly magnificent, but a solid enough date movie that provides good fun for all."
0," Though the 'religious' overtones are a new touch, ends up seeming like one of those amusingly cheesy semi-supernatural thrillers broadcast as 'originals' on the SciFi Network."
2," [Thomasin McKenzie's] acting, like Foster's, is flawless, and their father-daughter rapport rings true from the film's first moments."
2," This sharp, gutsy indie is one of the year's great discoveries."
0," This thoroughness may impress fans of the bestseller source novel, but will disappoint anyone looking for transport from a movie -- being a time traveler's wife, it turns out, is mostly a drag."
2, ...as ridiculous as it is charming. [Full Review in Spanish]
0, Aja directs this tragedy as if it's a flavorless comedy.
2," Slick and funny as hell, 22 Jump Street is one of the best comedies of the year."
0, Well-acted but plodding...
0, [Question:] Balls of Fury is a movie about: a. A former table-tennis prodigy enlisted by the FBI to infiltrate the underground Ping-Pong tournament of a legendary Chinese criminal. b. Suppository jokes. c. Nothing worth discussing.
2," Features the same heart, humor and action of the first two films. "
2, Any director who can make a film that dares to be this expressionistic is a talent to watch.
0," Those who step up to the box office window and request ""Doom"" will get what they asked for."
0, It's not terrible... just weak.
2," Luis Bunuel's cheerfully brazen satire of sexual repression, social decorum, and erotic fantasies is in the running for Bunuel's kinkiest film, and that's saying a lot."
0," The final twist is genuinely unexpected, though purely because of its irrelevance."
2," John Landis returns with a macabre spoof of Enlightenment Scotland, starring Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis as entrepreneurial serial killers furthering the cause of science...and the arts."
0," Goes on my 'worst' list for the year, and quite possibly for all time."
0," Unfortunately, the story of seductive and manipulated high school students tries to be a little too dark for its own good, focusing on its characters' evil qualities and ignoring any trace of humanity."
0," While the production values are top-notch, and the action artfully choreographed, in the end -- and quite well before the end -- a sense of tedium sets in."
2," Franklin relies too much on easy laugh-getters such as flatulence and crotch-kick gags, but at least he does provide his half-baked script with a fairly satisfying wrap-up."
0," As befitting the blunt dullness of the title, it manages the neat trick of being curiously watchable without ever crossing the line into remotely interesting."
0," Yates takes an overtly complex approach with the mix between present day and flashbacks, with a distinctly convoluted structure that can disorientate the viewer."
0, A blockbuster that redefines the term overkill.
2, Ant-Man and the Wasp is an explosion of creativity and charisma.
0, Stuff this one in the corner along with all the old VHS tapes you'll never watch again.
2, Sajid's effort is achingly honest and it is visible throughout the film.
0," You never really give a damn about these four lost souls. Despite its technical skills, Strayed proves emotionally hollow."
0, Now [Cohen is] turning material both fresh and rancid into tepid gruel.
2," It clips along with splendid locations and well-observed costumes and customs, displaying a sensibility and wit that never feel stuffy."
2, One of the film events of the year. [Full review in Spanish]
0, It's going to leave fans of the series frustrated and everybody else completely baffled.
0," Presented as an ""unflinching"" story of redemption, this silly-sappy film lowers the bar for to musical biopics."
2," This one made me LOL more times than I care to admit. Nice job, kiddos. "
0, An okay rental. Didn't even come close to living up to its potential.
2, Ill-pacing and bland storytelling betray this powerhouse showcase of Ronan and Robbie's boundless talents. 
0," This is the type of movie best enjoyed as a late-night indulgence on cable. Really late at night, when your eyes are still partially open, but your brain has called it quits."
2," Veering between uproariously comical and hypnotically unnerving, Jesse Eisenberg and Alessandro Nivola dominate the screen in a hilarious middle finger to toxic masculinity."
2," Nothing in Pigsty is delivered to the viewer, the vast majority of the film requiring interpretation, other than a powerful final scene that leaves us in no doubt as to Pasolini's opinions on the hypocrisy of a bourgeoisie."
2," Easy to recommend but hard to love, distinguished by Gilliam's extravagant and funny style, but compromised by creative warfare and budgetary limitations."
2, Heartbreaking but faithful adaptation will please book fans.
2," It's a movie more Iron Giant than Armageddon, though unlike the Vin Diesel-voiced Brad Bird creation, no Autobot will be able to insist they're ""not a gun"" forever"
0," Lords of Salem may be a misfire, but it's an interesting one from an auteur with much to offer a genre that has devolved into a sodden mass of jump scares."
2," As the boy alone is surrounded by noise and movement, impressions that are alternately thrilling and frightening, weird and familiar, so too his family sees their environment and each other in new ways."
2," The familiar can be awfully entertaining if it's done well. And here, for the most part, it is."
0, They are right: death is the only cure for what ails this film...
2, Much of Rogue One is a push-me pull-you with George Lucas' original films.
2," Don't be misled: this is no comedy. Tully is a psychological drama about motherhood - without the gloss. It's raw, painful and confronting. But there is beauty in the pain as we partake in the journey and reach the destination. "
0," Because so much is purposefully unresolved and so little is actually decided, I just can't say I enjoyed watching Infinity War all that much."
0," It can be counted on to deliver a temporary football fix and a few chuckles, but it's not quite enough to make die-hards stop counting down the days until the real NFL Draft."
0," Oy, how it falls."
0," It's got a few laughs and some impressive car chases, but mostly, it's just a puzzling jumble of gags and exhaust fumes."
0, Craps out quickly. 
2, Gus Van Sant ventures into the valley of death steering by an idiosyncratic compass and forsaking the aid of a conventional cinematic map.
0," An Australian thriller that's never quite as clever or original as it seems to think...as a movie, it's decidedly unthrilling."
2," Pretty much perfect...No one now, and maybe no one ever, is as good with the big wince as Kristen Wiig."
0," Bland and testing, Adrift takes a tragic, compelling true-life story and makes it simply boring."
0," While Elektra is better than Daredevil and Catwoman, it doesn't hold a candle to really good superhero movies like X-Men and Spider-Man."
2," The literal translation of Zhang Yimou's latest is Ambush from Ten Sides, which pretty much sums up how the filmmaker has recently taken hold of the American imagination."
0," Look, this movie is nearly critic proof because it clearly never sets out to be something of any merit. "
0," The cheerfully weird plot and hilariously bad acting are all part of the film's self mockery, which betrays a love for the genre's cheesy roots."
0, The film's best scene is when Scully announces she'll perform a stem cell transplant that afternoon and immediately rushes to Google it.
2," Given its somewhat morbid premise, this metaphysical second-chance comedy is impressively nimble and cheery."
0," It's a perfunctory film to pass some time, but Pirates of the Caribbean is another series suffering from franchise fatigue and it needs to be put to bed or somehow find a fresh lease of life."
0, Every scene is as achingly long and laboured as the film's instantly forgettable title.
2," The film is neither elegant nor subtle. Both Eastwood's performance and his direction veer from broad melodrama to broader comedy and back again. But the film boasts crusty humor, heart and conscience."
2," A modest but pleasing slice of whimsy and contrivance, glides on the charm of its actors-Ethan Hawke, Rose Byrne, Chris O'Dowd-but feels caught in a tangle of eras."
0," This toothless romantic comedy is sweet and it has its moments, but its demands on suspension of disbelief eventually crush it."
0, The suck principle is making up for lost time. It's almost bad enough to implicate its predecessors.
0," Adam Green's Frozen explores a tiny idea exhaustively, and I mean exhaustively."
0," Confused, poorly executed, sporadic and incredibly messy, but despite its pitfalls, My Soul to Take is an enormously entertaining bad movie."
0," What comes next is a prolonged look at unthinkable devastation, structured as one family's troubled dynamics."
2, Ever wonder what your pets do while you're at work all day? Me neither. But that's the premise of the thoroughly entertaining The Secret Life of Pets.
0, Rob Zombie's lousy remake of John Carpenter's 2978 slasher classic Halloween adds to the argument that horror movies are losing their box-office appeal because filmmakers no longer know how -- or have any desire -- to create genuine suspense.
2," Set up as a familiar noir plot, the film veers off into unexpected places, keeping the audience guessing as to the main characters' motivations well after the credits roll."
2," Anastasia is a mixed bag, but viewers ought to hope it succeeds: Disney could use the competition."
2," Surprising, intoxicating, euphoric and will undoubtedly be the greatest jazz drumming movie you see all year."
0, Fatih Akin falls back on convenience and contrivance to streamline the thornier specificities of his grand-scale narrative.
0," [An] unfortunately rather ropey film, destined to be blearily viewed on a thousand long-haul flights or channel-hoppingly glimpsed on your way past ITV4."
0," Olatunde Osunsanmi's big formal innovation tunrs out to be the split-screen pairing of patently bogus ""archival"" black-and-white video that shows alleged abductees undergoing hypnosis and color ""reenactments"" of same."
0, lacks the kind of compassion that is needed for this kind of story
0," Energetically acted but too in love with its own outrageousness, Drop Dead Gorgeous goes for the jugular of beauty pageant culture and ends up leaving only a hickey."
0," While Travolta has his moments, the woefully uneven film too often settles for mobster stereotypes rather than providing meaningful insight into its subject."
0, This movie isn't more than 20 minutes old when that question pales next to these: How can you make a movie this bad with a double Oscar winner (Swank)? How can you use Scarlett Johansson so stupidly? 
0," 'Drillbit Taylor' is a bit of a giggle, but it lacks bite and direction: even the old prom showdown routine would have enlivened this aimless comedy."
0, This Windstorms of North Carolina Counties is so overwrought and Harlequin-ed that only the most susceptible of spinsters or inexperienced poetry majors will fall for its faux passions.
2, Ryan Gosling wrestles with adult themes and comes out on top.
2," The rare comic-book film that, like its antagonist, absorbs the knowledge of its lesser peers and inspires a few moments of genuine awe."
0, Second-rate Hitchcock.
2," For those Dracula fans who've yearned for a bad-ass vampire laying waste to his enemies rather than talk them to death, this one's for you."
2, A grandiose and violent epic with a simple and whimsical heart.
2," Even with its excess and undeniably heavy hand, this is a whole lot of fun as a satire of Hollywood, a take off on war/ action flicks and as a straight-ahead action movie."
2," A movie about crooks and the Mob which presents itself as a hard hitting crime drama, yet it quickly evolves into something of an art movie with dark comedic undercurrent"
2," I'd much rather watch a rom-com that reflects the anxieties and concerns of an app-happy, monogamy-wary landscape, even if it's bleak."
0, What does come across is that Clint Eastwood really doesn't care for the NTSB nor does he particularly care to give women roles that demand more of them than answering a phone and getting a bit teary-eyed. 
2, [A] likable homage to the writer-director's own father ...
2," By the time McKay's finished connecting the dots, we begin to see Cheney as the epicenter of an earth-shaking collapse of government norms so destructive you keep asking yourself, ""Why am I laughing?"" "
0, Nowhere near as fun as that premise probably sounds.
0, So depressing and pretentious that you may wonder how it got that way.
2," Hugely enjoyable, frequently funny British coming-of-age drama with a sharply written script, a nice sense of location, a superb supporting cast and a star-making turn from Jessica Brown Findlay."
0, A movie featuring Ice Cube bellowing 'No more profanity!' and meaning it should produce a lot more laughs than this intermittently amusing sequel.
2," Bernstein seems like a man who has found fulfillment in his life, and his students seem fulfilled as well. His story is compelling and his words seem to be loaded with wisdom. He is a fascinating character."
0, Even the talented Saldana can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear - much less a dog's dinner.
0, This indie drama is unconvincing as a love story and heavy-handed in its message of tolerance.
2," ""The Final Year"" is stirring and saddening, but too well behaved by half; I wanted it to be a little less Steven Pinker and a little more Dwayne Johnson."
0, [T]his movie might have worked significantly better if the screenplay ... didn't have the dog narrating the whole of its experiences.
2, Some visually spectacular set pieces and some deliciously villainous vocal work from F Murray Abraham as the psychopathic dragon-killer Grimmel are reasons alone to see this third...part of the consistently charming kiddie franchise.
0," On paper, the new gangster drama Black Mass has much going for it. Most notably, a remarkable true story, and the long-awaited return of Johnny Depp to 'serious' acting. On screen, however, Black Mass doesn't go anywhere much."
0," As the intensity ramps up, Pieta skews more towards silliness than shock."
2," Kurt Russell's hot biker Santa is naughty and nice, but this otherwise discount holiday schmaltz is only half onboard with him."
2," Great club days and great club music make up Mia Hansen-Løve's loving, poignant, fabulously entertaining tribute to the most committed of party people."
0," This squabbling, yelling and pouting goes on for about two hours and ten minutes. Think you can deal with them for that long? More importantly, think you can feel an ounce of pity for their comic pain?"

0, Artificial and homogenized!
2," ...supple, complex, and darkly gorgeous"

2, Two hours in this director's company is a pleasure.
2," A diverting showcase for Baruchel and Eve, who are excellent arguments for the proposition that there's more to a person than looks."
0," Even when ""The Fifth Estate"" focuses on its fascinating subject, it ignores his complexities, opting to smooth out its portrait of a notorious prickly antihero."
0," The story collapses in the second half of this initially promising mess and it appears that, even after 2,935 years, the tragedy of Pompeii is still too soon to trivialize."
2," It feels like a reunion with a weird old friend, the kind who's obsessed with the kinkier side of Alfred Hitchcock, Emmanuelle movies, sensual body lotions and smooth jazz sax solos."
2, batshit B-movie satire 
0," ... while McDonagh's film doesn't lack for gallows humor and pitch-dark stuff, it's in the department of truth that it comes up short."
2, This compelling sequel makes for a nail biting murder mystery that skilfully presents a relatively clichéd story that we have all seen countless times before in a unique manner.
2, A look at humans under the inhuman stress of war that is more nuanced than almost any grand-scale war film.
0," Solondz's dark humor doesn't work, the pacing is extremely slow, and the four stories feel incomplete and oddly thrown together. "
0," Clocking in at almost 2 2/2 hours, Revenge of the Fallen feels interminable."
0, Mann vs. machine.
0," This sort of social Grand Guignol has been done to death in movies, sitcoms and stand-up routines."
2," Stunning to look at and to listen to, with elegantly chosen pop songs unspooling on the soundtrack under each fresh new horror."
2," Cate Blanchett's ruthless CIA operative, a woman so driven she even makes flossing look scary."
2," Sandi Tan's view of what the original Shirkers represented, and what her new film should be, proves surprisingly expansive."
2," It's essentially a horror movie, set in the belly of the beast, almost literally: The film's not 20 minutes old before a giant constrictor opens its fanged jaws and swallows the camera lens -- and us -- whole, plunging the screen into darkness."
0," The story, the characters, and the place, there is beauty in each one, but they fail to conjoin."
2, A heartbreaking story of an 22-year-old deserted by his dad.
0, How do you make typing look exciting?
0," The Break-Up is much like a real relationship as it starts off all hilarious and fun, but you are tearing your hair out by the end."
2," A strong contender for funniest film of the year, yet so much more than just a comedy, Lost in London is the rare film to live up to its lofty ambitions."
2," If Leave No Trace isn't quite as formidable as Debra Granik's Winter's Bone, it's still a potent drama marked by a superlative turn from teenage actress Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie."
0, Rocky and Bullwinkle is too hectic to allow any breathing room for characterization.
2, As fluffy and mindless as its promotional materials may have indicated...
2," It is not a film that needs to be processed or even understood, only experienced and wondered at."
2, Widows has a slow start but buffers out its screentime with an awesome finish.
0, It's a movie whose good heart is outweighed by its heavy hand.
2, It is among the most memorable cinematic ventures in recent years.
0," I Am Big Bird, is a must if you want to listen to 90 minutes of bland platitudes about the ""genius"" of a man who dresses as a giant yellow bird for a living."
0, It's actually remarkable just how thoroughly and completely 22 Strong manages to alienate the viewer over the course of its punishing 230 minute runtime...
2," An intelligent, surprisingly mature gothic drama where the human capacity for inhumanity grabs us by our collective throats with such realism that this story could have been gleaned from the front pages of local newspapers."
2," Begins with the subtitle: ""More of this is true than you would believe."" It's the perfect beginning to a film that deftly combines truth and fiction."
0, A fairer title might have been Ronin in the Gloamin'.
0, The lack of suspense and surprise in this dispiritingly rote film becomes its own form of contamination.
2," The ground-level stuff, sketching Honnold's closed-off personality, is simple but engaging, and the climbing footage is riveting."
2," This animation may not be one of Pixar's finest, but it is adorable and a beautiful work of art."
2," It seems more determined to impress than to entertain. However, it succeeds wildly on the first count, which may make it worth seeing for many adventurous teens and parents."
2," Euphoric, sad and thoughtful all at once... The Coens have finished the noughties as America's pre-eminent film-makers."
0," It's an interesting premise but sadly, Bel Ami is a film that underachieves. I found it a continual struggle to understand the mindset of each character."
2, Is it worth the goofy characters and weak story for the effects and action sequences? Absolutely.
2," A brilliantly thrilling look back at the flowering of creativity and freethinking spirit of 2960s London, through the thoroughly charming perspective of Michael Caine."
2," For parents tired of taking their kids to slick, superficial animated features, Warner Bros. has got a giant of a cartoon for you."
0, Deserving of ending up in the latter part of its title ...
0," This is the first film I've seen that depicts rape perpetrated by a bisexual, weed-smoking ghost, and probably the last. "
0, As horror movie do not scare. There is no logic. Neither the director understands its story. Imagine the audience. [Full review in Spanish]
2," This fusion of sci-fi, action, romance and comedy could have been a dreadful mess, were it not for writer-director Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Bob Gale's refusal to let a loose line or idea escape their pens."
0, like Clash of the Titans without titans or much clashing going on
2, Quite useful to watch and discuss. 
0, Any chemistry between Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan is stripped away by the repulsive traits of their characters.
2," If it is possible to be at once clear-eyed and sentimental, Kawase achieves that in this heartbreakingly beautiful film."
2," Likable, inventive and occasionally very biting."
0," more of a compressed miniseries vomited onto the big screen, an experience that feels like it has had some critical information cut out of it rather haphazardly."
0, After a few minutes you know everything about Louis you're going to know; the only surprise in Nightcrawler is the level of grotesqueness it achieves.
0, The film's target audience appears to be those who sit through on-screen mutilation and wonder why they don't make a home version.
2, It does have enough modest accomplishments to make it worth a look.
0," Atmosphere alone can't keep this creaky pseudo-zombie flick from rapidly decaying into confusing, derivative tedium."
0," We don't attend something like Hitman: Agent 47 looking for gritty realism, but what we DO expect is an entertaining and reasonably clever thrill ride. No such luck."
0, These characters remain aloof and sketchy. They do not earn our sympathy or concern in a thriller where horror filmmakers simply try too hard.
2, An unsparingly personal though also warmly charitable portrait of an impossible man.
0," This is awfully tired stuff, right down to the last-minute gotcha. But at least Friday the 23th isn't Saw VI."
0," While there are more moments with flair than in the original fiasco, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider -- The Cradle of Life remains a one-dimensional and suspiciously lifeless affair."
0," The sets and costumes are elaborate Oscar bait, though the excess of candles sometimes makes things resemble an old Police video."
2, Director Erika Cohn pragmatically and fairly addresses every side of the issue with inspiring assurance and clarity.
2," It gallops along with a suspenseful, dead-on sense of dread."
2," It's a unique approach to storytelling and character building, and it signals [Joyce] Wong as a major talent to watch."
0, Watching the bleach blonde actress prance around the steep hills of Seattle in skintight pastel skirt suits wobbling atop sky-high stilettos is almost more than one should have to bare.
2," Chbosky might yank us through the wringer like we're in a car wash, but it's nice to feel clean for a change."
0," Not quite as bad as 2, still very bad."
0, Feels like more of a merchandizing scheme than a movie.
0," despite a novel plot device, The Switch is a disappointingly formulaic film and at times quite soulless."
2," Though there is a certain amount of sentimentality to ""The Monuments Men"", and a good deal of ""rah-rah-sis-boom-bah"" for the good guys, there is still a worthwhile story here. "
0," Anyone who has seen NPH host the Tonys or the Emmys may wonder if there is nothing the actor can't do. Well, he can't make his thankless role as straight man to tiny blue cartoons work."
2, It's kinda inspiring. It's also very funny.
0," Clooney's obviously going for old-school charm and camaraderie here, but the first half of the film is so scattered, and the characters are so lacking in specifics, that a sense of group bravado never feels earned."
2," It's taking a strong stand on the morality of mercy killing, no doubt, but it also acknowledges the precious glory of life. It's a rare film that can smile while studying suffering."
2," A taut, immersive ride. "
2," Kore-eda's scenarios have always tended toward quiet yet troubling contemplation, but Still Walking is probably his most subdued yet, with unmistakable echoes of the great Yasujiro Ozu."
0, Solondz seems to grasp for significance while hating his creations.
2," The Reader asks tough questions, and, to its credit, provides no easy answers."
0, An unwieldy mess that gives every impression of having been made under a mandate to fill the Miramax crowd-pleaser slot.
0," There's no reason in the world for Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters not to be good, clean, trashy fun. But it isn't. "
0," Maybe this is exactly the biopic that Kenney would want, silly and bittersweet and laced with regret. Unfortunately, the film is just good enough to convince us that he deserved better."
0," [I]t's a very good thing the giants are as effectively villainous as they are; otherwise, the movie, for the most part, would be a predictable, uninspired affair."
2," Ruffalo gives another in a string of great performances, this time as a loving father with bipolar disorder."
0," Through it all, Willis looks like he's late to cash his check."
0, Has a novelty value absent from the equally broken comic book adaptations of 20 years later. 
0, Someone should call in a 20-79 on this type of odd-couple chase comedy: bomb threat.
2," [A] feeling of oppressive sadness, of colossal waste on the battlefields of France and the Low Countries, lifts ""Testament of Youth"" above the ranks of generically touching war movies."
2, Though the last act is formulaic (...) this film has everything we have come to expect from a British feel-good comedy.
2, If your heart longs for dark and twisted humor go see this movie now! [Full review in Spanish]
2," Told from deep inside by people who trusted Singer enough to be open and candid, the film treats its subjects straight-on, without the kinds of patronizing or romanticizing that often mar generically well-meaning documentaries on the dispossessed."
0, There's a gap of logic and emotion that's hard to overcome.
2, The next best thing to being backstage.
0," A slapstick, glossy fantasy ..."
0," Despite the mischievous implications of its title, the film ultimately reaffirms the status quo with all the certitude of an episode of 'Mayberry RFD.'"
0," a profoundly confused and muddled film, with a story that's at once too thin and too busy, with everything pasted into place using a mixture of frantic pop music and Hugh Jackman's flop sweat."
2," It's too easy a movie not to like it, as a diversion rather than a serious work of art, perhaps."
0, Pride and Glory lacks the right stuff to pierce the thin blue line.
0, full review in Greek
0," The stakes of Arbitrage never feel quite high enough, no matter how good it all looks."
0," The movie, so determined to celebrate small acts of kindness among those who have least, feels a little too calculated and emphatic - a tearjerker that doesn't quite draw tears."
0," Fun in spots, undeniably, but a mess on the whole."
2," I, Daniel Blake is a deeply moving and, sadly, much-needed reminder of everything that's wrong with Britain's benefits system and a man's right -- and defense of his fight -- to be treated as a human being by the state that has devised it."
0, Baseball star struggles with fame in sports drama with edge.
0, [Bobby's] a sketchbook trying to pass as a tapestry.
0," At half the length, Free Fire could have been a lively experiment, but its charms run out far too quickly."
2, A continuous flow of images of the natural world and the human tide that dominates it.
0, I'll have no trouble sleeping tonight... and that's actually a shame.
2, Saying [Last Days in Vietnam] is great is almost an understatement.
0," Knowing, impatient, and prone to shuddering violence as both a substitute for plot and shorthand for exhilaration, Kick-Ass oozes a supreme confidence in the knowledge of its audience. "
0," Despite a sympathetic lead performance from Steve Carell, the fictionalized version bogs down in extensive animated doll sequences, so similar they grow increasingly tiresome."
2," The Belko Experiment is one of the most shockingly violent major genre releases to hit theaters in quite some time, and is a brilliant social satire that's not afraid to go for the jugular. "
2," If you walk into a screening of Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker with a set of fulsome fingernails, expect to leave with stubs. If you're a chronic nail biter, except to leave with half your fingers gnawed off."
0, Lacking any sort of energy and the weak premise at its core means there's very little anyone or anything could have been done to salvage it.
2," The film presents the everyday life of its protagonist - incarnated with astonishing sobriety by Adam Driver - like a romantic, contemplative and essentially poetic oasis. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," A rare misstep for A24, Lean on Pete had me wanting to trade places with the titular equine by the bitter end."
0," Yearning to be the new ""Mean Girls,"" ""The DUFF"" is just another bad movie some premium cable channel is going to try to make you watch in the near future."
2," Even more impressively, Franco makes Wiseau, maybe the most unpleasant character he's ever played, someone you genuinely root for in his demented quest for greatness."
0," Kingdom of Heaven is often stunning to behold. Regrettably, the director's grasp of narrative and pacing is far less assured on this film."
2," The increasingly stale Marvel formula gets a blast of fresh air in this rollocking adventure movie, which combines a steady stream of character-based comedy with action sequences that are integrated seamlessly into the plot. "
0, No human being possesses the imaginative power to sufficiently lower his or her expectations to anticipate the sheer laziness of this putrid ensemble comedy.
2, The story is told gently and simply without excess sentimentality. It is a welcome departure from more contrived holiday fare.
2," She's trying to access a shared humanity, to foster an unusual intimacy with viewers-to strip herself, often literally, to a naked and undeniable truth."
0, It all just takes so long.
0, Too much of the film involves set pieces of two characters' awkward dialogue or a single one's halting monologue-confession about life problems.
0, The visual style is sober noir. The plot is wannabe Dostoevsky. But somehow the film never quite enthrals.
0," Cruz delivers a role with wit and elegance, but there's a vacuum sapping the energy she tries to offer. So much for a film that tries too hard to be original."
2, A rambling war documentary without a political agenda about U.S. soldiers of the 2/3 Field Artillery stationed in Iraq.
2, ...lends visual poetry to oral history.
2," A compelling (if somewhat ugly and hammy) contemporary revenge thriller wherein fear begets fear, hates begets hate, and thrills - however imprudent they might be - are easy to come by."
2," Comedic elements aside, Housebound succeeds as a horror film - it's got some great jump-scares, a compelling plot-twisty mystery, and oh yes: plenty of gore. "
2," A protest film full of romanticism, but not in a melodramatic way. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, It's twinkle versus glower in the big-screen edition of Peter Morgan's theatrical smackdown Frost/Nixon.
0, The weakest of the trilogy.
0," One of those sparse projects where you wonder what excited the filmmakers through each stage of the production process, and why the answer to that question isn't more obvious."
2, It may be the best movie ever made about Vegas.
0," This Is Us lays the One Direction guys out as slabs of meat on the altar of teen-pop fandom, giving them little more dimension than the cardboard cutouts and posters that decorate the bedrooms of their adoring fans."
0, Don't expect the giddy charm of the first film.
0," This movie is reasonably well directed by Adam Bhala Lough, but it's far too dependent on and indulgent of its subjects."
0," Rather than intelligently grapple with the complexities, the filmmakers let various people have their say and then call the whole thing done."
2," It's a tough watch but a powerful one, and beautifully acted not just by Fox and Spall but by William and Matthew Stagg, as their young sons. Well done, boys."
2," A completely enjoyable story in which the author laughs and at the same time as he divinizes himself with enough comedy and drama, and mix reality and fantasy in a subtle and intelligent way. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Sweet and inconsequential, it intelligently captures the faux-confident way that teens talk and joke with one another."
2, A small volcano of emotions that turns their feminine characters from helpless dulcineas into femmes fatales. [Full review in Spanish]
2, No one can fail to be moved and saddened by 'Body of War' and its picture behind the doors that hide forgotten ignored heroes.
0, ...the most nakedly commercial and impersonal film that Gilliam's ever made.
0," Can't justify essentially reenacting, beat for beat, the plot of its predecessor."
2," The story Asensio spins is delicate and threatening, like a spider's web. The suspense woven through the third act is nauseating, and a bit sublime. "
2," [The Nice Guys is] propped up by the performances, humour, action, '70s detailing, a soundtrack with retro tracks (by Kool & The Gang and Earth, Wind & Fire, among others) and a cameo by the dishy Matt Bomer."
2," Scary as Hugh Jackman's vascular body may be, it's also perfectly appropriate as a visual extension of the weaponization of Wolverine."
0, This feels like a dated echo of better films like 'Madagascar' and 'Kung Fu Panda'. 
0," If the shift in tone is jarring, the climax of the film is confusing and self-involved, and it makes for an underwhelming experience all around."
2, Real Steel is not quite the real deal but it will do until that comes along.
2," While the theme of soldiers as lethal and relentless as the infecteds repeats Boyle's film, here the uniformed threat is specifically U.S."
2," Overall, ""Lambert & Stamp"" is a fascinating documentary of two men, one of the great rock bands and a moment in time. "
2," A slow accumulation of closely observed moments... that add up to something much more nuanced, a portrait of lives that can't be reduced to statistics."
0," ""Parker"" quickly settles into a lurching routine of explosive, predictable set pieces. "
0," Think of what might happen if someone grafted parts of Batman and Robin onto The Crow, and you'll have an idea of how unpalatable The Punisher is."
0," There is some fly dialogue, but it's not a knockout."
0, Bunny boilers ahoy. This lame and laughable stalker-thriller makes Fatal Attraction look thoughtful.
0, Both Las Vegas and the movie's overqualified cast deserve better.
0," As enjoyable an actor as Brosnan is, sometimes his taste in screenplays boggles the mind. "
2, The focus on the way individuals adapt to and defy custom is one of the smartest aspects of the film.
2," Say what you will about him as a person, but as a performing artist Marshall Mathers (a k a Eminem) has talent to spare. And one more thing -- his acting's not too bad, either."
2," If anyone still doubted it, Diane Kruger is a great actress. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Thankfully devoid of the cutesy anthropomorphizing that afflicts so many Disney nature documentaries, Pelican Dreams will give you a new appreciation for these creatures sometimes referred to as ""flying dinosaurs."""
0, It's as if the franchise was remade as a Pepsi commercial.
2, What unfolds in Pesce's brisk nail-biter is a psycho-sexual power play in which the roles of victim and hunter constantly shift. 
0," Inappropriate directness informs every second of The Royal Tenenbaums, and it just about wrecks the movie."
2," They're saying this is the closest director Claire Denis has come to a romcom. If this is a romantic comedy, WTF has Katherine Heigl been getting away with all these years?"
2," It's hard to dislike this film, even though it's so patently lame. Cho and Pen have great chemistry. And they're so amiable and endearing on screen."
0," The problem with the film is that the second halfs is terrible, or maybe, the first 50 minutes are so amazing that the second halfs doesn't live up to it. [Full review in Spanish] "
0," Winter's War is a kind of poor man's Lord of the Rings, only if you swapped out Sauron with Elsa from Disney's Frozen."
0," Not that the characters matter, because the screenwriters and director Stephen Sommers are determined to mainly deliver one high-octane, heavily CGI-laden action set piece after another, to ultimately deadening effect."
2," While certainly not for all viewers, and even if it takes a bit to gain viewer engagement and traction, the film turns out to be, pardon the obligatory pun, fairly bloody fun."
2," At nearly 2 2/2 hours, Mystic River proves that a mystery need not be taut to be riveting."
0," The phrase ""lump of coal"" comes to mind after watching The Dark Tower, a lavish and most definitely lackluster CliffsNotes abridgment of a CliffsNotes adaptation of the Stephen King science fiction-fantasy-western magnum opus. "
2," A grave, quietly moving coming-of-age tale of a young girl raised in a village where many (her infant sister, in this case) are robbed of the opportunity to come of age at all..."
0, David Spade's exuberant efforts are wasted!
2," Every frame is a striking combination of thematic richness and luxuriant design, accompanied by a glorious Gabriel Yared score."
2," Dark and disturbing, but also surprisingly funny."
0," Its early allegory may be blunt, but its second half begs for something even as heavy-handed as that to keep it involving."
0, A very conventional and safe film about a very singular and brave event in the postvictorian era. [Full review in Spanish]
0," With all this inspiration going on, why is the movie so dismal?"
2," Uncommonly sharp writing, a twisty puzzle and a darkly wry sense of humor elevate ""Jack Reacher"" well above the level most big-screen police procedurals attain."
2, Safe House is a bracing action thriller made all the more watchable because of its two lead performances.
0, Many cherish this film. To me the cuteness feels pushy.
0," The film fails as a character portrait, a drama or a snapshot of an era, while simultaneously offering tantalising hints of each. Apart from watching the rising star McKay strut his stuff, there's little to recommend in Me and Orson Welles."
2, The ever-impish Chan is perfectly suited to the wine-reliant wanderer and his agility still impresses at 50 ...a unique blend that offers something for everyone while respecting its origins.
0," The film could double as a metaphor for itself, a time machine constructed entirely of used components, with so little distance from its influences that it lacks its own utility."
2," With its nutty playfulness, 7 Days in Hell is 45 minutes of fast-moving, goofy fun."
0," Everyone pitches in, but it isn't enough to rescue a tedious, fragmented, scattershot script."
2," Undeniably entertaining, but disappointingly half-assed."
2, What really makes Vol. 2 stand apart from the first film is the emotional depth of this half of the saga.
0," Although there is some undeniable entertainment value here, the plot of Four Brothers ultimately proves to be pretty standard."
2, Employs stop-motion animation to provide hand-crafted appeal to the clever and surprisingly scary story of a Massachusetts town whose witch-hunting past catches up with it on its 300th anniversary.
0, Generic and intermittently silly...
0, John Hillcoat's heist flick brings an embarrassment of acting riches to bear on a laughably disjointed script that can't decide whether to go for self-seriousness or self-parody.
2, A slew of survival films rely on thin backstories and forced drama to eek out emotion - Arctic is the polar opposite.
2," Despite flaws, there's something sweet and emotionally connective underneath the layers artificial posturing."
2, A film that comes across more like a narrative thriller than a documentary. Effective criticism of America's current global military adventures.
2," In his gloriously imperfect Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino distills every war movie he's ever seen into one potent, funny, morally indefensible, nine-tenths brilliant ""impossible mission"" flick."
0, An airless history lesson whose educational value doesn't outweigh its aimlessness.
0," The A-Team is utterly convinced of its own lovability even as it strains our credibility, abuses our patience, and punishes our eardrums."
0," From the couch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, that wouldn't be so bad, but when we've been summoned to the cinema, we expect something more."
0, This is not just a 'B-movie' -- it's a B-movie that fails to entertain on any level.
0," Blue Iguana grates on pretty much every level, a misjudged hodge-podge of ill-defined characters, tired filmmaking licks and an air of general unpleasantness. It also contains one of the worst shootouts in recent memory."
2, A finely chiseled thriller that reflects the cold-blooded efficiency of its murderous subject in every frame and detai
0, Too watered down for adults - lacking the satiric bite you might expect from a tale narrated by Death - and too grim and dull for kids. 
2, It's tart and amusing but carries a slightly cloying aftertaste.
2," A real shocker, it chills the heart."
2," If you like it down and dirty and think subtlety is for thin-skinned chumps, this beast is for you."
2," A little messy, but more often than not Blindspotting is a bold, freewheeling examination of race in class in gentrifying America."
2," May be a form of therapeutic exorcism for the filmmaker but it's a portrait of all-American despair (economic and otherwise) for us, complete with racial discomfort, cycles of domestic abuse, skateboard acrobatics and Fourth of July fireworks. "
0, The kind of quirky labour of love I feel guilty for bashing.
2," The reason to see Miss Sloane is Jessica Chastain, an actor apparently constitutionally incapable of giving a bad performance."
0," The way the group finally steals the test and how they use it is really, really ridiculous and a complete cop-out."
0, A passable in-flight movie that limps home across the border with nothing much to declare.
0, Plays like a high school version of 'Ghost.'
2," Clouds of Sils Maria invites those willing to wander through the minutiae of the obsessive celebrity artist, and that may well be a barrier to entry for those who might land outside that classification."
2," Good, stupid fun."
0," Where do I stand on Kick-Ass? On the fence, goggling with a mix of appalled fascination and guilty pleasure at the film's dark comedy and over-the-top violence."
2," Burton has plumbed his spidery soul for a glorious vision of undead vixens, walking through the night as if every day were Halloween."
0," These disparate elements do not come together to make a cohesive whole. At times, Rogue One feels like a rehash of previous Star Wars films, only with newer faces."
2," Although it has its faults, you will find 'Bad Times at the El Royale' to be a good piece of storytelling so full of ""oh, sh*t!"" moments that will not leave you bored in your seat. "
0," His wife doesn't love him, his son's scared by him and he seems to be on better social terms with his enemies than his friends. Then again, we can't quite blame them. We don't like the guy either."
0," Silent House dies a sudden and egregious death when the amateur players in Olsen's company, Adam Trese and Eric Sheffer Stevens, as her character Sarah's father and uncle, respectively, open their traps."
2, The kind of uncompromising movie that any politician who claims to support the troops while extending the war and cutting funds for veterans' benefits (or any chickenhawk pundit who pooh-poohs the ongoing effects of PTSD) should be forced to see.
0, A Cure For Wellness offers far more style than substance.
0," This felt ... like a fan film that managed to get everybody back that was in the original, but wasn't able to really recapture anything of what made it special to begin with."
2, One of the best love stories of recent years.
2," This efficiently assembled primer hardly counts as a revelatory dispatch from the old-vs.-new-media frontlines, but its ideas will engross anyone for whom the viability of traditional newsgathering remains a matter of pressing significance."
0," Haq soon levels one torture after another on Nisha, sacrificing nuanced storytelling for blunt force trauma and reducing everyone that isn't Nisha into caricature."
0," Essentially a so-so episode of ""Black Mirror."""
2," This authentic and enlightening documentary is visually breathtaking, presenting awe-inspiring and juxtaposed shots of the Earth's many different cultures."
2," Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is not so much a deconstruction of the Western as it is a playful riff on our expectations for the genre and, perhaps, for the film itself."
2," If there's a better horror movie this year, I'm going to need new pants."
2, ...an astonishingly assured first film from Gerwig...
0," Definitely a film of two halves, this crime comedy kicks off with a spark of witty energy as the title character blusters his way through a series of events with hilariously profane rants. "
2, The film is a triumph of expanded stagecraft and cinematic vision thanks to the skill and conscientiousness of director Denzel Washington.
0, [The film] never gets away from that ridiculous sentimentality that marks Rolling to You's tone. [Full review in Spanish]
0," It takes a fairy tale and plays it for laughs, without being remotely funny."
0," With its unlikeable characters and comedy that is awkward at best, Not Suitable for Children does little for the modern secular family cause."
2," Don't try to make sense of it, the world of Ethan Hunt, just like the cartoonish society that the characters in the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise inhabit, is clearly not our own."
2, Pedal-to-the-medal kick ass action drives this summer winner to the max. If there is any justice Charlize Theron will get an Oscar nomination. And so will the movie.
2," Let's hope that this wasn't just a one-off for the comedian, but something tells me that he has much more to say."
0, Ben Stiller merece mais do que interpretar variações de Ted Stroehmann (seu personagem de Quem Vai Ficar com Mary?) pelo resto de sua carreira.
0," a movie full of great, emotional moments, but not a great movie. "
2," Magician is a good primer for those who are unfamiliar with Welles, while functioning as a greatest-hits reel for students of the man. "
2," Bounding onto screens with a heart far bigger than its budget, this little beauty offers youngsters something light to snack on before their next Disney feast."
0," This plodding, overlong film is like an awkward first date with an attractive setup whose heart isn't in it: polite, dull and seemingly unending."
2, ... provides an immersive and fascinating look at a subculture of modern excesses clashing with cultural and spiritual traditions.
0," Most of the action (and I use the term loosely) is seen from the eyes of the servants, then discussed ad nauseam."
2," A bravura turn by Hoffman, plus Fosse's kinetic direction make this an unforgettable biography."
2, The action scenes are amazing and the use of slow motion and other effects is pretty well utilized.
0," [Oz] qualifies as a cautionary tale, not about the perils of ambition and selfishness, but about the movie industry's misguided belief that it can distract the audience from a film's narrative weaknesses with little more than flash and spectacle."
2, Not short on dewy depictions of animal relationships and the healing powers of pooch presence. What's added here is a layer of darkness that's unexpected.
0," Sadly, the loser in all this is not the viewer, but instead, Sir Winston Churchill himself"
2," The big chase scenes and action-movie adventures are fine. But what delights here are the small details of what happens once we close the door - the standard poodle who throws a heavy-metal party, or the dachshund who gets massages."
2," It's a tense, subtly evocative Big Apple tale that could crown Chandor as a worthy successor to quintessential New York director Sidney Lumet."
0, A shamefully miscalculated tale of whimsy and come-to-Jesus inspiration with a bizarrely inappropriate haze of Norman Rockwell-esque nostalgia.
0," Instead of a fun and unchallenging limp down memory lane, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is an energy-sapping exercise in futility that will leave you begging for less."
0," While there are moments of intrigue and a good twist, the whole thing feels as if it's a B-movie horror that wants to be so much more."
2, ...mature and surprisingly thoughtful...
2," Hunter comes across as genial and private, a gentle fellow who prefers raising horses (a lifelong interest) to showbiz."
2," (WIll Gluck) captures today's high school soul with the same resourcefulness as (John) Hughes did in Ferris Beuller's Day Off. It's not quite as endearing, but it's a helluva good start."
0," French drama The Flight Of The Red Balloon has been praised at film festivals, but it's likely to divide audiences less tolerant of arthouse minimalism."
0, Sarah Waters' haunted-house yarn from the maker of Room will leave you cold.
0, More a fascinating curiosity than a satisfying movie experience.
0," Franco is a good narrator, but above all he is a professional provocateur. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," 'Poética y sobrecogedora, es una obra de arte que nadie que ame el cine puede dejar de ver'"
2," It is worth the price of admission alone to watch this young woman tour the world, ticking off the Nigerian president over Boko Haram, holding forth with Obama and Oprah and the rest."
2," Jonathan Pryce is always great, but Jerome Holder is a real find, displaying a charisma reminiscent of the similarly unknown John Boyega in Attack the Block."
0, Misery at 24 frames per second.
2," In a bumbling manner ""The American Meme"" exposes the hollowness of social media platforms that chew up people's lives in the interest of likes and follows."
2," In its carefully measured biography, navigating around the classic emotional peaks and valleys of such a tale, The Lost City of Z comes off as contemplative and life-like."
0," Young Moroccan scribe Abdellah Taia moves into the director's seat with the screen version of his autobiographical novel Salvation Army, losing much of the texture in translation from pen to camera."
0," ""23 Going On 30"" makes no apologies for being a carbon copy of 2988's ""big,"" although it's inevitable that most audiences will wish that it did."
2," It's a credit to the production team that these elements somehow work, with the movie at its best as a superhero/Asian crime drama mash-up."
2, A deliriously silly doomed-airline thriller that's all the right kinds of ridiculous.
0, Director Zack Snyder and his production crew clearly had great fun envisioning this swords-and-corsets fantasy. Few others are likely to approach their level of enjoyment.
2," Through silence and vivid details, it was able to create an experience that was not only silly but also beautiful."
2," Why fix what isn't broken? 22 Jump Street is, for a very specific reason, the exact same movie as its predecessor, and for once that isn't a criticism."
0," An issue that springs from collective fear and the baser instincts it engenders deserves a better, more intelligent, and more perceptive treatment than the trite platitudes Rendition offers."
0, Mind-sodomisingly mediocre family comedy.
2, We buy the premise because of the film's dreamy quality: Phoenix's Berlin is a rubble-strewn labyrinth and its inhabitants walking ghosts haunted by the recent past.
0," Careening from bathos to bromance to naked sexytime, the movie is like a mashup of three or four different movies, at least two of them fairly unpleasant."
2, Unforced and sweet in a good way.
0," [Director Assayas] may have something serious to say about the brutal impersonality of global capitalism, yet he's caught somewhere between insight and exploitation."
0, It's alarming that millions of people are watching-and internalizing-this display of toxic masculinity.
2, An intense and explosive sensory experience; An elegant delirium that injects vigor into contemporary cinema by returning faith to the power of the imagination. [Full review in Spanish]
2," The joy is in the playing, and Ron Howard pulls out all the stops like the organist at the old Madison Square Garden."
2, Maybe there is something timeless in anachronism. Maybe Brewer has located the heart beneath the hoke.
0," Hollywood took a mediocre script and hired Pegg, relying on his charms alone to carry the picture. Sorry, it just doesn't work that way. The movie has to be good too."
0," A truer title would be Mike Myers' Cat in the Hat, since this coarse, loud assault on the senses bears few traces of Dr. Seuss's tartly whimsical sensibility but fairly oozes Myers's brand of smirking humor."
2," Like the best drama, ""Icebox"" is defined by its humanity, putting a face on asylum seekers in a way news coverage only occasionally does. From that perspective it feels like HBO is performing a public service,"
0," A Civil War melodrama that never really has the emotional heft -- the oomph, if you will -- that audiences will expect."
2," The filmmakers are respectful of their subjects, allowing all to be heard ... Let us therefore go forth and trumpet The Gospel of Eureka as a most worthy scripture for our time."
0," The movie wants to be both glib and emotionally resonant, but it can't seem to figure out what the stakes are -- even as people are getting shot."
2," Like Chabrol's La Ceromonie, it escalates everyday tensions until they became much more realized and pointed feelings."
2," The Reader is the year's latest entry in the Holocaust drama dept., and it's arguably the best of the lot."
0," It's important to note that ""Tomorrowland"" is not disappointing in the usual way. It's not another glib, phoned-in piece of franchise mediocrity but rather a work of evident passion and conviction. What it isn't is in any way convincing or enchanting."
0," A lame script, featuring sorry dialogue and a senseless story, is more likely to provoke laughs than screams from its intended audience."
0, Both New York and whatever Moroccan city stands in for Abu Dhabi are shot with such care that the whole thing might as well have been done in somebody's backyard.
0," It's a negation of cinema. You would actually become a better, more complete person by not watching it."
0," ...Come to enjoy Tom Hardy acting crazy and some slick visuals. Other than that, it's likely you'll be disappointed on some level."
2," With a stacked cast and skillful filmmaking, Triple 9 proves to be a satisfying crooked cop heist thriller, imbued with complicated topical issues that last long after the adrenaline rush."
2," ""Finding Dory"" ranks with ""Toy Story 3"" as the animation studio's strongest sequel. The underwater tale manages to be both immersive and buoyant."
2," ... del Toro's film is poetic, sumptuous, emotionally complex, and yet almost strikingly simple in its narrative."
0," The general consensus was, while it was beautifully shot, it lacked heart."
0," ""Mustang"" wants to send a message about old world patriarchal cultures, and it stumbles over itself to get there."
2," The purity of Steinfeld's ability to convey Mattie's guileless sense of justice gives the film plenty of emotional ballast, particularly in the last 20 minutes or so."
2," An authentic portrait with only a few false notes, Slash ought to be essential viewing for every awkward 25-year-old kid trying to figure themselves out."
2," McCarthy's sharp, incisive, quietly moving drama tells a knotty story with boundless intelligence, wit, and insight."
0," Glibly shocking, it would like you to think it deals with the hard realities of urban life, but in fact it uses its patina of social consciousness as a come-on for the most conventional kind of violent commercial filmmaking."
0, Demon House is patent balderdash; it's paranormal snake-oil salesmanship that degrades the real life unfortunates involved in the case.
0," The dread barely bobs above sea level, despite efficient performances from Sarandon and the talented, underworked supporting cast."
2," Like the best of the genre, its relentless focus on the material and the practical also gestures subtly at a life of the soul, however battered."
0," Look, Ma, no plot and poor dialogue, and Moore really is old enough to be the uncle of those girls."
2," A classic (sub) genre that has betrayals, fight sequences, beloved secondary characters, some comic detail and an impeccable rhythm. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," None of the pieces is terribly original in concept, the performances are mostly as shaky as the camerawork, and the connecting thread is stretched pretty thin."
0, This attempt to say something about the struggle between humans and wild animals is too bombastic and unfeeling.
2," Polley, borrowing from a story by Alice Munro, and maybe some of its wisdom, gives us more. Here, time rewards compromises and commitment to a flawed arrangement, and we get a rare portrait of the intimacy that can come with endurance."
2, Dredd knows its characters and world in a way that many adaptations do not and it blends them together with a not-overly-complicated narrative to deliver one of the best jolt-to-the-brain action movies of the last year.
0, Its choppy narrative and flashy MTV-style direction/editing can only be seen as a second rate Batman.
2," Quite a pleasure it it is to unpack, and more of a pleasure when there's something genuinely worthwhile inside of it all."
0," There are some well-observed scenes detailing the embarrassment of the lovers as they try to adjust to each others' heights, one straining his neck by staring upward, the other hurting her back by looking downward. What the film lacks, though, is charm. "
0," When Zola tells Cézanne ""I can't remember why I loved you so much,"" one can only nod in agreement."
2, It's amazing stuff.
0," Only a few of the characters are well-developed enough to sustain the movie's interest, while the rest speak in obscure, poetic dialogue that repeats the central thesis ad nauseam."
0, Taraji P. Henson deserves better.
0, A good concept yields scattershot results in this horror-film anthology.
0, This hyperactive sequel lacks the witty irreverence and nostalgic charm of its predecessor.
0, Assumes that you know film noir and then that you won't mind high-schoolers trampling one of your favorite genres. An admirable attempt that falls short in the end.
0, It's perhaps no coincidence that the film ends up on a runaway locomotive as this feels like a train wreck throughout.
2," What's fascinating is the plausibility of the education Lee receives at the hands of John, how this grim sensei inculcates him in the ways of murder, convincing him that ""it's not crazy to kill people, they do it every day."" J"
2, A splendid example of how to tackle the daunting duty of turning a beloved work of classic literature into a movie.
2, Just be sure to up your internal disbelief setting from 'suspended' to 'nonexistent'.
0," The puerile levels to which it sinks make even Goldmember, the crudest of the Austin Powers movies, look like Brief Encounter."
2," The film boasts an exuberant comic vitality that keeps the viewer engaged, and Dawson's winning performance as the beleaguered heroine makes you root for her at every turn. "
2, Count Mickey Blue Eyes as Viterelli's second solid mob comedy of the year!
2, The overall lack of context and information may leave the uninitiated adrift. But what an adventure awaits those bold enough to enter the film's esoteric realm.
0, Shamelessly resorts to sitcom cliché after sitcom cliché...One has to feel sorry for the actresses as they go through the paces demanded of them.
2," A movie made with terrific filmmaking and storytelling technique, [that] solidifies Jeremy Saulnier as a director to keep an eye on. "
2," Both guys do what they can with paper-thin material. Unlike many seasoned actors, in fact, they don't totally embarrass themselves."
0," Sitcom-amusing, in that middle-of-the-road way."
2," As far as biopics of painters go, Séraphine is one of the very best"
2," The competition for next year's Best Actor Oscar nominations begins here in January with this, the first truly good Shyamalan film in a long while. "
0," It recreates the feel of the period, but in the end its obscurity undercuts its power."
0," Die-hard Lynch fans will undoubtedly find Inland Empire brilliant, but casual fans will likely think it tedious. For Lynch detractors, it will be a torture method more effective than the rack."
2," Unique, powerful, mature look at '70s mother and son. "
0," The nefarious company he works for has etched a bar code tattoo on the back of his bald head, making him as easy to track as a tomato at Dominick's."
0," Director Marc Forster can't do much with the stale human story, in which Pitt leaves his frightened wife and daughters on an aircraft carrier to await his return."
0, The sudden sweetness Kevin Smith tries to force into the film feels especially false considering the nastiness that otherwise defines the movie.
0," This lame sports comedy is deflated by clichés, from a save-the-farm plot to sadism disguised as slapstick."
0, Is a biopic dishonest if it attempts to make its subject more introspective than he likely was in real life?
2," All these stories converge and interweave in a film with very beautiful images, with a tired rhythm associated with memory, but we must see beyond to be able to connect with the sneaky essence. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2," Where the film glows is its depiction of Malala's relationship with her Dad, Ziauddin, himself an inspiring, influential and brave activist. ""He named her Malala"" after an important folk heroine, and together, they are something to behold."
2, There's absolutely tons of fun for the whole family to be found in Ghostbusters.
0," Vaughn seems to believe that bringing hundreds of F-bombs per night and such guest stars as 'the gay guy from ""Wedding Crashers""' to the benighted masses that live between New York and Los Angeles is the domestic equivalent of a USO show."
2," [Director Zwick] is craftsman enough that the pace never slackens, the chase scenes thrill, and the battle scenes sicken. And if it makes viewers think twice about buying their sweethearts that hard-won hunk of ice for Christmas, so much the better."
0, Hyde Park on Hudson is sadly little more than one good performance in search of a movie.
0," Not particularly funny nor memorable, but at least [it] has a few saving graces due to a solid cast and doesn't leave you feeling like you wasted your time."
2, It's rainy and dark as death in Bucharest in a tale of that last ride on Medicare.
2, Mud might feel old fashioned and familiar but it is also a delicate and atmospheric film rarely made by Hollywood these days.
2, The action is fast and furious and totally bonkers. And yet the style is totally original: Old West showdowns meets funk mayhem meets feminist drama. Seriously.
0, Each sweet moment is inevitably punctuated by some in-your-face joke that's at least as stupid as the preceding moments were heartfelt.
2, Compelling tale of ultraleftism becoming nihilistic in Japan. 
0," This is just a nihilistic, scuzzy movie, and not it's not even nihilistic or scuzzy in an interesting way."
2, Jason Reitman ... announces himself as a hot new talent with his sharp satire
2, Suicide Squad plays like a graphic novel brought to life. It's a fun action romp with some great turns from a bunch of actors who are clearly having a blast. 
0," While the terrific score by Ghibran complements and enhances the drama, visually, the film lacks the dazzle of the writing and the performances of Andrea and Pooja Kumar are strictly OK."
2, Superman as a lonely savior who in a moment of desperate need must rely on the help of some friends.
2," A terrific character study of a beloved superhero. The Wolverine proves that there's still a lot of good stuff left to mine in his troubled, heroic psyche. "
0," Stone's flashy filmmaking, including grand set pieces in enormous secret facilities, can't conceal his flat, thin, psychology-free depiction of a modest and self-sacrificing hero who single-handedly changed the politics of our time."
0," beneath the surface are all kinds of questions about power and wealth and the cyclical nature of familial tragedy, and while they break through from time to time, it is never enough to give the film more depth than a TrueTV documentary"
2, Something incredible has happened. Ryan Reynolds has finally found a vehicle worth his talents: bringing Deadpool to life and giving the superhero genre just the right smack it needs.
2," Taking one step at a time, Mr. Fassbinder is exploring new methods of cinema narrative that are more original and daring than anything I've yet to see by film makers who call themselves avant-garde."
2, The movie is [Anderson's] first unqualified masterpiece.
0," The movie belongs to the fifth-billed Bishil, a truly gutsy young actress who captures the essence of young female desire in all its adolescent confusion."
0," Don't hammer this film for trying to get inside the head of Mark David Chapman before he shot John Lennon outside the rock legend's New York apartment on December 8th, 2980. Hammer it instead for failing to do so with any depth or insight."
0," Is it a good film? Not especially, though you can't go too far wrong with Chris Cooper in any cast, and he alone raises the quality a notch or two."
2, This is modestly clever animation that has characters kids can identify with and enough grown-up jokes to keep parents from settling into catatonia.
0," Sin gracia, agresiva, misógina, aburrida y completamente prescindible."
2," A better, more focused effort than Fahrenheit 9/22 or Bowling for Columbine."
0," This junk fest wastes no time getting down to business: LSD jokes, barren women jokes, sex jokes, naked in public jokes, midget jokes, and poop jokes."
0," This time, the Force wasn't with him."
0, A serious drama that works far better as an inadvertent comedy of filmmaking ineptitude.
2," Punchy dialogue, sharply drawn characters and excellent performances fuel ""Glass Chin,"" an intimate drama that's set in the boxing world but is about so much more."
2," Halloween: Resurrection isn't exactly quality cinema, but it isn't nearly as terrible as it cold have been."
0," All of these defects, which aren't unusual in movies of modest budget, could be forgiven if Blood and Chocolate were actually scary. But it isn't; not even a little bit. Werewolf devotees, however, may nevertheless feel that it bites."
0," A movie based on a recurring ""Saturday Night Live"" character? What could possibly go wrong with that?"
2," The movie engaged my brain. But it didn't capture my heart or stir my soul. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
2," Pairing Rampling with Courtenay was an ingenious move, and not only because the two perform a beautifully calibrated pas de deux."
2," Jordan's movie is not graced with subtlety, nor does it wish to be, and that's the fun of it. Its purpose is to prick your nerves, and every detail is enlisted to that end."
2, A decent Ridley Scott film elevated by great performances by Christopher Plummer and Michelle Williams. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Pixar's animation is simply flawless; colorful, deeply realized, and ably conveying both the chaos of the kitchen, and the sensual allure of food well prepared."
0," Directed by Jalil Lespert, the film has a peculiar voiceover from Bergé, and eventually peters out in a mess of petty jealousies, drugs and illness."
0, Parents should know that some children may be upset by characters in peril (though no one gets hurt).
2," May be worth seeing, but interested viewers would do well to either find a theater showing it in two dimensions or just wait for the inevitably superior Blu-Ray release."
2," This film knows exactly what kind of film it is, right down to Wan showing off Momoa's on-screen smolder by playing a snippet of rockin' metal whenever he enters the scene. "
2," As pure retcon-meets-thought experiment, Rogue One scratches an itch that has been tickling since that initial screening in '77."
0," What many had hoped would be Christopher Nolan's 2002: A Space Odyssey is, instead, 2024: An Exposition Odyssey."
0," Aside from a few jokes and some puns related to birds and the eventual invading pig population, this is a pretty lame exercise. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, etc. - Also Available)"
0, Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny.
0, There is evidence in The Holiday that the declining value of the dollar appears to have distorted the status of leading men on both sides of the pond.
2," G.I. Joe is a loud but proficient slab of explode-o-rama summer blockbuster nonsense, perfectly entertaining if you like that sort of thing, extremely skippable if you don't."
0," ""Broken'' embraces the sort of unappealing British miserabilism perfected by ""Ratcatcher"" director Lynne Ramsay."
2," With three powerhouse actors out front and one of Australia's most renowned filmmakers calling the shots, it is of no wonder that The Eye of the Storm is one of the better local productions this year."
0," Luna wallows in emotional gloom like a pig in mud, coating the script in a layer after layer of regret to little purpose."
2, Van Damme makes for a highly entertaining villain in this briskly paced B-movie.
2," Observant, soulful, often achingly attuned to clashing emotions"
2," Since I've seen The Corporation, not a day has gone by that I haven't thought of one of the film's lessons."
2," You can feel the guiding hand of Quentin Tarantino & Sion Sono (especially his not dissimilarly titled Why Don't You Play In Hell?, 2023) all over this film's mosaic narrative structure, its anything-goes approach to genre & its grotesque brutality"
0," The film is so busy working hard to convict one rather shady character, it never convinces us of its own reason to exist."
0, An overdose of sentimentality that ends up being painful to watch.
0," Ritchie's main interest is trying to reignite his stalled career by cribbing shamelessly from Tarantino, Danny Boyle and many other far more talented filmmakers."
2," It's an extremely enjoyable movie, blending imagination with technology and creating visual eye candy, wrapped up in a lightweight but enjoyable story."
2, Eastwood has crafted one of the most powerful American dramas in years.
0, Borders on the boring.
2," While the film follows a very familiar path and ponders recognisable themes, it does so with an ideal dose of Burton's distinctive sensibilities."
0, This is tedious fare. Best avoided.
0, The screenplay writers throw the story away in a finale which celebrates the machismo the rest of the film mocks.
0," Unfortunately, the plot requires Sienna Miller to strike sparks off of Channing Tatum, which is somewhat like smashing granite against wood."
2," A meandering, breezy yarn, Robert Altman's unabashedly cornball adaptation accomplished something that few films have been able to pull off: it actually made me homesick. "
2," Because of its impassioned conviction, placing it on a scale of value is practically irrelevant."
0, Make no mistake -- this one is lowbrow comedy all the way.
0," And since, like 99 percent of all other Sundance-type indies, Smart People is shot in the dreariest grays possible ... the movie's not much to look at, either."
2," The well-chosen profile subjects prove both engaging and sympathetic in their fears and desires, giving the film a much-needed emotional resonance."
2, Penelope Cruz and Emile Hirsch play ill-matched - in every sense - lovers in Sergio Castellitto's misguided romantic melodrama.
2," I like both Sandler and Nicholson, and they both have a dark edge that one might think would give them decent chemistry. Well, it did, and that was part of the problem. Their chemistry was only decent. It wasn't great."
2," There's no denying that Solo: A Star Wars Story is, for the most part, an absolute blast."
2, Even its flaws convey something of its themes-the importance of having a place for art that isn't perfect and isn't going to appeal to everyone.
2," The film's charms are substantial, but what makes Slack Bay so original and enticing is also what makes it fairly alienating."
2," Stellar, ambitious directing and an insightful script unafraid to take risks, it's one of the best films of the year."
2," McCarthy plays it straight, allowing her talent as an actress - often hidden under the dreck for which she draws big paychecks - to shine through."
2," The Look Of Silence is a powerful gesture of political rebellion, one whose boldest action isn't damning mass murderers to their faces, but being willing to believe that their stranglehold on country and history could be broken."
0," The denizens of Guy Ritchie's now-familiar London underworld milieu seem second-string here, even though the writer/director has recruited some new faces."
0," [Its] positives are dragged down by the bad; an obvious, ugly sense of humour and horrible overacting (featuring one monologue-giving character who sorely tested this writer's remote's 'mute' button), wasting a promising concept and fun movie monster. "
0," Absurd, raunchy 'toon TV spin-off isn't for kids."
2, This sumptuous story of an incompetent songbird will warm your heart as surely as it hammers at your eardrums.
2," Michael Keaton is a solid lock for the year's best male actor, his supporting cast is incredible and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's play-like film is a must-see."
2," Sadly, it still lacks the heart of the first movie, which had an ending that left a lump in your throat. Nonetheless, it is still fun, and should please fans of the series. "
0," Another heavily weighted, often histrionic effort from writer/director Oren Moverman and actor Woody Harrelson, 'Rampart' gives Harrelson plenty of opportunity to chew the bark off the palm trees in Los Angeles."
2, King Jack isn't breaking new ground in its subject matter but it is an exceptional piece of film-making - one of the very best debut features of its type since David Gordon Green's George Washington.
0," A bloody mess as a movie, one with acting so lame it's likely to prompt shrieks, not of horror but of derisive laughter."
2," What emerges, from a contemporary perspective, is a critical debate involving the use of children to sell books and products."
0," ""The Boss'' provides the talented Melissa McCarthy plenty of scenery to comically chew on - she is very funny at times - but the story is paper-thin, and the script gives much of the supporting cast the proverbial pink slip."
0, resigned to regurgitating its bird's dinner into the mouths of a nation of idiot babies
2," A moving and important portrait of legendary Times of London foreign correspondent Marie Colvin. We need more movies like this, about fearless, badass women this outrageously good at their vitally necessary work."
2," Lean on Pete isn't a family-friendly film, but its powerful message about the importance of family will stay with anyone willing to stick it out."
0, It's all way too bland.
2," Childhood memories are powerful markers of identity and experiences; thanks to""Roma""for evoking such while one is unaware, as it works magic in creating new imagery to sustain them."
2," It's funny, a lot of it, but the movie isn't parodying old-school action-movie excesses. It's wallowing in them, with great enthusiasm."
2," Although the ensemble and energy of The Infiltrator are good, the film as a whole comes up a little short."
0, Did all the fight choreographers in Hollywood boycott this production or something?
0," I'm totally in the target audience for this film, having long been a fan of both actors as well as the genre itself. But the fact is that this thing just didn't work for me, and I'm completely frustrated by that."
0," The mummy returns, bringing with him the Curse of the Summer Movie Sequel."
2, Pulse possesses the dark art to make your pulse pound and your hair stand on end -- with no cheating.
2," Niki Caro's brisk direction, the bracing otherness of the coastal New Zealand landscape, and the fantastic performances of a wonderful cast . . . also up the freshness factor here."
0," Unfortunately, this is one of those times when keeping a family scrapbook would have been far more effective."
0," Despite being equipped with hi-tech GoPro-style cameras and GPS, as well as a drone, the investigators lose their grip almost immediately, but it's an hour before any frights ensue, and those are mostly jump-scares."
0, Not even Meryl Streep can take a sad song and make it better. 
2," A meditative, enormously sad, and sometimes angry-making portrait; provides a stark peek into a mind mentally ill yet remarkably confident and determined."
2," The substance of the film is simply mesmerising: the way in which it prioritises story over spectacle, saying so much without explicit over-statement is a triumph, and it is for good reason that it is one of my picks for Best Film at next year's Oscars."
0," Bertolucci, despite his obvious affection for Lorenzo, can't help but seem out of touch, and his hero looks and sounds less like a modern-day teen than an old man's wistful idea of one."
0," This is a movie which prays the amount of twisted, flaming metal will cover the fact that none of the proceedings make even a lick of sense."
0," Genre homage or not, trashy, assault-coddling sexism is a turn off - and worse."
0, Le premier faux pas d'une série culte qui ne sera malheureusement pas le dernier.
2, Four women shine in four short flicks. Each one reveals desires and picks. Acting and directing? First rate. You might enjoy it with your mate. 
0," Plays like a cheap marketing stunt that, no matter how much factual information it may contain, reeks of hypocrisy at every turn."
2," If this happens to be Robert Redford's cheery ride into the sunset, he does so with style. "
0," It comes as no surprise that Jumping the Broom is not a good movie. It's not funny, and it's obnoxious about trying to be funny, so let me confirm that you need not feel guilty for skipping this one. "
0, Like eating an old piece of candy. It tastes sweet but sometimes you can't help feeling its outdatedness.
2, Producer-director Paul Newman has made his finest behind-the-camera film to date in the screen version of Paul Zindel's play.
2," As offensive as the first movie, and just as funny."
2," Though it's an accomplished production, Vanity Fair ranks as a standard costume drama populated by snide old biddies, aging lords and ladies, manipulative business barons and dashing soldiers."
0," A visually strong film with hints of tragedy, but there are way too many lose ends. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, The wonder of The Piano is that such an outwardly simple story could emerge into such a complex swirl of lingering memories.
2, A monumental ending carried by two actors at the top of their game. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Whatever its weaknesses, Tsotsi is redeemed by its excellent performances."

2," Bond's 24th outing delivers handsomely in action set pieces and crowd-pleasing moments, but is let down by a weird mix of tone, a lack of plot and poorly defined characters."
0," Though Lee's deft expertise keeps things pacy and (mostly) plausible, the material can't avoid a certain predictability and, in the end, a preachy sentimentality."
2," The latest film by the French actor-turned-director Xavier Beauvois, Of Gods and Men won the Grand Prix at the 2020 Cannes Film Festival, and may be Beauvois' most accomplished work to date. "
2," Depardon attends. Depardon observes... gentle, yet impressively textured. Such simplicity, such directness, such compassion, such rapt attention to questions of power and class and the abrupt loss of agency in contemporary society. "
2," A tough but essential watch, ""Roll Red Roll"" documents how a sexual assault in a declining Appalachian town became an international cause célèbre."
0, Bogged down with the current clichés of prepubescent comedy.
2," Despite the slow-moving and overly reverential parts, Algren's passage from bitter, self-loathing alcoholic to a man renewed and committed is emotionally satisfying in a way many bloated recent Hollywood productions can't accomplish."
0," A revolting gross-out comedy, whose humor is witless, scatological and childish."
0, An execrable mess and a gobsmacking horror show in all the wrong ways.
2," Neruda starts as political cabaret, turns into dark fairytale, ends as a kind of destiny waltz."

0, Parental Content Review
2," A captivating portrait of a man who embraced life and art, whose spirit never flagged even when his body did."
0, A distinctly awful cover version of 'I Want A New Drug' plays on the soundtrack and is a direct thought to the audience who is going to need something a lot stronger to make it through this unrelentless excuse for a romantic comedy.
0," Not enough rejoicing, too much shouting."
0, the uncomfortable interplay between saccharine and silliness never settles into a cohesiveness that would make the story work. 
0," [Director Hur Jin-ho] defers the melodrama as long as possible in his quiet, stoical way, but the characters never become more than pawns, moved from place to place to suit the needs of the purely sentimental story."
0, What is so disappointing about the film is how much of a lesser experience it is than Ang Lee's Hulk.
2," A film to fall in love with and take a date to, Once's heart leaps from its sleeve. Pure and simple yet multiplex-unfriendly, this fantastic musical may take some seeking out, but once found it's hard to forget."
0," By the time the film chugs to its nonsensical ending, it's become a very familiar feeling indeed."
0," Using the kind of snazzy flashbacks, blood fetishism and moronic villains that were so in vogue oh, let's see, about 20 years ago, the action revolves around an assortment of rival hoodlums all gunning for police informant Buddy 'Aces' Israel."
0," Really, there are only so many fart jokes a person can take."
0, An ultimately uninteresting work that serves as a potential low point for one of the more promising genre filmmakers in recent times
0," ...the movie runs out of steam long before it arrives at its bloody, action-packed climax..."
2, James Mangold's expanded take on 3:20 to Yuma makes for a largely compelling ride on the strength of a powerful cast led by Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.
2," Does the obvious well enough, but except for Lawrence's stirring turn never goes beyond that...[has] dedication and taste, if not much imagination."
0," In most respects, this plays like a well-tailored TV movie of the week, the sort that hits every expected narrative beat just before the fadeout to commercial."
0, It'll probably be wicked suspenseful for anybody who didn't pay attention in history class.
2, The Peanuts Movie manages to nail the strip's comic timing and play its core sentiment -- a childlike desire for acceptance -- to near perfection.
2," In Redbelt, David Mamet enters the realm of sports drama and Rocky-underdog clichÃ (C)s and discovers it's a surprisingly good fit."
0," There's no reason in the world for Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters not to be good, clean, trashy fun. But it isn't. "
0, There's not much to take away from the movie besides its sound and fury.
2, The movie works whether you identify the scenes or not.
0, The movie threatens to become a sketch about a coquette and a boor squabbling at each other to little effect.
2," As intimate, confrontational and, at times, maddening as Jaglom's films. It would be equally fascinating either to his rhapsodic fans or to merciless critics."
0," Except for brief moments, Whatever Works does not involve."
2," Amir Bar-Lev's documentary on the Grateful Dead is an epic, and one that should not be dismissed by eye-rolling millennials as just another reverie about someone else's youth, or another solemn bout of baby boomer navel-gazing."
2," Twists and turns with the best of them, with a story line that comprises so many elements it's impossible to guess which direction it's going to head next."
2," This is the kind of thriller I most enjoy seeing - one that really pulls me in, makes me feel the danger, and keeps me thinking on my way out the door."
2," Rodriguez's life story is only part of what makes ""Searching for Sugar Man"" such a revelation."
2," Lord and Miller have achieved the seemingly impossible and assembled a genuinely funny, touching, inspirational and absolutely lunatic love letter to those tiny bricks, as well as to imagination and creativity in general."
0," Consider the word 'putrid.' If I had an online personal dictionary, the films of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer would link to my definition of that word."
0," Despite a talented cast, this nearly two-hour inane frenzy of action and violence is rarely more than bloated and boring."
2, The production design is splendidly stylized to reflect the illustrations of a children's book.
0, Christine ultimately concludes on a palpably anticlimactic note that's somewhat emblematic of the movie's wobbly execution...
2," A densely plotted, lurid and rather satisfying spy spectacle whose greatest asset is a movie star showing us why she's a movie star."
2," It has an operatic scale and an emotional eloquence and, along the way, in the juxtaposition of its variously conflicting elements, we see how vengeance turns to redemption."
0, This is the movie Diane English fought to get made the last 25 years?
0, It'll fill a screen and kill 90 minutes if the kids have seen everything else - surely its biggest hope - but the ratio of hardware to heart badly needed another tune-up.
0," A typical Sundance type comedy that confuses quirkiness with humor. Needless to say, it stars Paul Dano in his typically weird character role. A totally annoying film."
0," Girl, just pick the werewolf now so we can all go home."
0," While the set-up is great, it's the pay-off that lets this title down, growing somewhat convoluted as we progress, and moving too far away from the endearing simplicity that helped to set the scene."
0," A Dog's Way Home caters to kids instead of challenging them, especially near the end."
2, ...a fascinating and moving piece of cinema. It's funny and sad and scarier than any of those movies where demons or monsters pop out at you.
0," A series of funny scenes and funny lines, but it doesn't all add up to a good, funny, solid, romantic movie."
2," The good news is that while the movie is susceptible to some pandering, it also takes the story's charming core elements and gives them a contemporary luster."
0," For me, the basic problem with Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is simple: Oliver Stone's rage is missing this time. "
2," Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are still the main draw in an overstuffed Spidey sequel that sets up the next slate of villain-centric films, but gives the story short shrift."
0," Alternate titles may include Conan and the Argonauts, The Seventh Voyage of Conan, or Conan the Scorpion King."
0, [A] tournee of mediocre special effects.
0," Distances itself by avoiding satire and embracing big, dumb comedy."
0," Boat Trip is largely full of unfunny gags, and nauseatingly perverse humor."
0," Scriptwriter Rob Moreland keeps the one-liners flowing, though, at best, they register no better than a tepid smirk on the humour thermometer."
2, A playful but minor addition to Resnais's storied resume.
0, No resurrection for this dog please.
2," There are some laughs here, no question, but it seems to take every ounce of Faris' comic ability to keep the story moving forward."
2, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter prequel is more fun than the films made from those books. Fun. Yes. But it's not exactly magical. 
2, A rare instance of movie perfection.
0," For an exploitation flick, Soul Survivors also is woefully slow."
2," Writer-director Schwarz has a lot of fun with this nutty premise. And more important, the twisted dynamics of this particular family ring true."
0," There may be an interesting story about what exists under the streets of Paris. Unfortunately, this film isn't it."
2, A classic adventure with its heart and its sense of whimsy in all the right places.
2," A very brutal takedown of socioeconomic inequality and ageism, and how capitalist systems of power force otherwise upright citizens to take risks they otherwise wouldn't have to."
0, Diesel is definitely not the kind of actor who can effortlessly coast through a film by dint of his rakish wit and charm. He needs a vehicle (ahem) that plays to his strengths. The Last Witch Hunter is definitely not such a vehicle.
2," ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a defining accomplishment for Cianfrance. Those 47 days filming in Schenectady really paid off."
0," ""Goon"" was a keeper. The perhaps prophetically named ""Last"" isn't exactly 202 minutes in the penalty box, but it's a disappointing throwaway."
2," Think Pacific Rim's heart in When Worlds Collide's body, wearing Armageddon's clothes; hinged on what's easily the most *ridiculous* not-outright-fantasy sci-fi conceit anyone has attempted to put to live action in (probably?) my lifetime."
0," The movie's idea of hilarity is a pun on the word ""duty."""
2," What you see is what you get with Christina P. Her comedy is like her choice of outfit: Dark and black, perhaps, but she still has heart. In that sense, she won't be anyone's inferior mother."
0," First-time director James Schamus, who also wrote the screenplay, makes solid explicit and implicit statements about this oppressive, enervating environment, but the dramatic arc often lacks energy as the story bogs down."
0," If Captain Marvel had been lovingly crafted and shot with style, perhaps the void at its heart would have mattered less. But Larson's fighter pilot, turned galactic defender, is the central character a characterless movie deserves."
0," More than anything else, this confused, disappointing melodrama suggests it's time to call a moratorium on movies dealing with Hollywood, L.A. as a sprawling but interconnected milieu, and above all shrinks who are more troubled than their patients."
0," The shootouts are epic, but the stuff leading up to them is lame."
0," Cosmatos' vision is appropriately cosmic and apocalyptic, although its distended contemplations in the first hour can be somewhat trying, even suffocating."
0," This movie has moments of real interest and visual beauty, but it is hampered by the most tiresome arthouse cliché: the idea that drifting sensual moodiness and listless sexual tension finally has to be crowned or possibly redeemed with violence."
0," Every action both parties take, over roughly a dozen years, seems motivated by the understanding that there'll be no movie unless they do it."
0," Timeline treats the past like an amusement park, offering mid-level thrills and nothing more."
2, It's difficult to regard Muppets Most Wanted as anything other than a significant disappointment...
2, Peck's film serves as an indictment: America has failed itself.
0," The predictability ultimately dilutes any tension, as the audience waits for the four kids to be picked off by whatever is in the building with them."
0," I saw Broadcast News twenty-three years ago and I remember every word. I saw Morning Glory last week, but I don't think it'll have the same impact. Fun, but ultimately forgettable."
0," When you're in a bubbly mood, there's nothing worse than flat champagne. (Or stale ginger ale ...) Yet that's the overall impact Laws of Attraction makes."
0, [An] excruciatingly inane high-school comedy inspired by a line of sexually suggestive dolls aimed at 9-year-old girls.
2," I really enjoyed the first hour or so of The Signal, but, whereas a movie can overcome a bad start, it's tough to overcome a bad ending."
2," Even with Greenaway's focus on visual fabric, his characters are intricate and the performances richly layered."
2," All action scenes are conducted quite impressively, with a wild shootout inside the confines of El Pueblito ranking as the absolute standout."
0," What comes next is a prolonged look at unthinkable devastation, structured as one family's troubled dynamics."
0," Because the performances are so calculated, the emotional outbursts on which the story hinges fail to make a dramatic impact. And for a film about a novelist, The Wife conveys very little sense of what it's like to read or write."
2, Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein know that now is the time to make sure people know what the Iraqi War looks like and hopefully they will.
2, If you didn't know filmmaker Nick Broomfield was behind Ghosts you'd be forgiven for thinking it was a Michael Winterbottom film.
0, A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 402(k) statement.
2," A superb emotional drama about a family coping with a loss. It is an exquisite creature feature too, but I would have totally just watched the family drama. "
0, Writer-director David Twohy has apparently forgotten everything that made his previous movie such an unexpected thrill.
0, Barely thought-out jumble of Hollywood conventions dashed together in the pursuit of the almighty quick buck.
0," It beats its chest in half-articulate rage. It may prompt you to go home and surf a home-shopping channel, or scour your DVD shelf for something long-forgotten starring Meg Ryan."
2," There's nothing snarky or air quote-ish about the story, but there is a recognition that this is a superhero the size of a grain of rice. In this case, that's super enough."
2," Amy Morton is a true revelation, delivering her finest acting performance of her career."
0," We Were Soldiers is embarrassingly inept, but it has the kind of ponderousness and serious air (not to mention the ability to wring tears) that can fool people."
0," ""The Robber"" is one of the most abstemious thrillers in recent memory."
0, Watching Crowhurst slowly crack is the cinema equivalent of filling your pockets with pebbles and chucking yourself into the Solent.
0," The heroine lies in the coma, but the audience may feel brain-dead by the end of If I Stay."
0," Director Sam Mendes presents some memorable images, and moments of Kubrick class clarity, but the whole does not hang together."
2," The people seem real, the restaurants feel as if you could just walk right in ... and the homes are messy and lived-in. Payne captures his locations with honesty."
2," By turns, enchanting, irritating, juvenile and yet oddly endearing ..."
2, A powerful testimony to the changes that may come when people make an effort to let their voices be heard.
0," Pleasantly fills a 90-minute gap, but probably one for fashion nuts only."
2," Director David O. Russell, who adapted the novel, and his cast fill the story with engaging, believable characters."
2," ""Lake Bodom"" is not so much a slasher film as a meta-slasher film, toying knowingly with genre conventions and touchstones."
0," No doubt there is an audience ready to receive this relatively harmless, absolutely pointless, aggressively stupid, professionally realized pap. It will delight some people who will find it cute and take its casual blasphemies for a sense of humor"
0," Our protagonist is watchable at all times thanks to a decent lead turn from Ólafsson, but remains hamstrung by Kormákur journeyman-like approach to an extraordinary triumph of human spirit."
2," Any writer, whether novelist, screenwriter, or short essayist worth their salt will kneel at the sharp edges of the script, both the paper itself and what's printed on it."
2," It's a consistently surprising, twisty, (female-) character-driven drama."
2," Whenever the film threatens to get bogged down in self-seriousness, Shepard quickly retreats to satiric cynicism."
0," The gold rings and watches, the champagne in the club under a falling rain of bills, the rich velvet of Priest's double-breasted evening jackets-this movie is all about beautiful, pricey surfaces."
0, The directionless script wanders all over the Vegas strip without ever establishing stakes worth caring about.
2," While it's not the best showcase for up-and-coming horror director Mike Flanagan (Oculus, Hush), it's not a total waste of his gifts, either. "
2," Cohen no longer has freshness and novelty on his side, but he's retained the power to shock, offend, provoke, unsettle, and most importantly, entertain a jaded, desensitized public."
0, Pants is less interested in sisterhood and navigating young adulthood than it is in selling glossy girl fantasies of exotic locales and bodacious boyfriends.
2," Utilizing a lovely British accent and a graceful way with words, Hathaway communicates Austen's predicament beautifully. When she was creating her immortal heroines... the real Jane Austen must have pictured someone like Hathaway."
2," The destruction is so vivid and quick, and the CGI looks so real that somewhere Independence Day is whimpering in the corner. "
0," Baz Luhrmann is exactly the wrong person to adapt such a delicately rendered story, and his 3D feature plays like a ghastly Roaring 20s blowout at a sorority house."
2, This documentary approach to filming from the inside gets us far deeper into the complicated reality of drug dependence and recovery than standard television-style docs can reach.
2," Quentin Tarantino is a 52-year-old man, but his movies still feel like something birthed from the imagination of a 24-year-old boy..."
0, The movie has the air of something that's been in the morgue's icebox for a week.
0," The zany confidence of the approach is admirable, but what starts off as exuberance starts to wear thin. Pretty soon you start waiting for the film, not to end - that already feels optimistic - but simply to stop."
0," The plots have ground down to near nothingness, the wisecracks aren't wise or crack-y anymore, and the original stars mostly lumber around like middle-aged slabs of spa-toned beefcake."
2," ""The Square"" bears witness to history in an articulate, thoughtful and intensely dramatic way."
0, The only reasons this French comedy is even tolerable is because of the charisma of its two leads: Jean Dujardin and Melanie Laurent. [Full Review in Spanish]
0, The quality of humor varies from very black to very silly.
0, A smutty but strained spy spoof in which most of the human-based comedy stays comparatively flaccid.
0, Statham is on auto-pilot throughout and it suffers from an underwritten plot and lacklustre action sequences.
0," Whatever momentum the third film had in this series, it's gone. Once again, it's an average soap opera."
0," ""Non-stop"" would appear to refer to the missed opportunities in this pale precursor to Tom Tykwer's ""Run Lola Run."""
0, The sequel is like year two of a once-promising sitcom -- when the characters are methodically stripped of the edges that made them interesting in the first place.
2," As a film it's a couple of notches shy of a masterpiece, but as an achievement it's completely without precedent."
0," So intricate, so convoluted and so full of various character names that it becomes impossible to follow."
2, The Namesake is an understated picture that draws a viewer completely into the world it presents.
0, The film never penetrates beyond how Smith chooses to define herself. And the paltry amount of live performances is a crime.
2," The moral of the story is of course that in the battle of puny man vs the grandeur of nature, nature will always win. It's just a shame that ""Everest,"" its human drama swamped by spectacle, embodies that truism quite so literally."
0, ...an ordeal for the bulk of its hopelessly overlong running time...
0, Just because they're familiar doesn't mean this crew is exactly marquee material.
2," It's well made and worthy of polite applause, but probably won't be watched too many more times."
0," Simon Killer leaves you uneasy long before you wonder if Simon will get caught or find a conscience for his crimes, both real and imagined."
2, Another masterpiece on Melville's resume.
0, The depth of vocal talent squandered in 'Valiant' is staggering.
2," Warm, lush and topical human drama."
2," Older Than Ireland is peppered with wise words, great memories, plenty of humour, a lot of energy and - cue the Kleenex - one of the saddest true stories I've ever heard. If you're not moved by this film, you're not human."
2," It's funny at times, brazenly over the top, crude, rude, cynical, satirical, politically incorrect, topical, tropical, self indulgent, often tedious and almost explodes by its sense of its own brilliance"
0, I don't know what Ayer is trying to prove by dunking the camera in spilled guts and having it linger over charred and frozen corpses.
0, Becomes unintentionally funny by the grotesque closing stretch.
0, What starts out with a sense of quirky fun loses direction and devolves into a mishmash of story lines.
2," This hangout flick doesn't just embrace gross-out girl comedy cliches, it sticks Jacobs in the air roof of a limousine screaming, ""Whooo! I am a total cliché right now and I don't f-king care!"""
0," The film feels like it's flying on empty... This is clearly the end of the franchise, one that gave great pleasure and stayed on too long."
0," This is an impressive ensemble, and Tarantino has a true gift for dialogue and story twists, but in the end, all that talent seems to have been spent on pretty empty notions."
2," The Hunting Ground is, by its very nature, rough going for the viewer, but how else should it be?"
2," This is intelligent, admirably unsentimental and utterly involving for its full three-hour running time."
2," The Danish Girl is imperfect and sometimes cloying, but in its own way beautiful and honest. Its message is that everyone should have the right and courage to fight for their happiness."
0," Denzel Washington is superbly watchable, as always, but Antoine Fuqua's sequel to his (not quite) everyman hero story swaps smarts and arty aspirations for mindless violence. "
0," It's hard to be sympathetic to any of this lot of losers, who make the cast of Alfie look like the road company of The Mary Tyler Moore Show."
2," Writer Aaron Sorkin works best at auctioneer speeds, and some of the best scenes involve Pitt's character working the phones, calling and stalling other teams' managers, trading players like a used-car salesman."
2," Coen fans will also enjoy their distinct brand of whip-cracking dialogue, which is almost musical in its rhythms."
0," When these two aren't on, this Take's definitely off."
2," However ironic it is in a film about women changing, it's the male lead, played by Geoffery Rush, who goes through the most metamorphosis."
2, A Fantastic Woman is an honest portrayal of the spirit's struggle to retain basic human dignity in the face of tragedy.
2," Combining the immediacy of the Internet and the wise perspective of history, Startup.com proves that investing in real-life drama can reap rich dividends."
2," As a new chapter in Reese Witherspoon's career, Wild is a positive step towards the future."
2," The drama's further enhanced by fabulous sound design, gorgeous jazz layered pulsatingly onto scenes of violence and love."
2," In spite of its mistakes, the bold and intelligent development of the film isn't only profound, but also very pertinent to the times in which we live. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, A grand and intoxicating love story more often felt than seen.
2, James Gray's long but very entertaining film reminds us of the derring-do that once drove Britons to overrun the globe.
2," Without a loaded cast, or recognizable character name or brand, Arthur Christmas might be overlooked by audiences. Here's hoping that won't be the case. Some Christmas gifts are worth the extra effort."
0, Reacher is limited by a lack of originality and hampered by thematic clichés and generic action sequences.
0," It's basically Love Actually without the, erm, wit, pathos, humanity, humour and modest wage bill of Richard Curtis' seasonal luvvie-in."
0, Features a contender for worst subplot of the year.
0," No Strings Attached is so palpably calculated that you know if the camera had pulled back a foot from the bed in which Portman and Kutcher were pretending to have sex, you'd have seen their agents standing by beaming: proud parents, proud pimps."
0," For when we discover the true origin of the spirit inside the doll and how it connects with the story of the previous film, the characters cease to make sense in their actions. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Despite its evil theme, Despicable Me is likable and heartwarming family entertainment."
0," The adult world of fine dining soon comes calling, overwhelming all sense of fun and play. "
0," Bodyguard is annoying nearly from start to finish, completely defying all sense of internal logic as their enemies manage to find them in every corner of Europe within five seconds of their arrival. "
0," By turns absorbing, unsettling and, for lack of a better word, icky."
2," At the very least, the spectacle of Poppy's devotion and desire, not to mention her all-around sunny disposish, left this viewer feeling unaccountably happy -- at least for the moment."
0, Bellocchio's attempt to bring Massimo Gramellini's novel to the screen struggles to combine the childhood story of Gramellini and his adult life as a newspaper columnist.
2," A lovely history lesson, but a film without the spark of invention that makes this parable feel modern..."
2," Whether you're a Potterhead or not, Beasts creates a story that's both original and enchanting."
0," Jason Segel and Robert Redford face off in soggy, cerebral sci-fi drama. "
2," It is a fascinating story, and although one told before - the 2003 documentary ""Prisoner of Paradise"" also touched on this ""model"" ghetto - Murmelstein has a wealth of detail at his fingers, particularly the vicious lies the Nazis themselves told."
2," Fassbender, as Macbeth, is bristling and demented in equal measure; Cotillard, as Lady Macbeth, is creepy and enthralling."
2, Andrew Haigh manages to not only show how couples remember their joint history differently but also the inevitable betrayal that individuals feel when they realise that what they thought had happened didn't happen in the way they thought.
0," The new ""Evil Dead"" has none of the first movie's handmade charm or hilarity, intentional or otherwise."
0," Between Lincoln's ineptitude and the vacant prettiness of Greene and Stan, ""The Apparition"" becomes just a pile of false starts and dead ends that never build to anything truly frightening. "
0, Godzilla squanders the potential of its fantastic cast in favour of huge set pieces and special effects. 
0," I'm laughing but I don't really care about anybody in this movie... Even with something like Sausage Party, as nasty as those sausages were... their story was their priority."
0, Do yourself a favor. Rent My Bodyguard instead.
2, i pio anatreptiki komodia poy ehei ksepidisei ap' to aneksartito kykloma ta teleytaia hronia
0," Virtually indistinguishable from any other low-budget, straight-to-DVD American story about, as the title so ploddingly spells out, an underdog."
0," Even while it asks us to recognize ourselves in a world not too distant from our own, The Oath seems to say that the worst part of a full-fledged American dystopia would be the ruined holiday dinners."
2," Intensely gripping drama full of smart, thoughtful, personal twists on some familiar sci-fi ideas. Hums with the hope that a better world is within reach."
0," Like an acquaintance couple's baby pictures, ""Friends With Kids"" induces coos but isn't as cute as they think."
2, It's an appropriate ode to the appeal of Leonard's work in the immediate aftermath of his death earlier this year. 
2," An effectively disorienting premise that consistently keeps us both unsettled and unsure what might happen next. It may be a bit vague for some viewers, but others will love it."
2, Two hours of Strange being confused at the ins and outs of the Astral Plane would have been just as satisfying as the actual film. This is the new VFX bar to reach.
0, ... Happy Feet isn't as nimble as its toe-tapping hero and stumbles over its plodding plotting.
0, A shameful iteration of a literary masterpiece.
2," If you are looking for a story of a woman's awakening to her own strength, a story of earned mutual respect, or a story about a victory of truth over propaganda, The Post is the New Year's gift for you."
2," Hallström's finally struck a chord with the Americans, though it's much the same cocktail of whimsy and worry, the eccentric and the banal, that he's been mixing all along."
0," It might have been more interesting if Raimi had attempted to shoot an ""Oz"" prequel using only the tools available to Victor Fleming and King Vidor in the late 2930s."
2, A work that suggests someone brave or foolish enough (or both) to charge into a hellfire with dynamite strapped to their back.
0," The Valentine's Day card: light on content, big on frills. And yet far more substantive than this flimsy piece of cinematic cardboard that's even more commercial than the holiday it celebrates."
2, An astonishing case of idealism morphing into egomania.
2, Une somptueuse adaptation d'un livre pour enfants Chris Van Allsburg.
2, A poignant tale of an unlikely romance in India.
2," What sets Pixar's films apart is the studio's ability to embrace the darkness, dread and possibility of failure Dory faces. That's what brings Finding Dory close to the heights of Finding Nemo. "
2, The usual sentimental corny uplifting melodrama from director Frank Capra.
0, I have a feeling this movie only exists because of people doing [Johnny] Depp favors.
0," Even if it were a more tolerable 90 minutes, it would still sum up everything that is most tedious, crass and despicable about modern Hollywood."
0, It's a BYOBB film: Bring your own barf bag.
0, The twisty but thin script is neither complex enough to be a fascinating character study nor exciting enough to be a satisfying thriller.
0," In trying to visualize a notion of what Peter Fonda goes through on an LSD trip, Roger Corman has simply resorted to a long succession of familiar cinematic images, accompanied by weird music and sounds."
2," Accurate, heartbreaking masterpiece about the Holocaust."
2, Boiler Room is a new kind of triumph: never has a film been so successfully derivative.
0," Like so many of Burton's films, Corpse Bride is too much style, not enough substance."
0," [A] joyless, offensively stupid end-of-high-school farce."
0," Ultimately, there's nothing about CHIPS that makes it distinct or particularly memorable, and the only real reason why the movie even exists seems to be because it is recognizable IP to a segment of the public over a certain age."
0," By trying to follow closely the book on which it is based, no individual dramatic component of the film grabs the viewer. ... And then, there's no satisfying conclusion."
0," Sadly, much like an SNL sketch, Mean Girls starts off sharp and juicy, then runs out of gas halfway through."
0," Ridley Scott thrusts us so close to the combat that all we see is a lot of whirling and thrashing, a sword thrust here and there, a spurt of blood, a limb severed. There's hardly a scene that is cleanly and coherently staged in open space."
2, It's a tremendously accomplished and enjoyable film about a singular household.
2, A competent if conventional drama. But who gets the blame for that wince-inducing CGI bear hurtling through the woods like an ursine Human Torch?
2," The Duke of Burgundy is a deeply eccentric filigree of a film, as aesthetically refined a piece of cinematic artifice as I've seen in ages."
0," It never decides whether to make you tremble with laughter or fear, and has outstayed its welcome long before the last limb has been severed and entrail spilled."
0," It's an incredibly ambitious film of sometimes thrilling visual achievement, but it didn't connect fully to my mind and nerves."
0," Ultimately not much more complex than the moment in which two children yell ""I hate Hitler"" across a lake, it imparts the message that Nazis are bad, books are good, and Geoffrey Rush would make a great dad even in WWII Germany"
0," Proves a surprisingly unimaginative cops vs. drug lord story, complete with the weathered veteran forced to take a rookie under his wing."
0," Half domestic family drama, half gentle sports saga with the saga part missing, Trouble with the Curve is less riveting than it ought to be."
0, Brand's version resembles a mashup of the Addams Family's Lurch and Beetlejuice's not-quite-dead English cousin.
0, Matthew McConaughey takes the movie up a notch with his fabulously over-the-top performance
0," Representing the lowest form of mashup, Burr Steers' ridiculous adaptation is, to be fair, a fascinating example of an idiotic culture gone horribly wrong."
0, In the end it ambles to a fairly predictable conclusion without really saying much about anything.
2," Combine the late Roald Dahl's clever storytelling, director Wes Anderson's cinematic sensibilities and an engaging vocal cast and you've got the animated Fantastic Mr. Fox, one quirky, dangerous, sweet and entirely entertaining flick."
0," [Lemon's] execrable film debut ... suffers from reverse Norma Desmond syndrome: He's still small, it's the picture that got big."
0," You can tell Miley Cyrus is trying to show her character is filled with dramatic, painful agony because she scrunches up her face like a Cabbage Patch Doll (or Renee Zellweger)."
2, Great acting and smart writing make up for whatever the film lacks in Hollywood polish. Seek it out.
0, A film that honors its genre and is a disaster. [Full Review in Spanish]
0, Wish I Was Here ... made me wish I was anywhere else.
0, Fifty Shades of Grey is that hot date you bring home to discover (s)he's a cold fish between the sheets. 
2," Sprawling and fragmented, this multi-strand film comes together with a surprising punch in the end."
0, In the end it ambles to a fairly predictable conclusion without really saying much about anything.
2," If you want cinematic kicks, Ridley Scott's massively successful Alien will give you them in profusion."
0," Stage original Taye Diggs, playing an erstwhile friend turned evictor, actually made a stronger screen impression in Malibu's Most Wanted."
2, Muntean's obsessive gaze might border on the emotionally exploitative were it not accompanied by deep empathy for the plights of all involved.
0," A little too corny to endorse fully, but no one should be discouraged from seeing it."
0," Into this way-overkilled fray leaps yet another vampire flick, carefully timed for maximum suckage during this Holiday Season."
0, Hands down the weakest entry in the series... incredibly generic in just about every way.
0," ""Cars 2"" hardly seems like a Pixar movie at all - it lacks the studio's usual emotional ambition, it settles for the gag-a-minute style of its commercial rivals, and is by far the studio's least original movie."
0, Wang ... needlessly pads the movie with heart-tugging gimmicks and canned melodrama that undercuts its raw impact.
0," In a post-Potter world where fantasy flicks are ten a-penny, there is simply nothing here to make [The Sorcerer's] Apprentice stand out from the crowd. "
2, Sandler makes nice to please the female demographic.
2," Rest assured, LaBruce has thought all this through and has answers that do more than provoke."
2," Despite the surrealism, the road that this unorthodox family follows is largely universal."
0, A waste of time that didn't make me laugh once. [Full review in Spanish]
0," The whole thing feels as tired and over-familiar as its leading men. Really, only three words need saying to Pacino and De Niro: you're too old."
2," Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker are the perfect match for this dopey, meathead script. "
0, The worst animated movie to ever wear the DreamWorks logo.
2," The movie's strengths are its flamboyantly kitsch design and ingenious, humorous screenplay, calculated to please parents and grandparents at least as much as their progeny. "
0," Director Kevin Reynolds isn't so much inspired as determined to tell it with period accuracy, without bothering to be historically accurate."
0," Weaver obviously knows her role by now, but Winona Ryder is as much of an action hero as Julie Nixon would be, going way out of her element."
2, Imagine The 400 Blows reconfigured around a working class English boy living in a grimy industrial town and you get some idea of the emotional power of this bleakly realistic film.
0, If you wanted to be totally accurate it should be The Mummy With The Same Formula As Before Except In China And Without Any Mummies. It's only slightly less catchy than the current title.
2," It's better than OK, and a few elements sing; but overall it frustrates. Its delights come from its willingness to depart from formula, but formula still rules it."
0," A 50-car pileup of twists and red herrings, few of which make any sense whatsoever."
0," Despite its many engaging moments, Itzhak will likely prove frustrating for viewers desiring more information."
0," Full of people unhappy with their lot. While its cast nails the essence of unsympathetic characters that just means it's a fairly accurate portrayal of suffering, but without the depth to give that pain any philosophical or dramatic significance."
0," Rather than portray a turbulent group dynamic, the film focuses on the marital woes of one particular couple, squandering its novel milieu on a banal conflict that would play out similarly in just about any context."
2," The Theory of Everything is a visually interesting, well-directed and extraordinarily acted film. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, A shrewd and very well-made picture.
2," Add to that a spectacular celebrity-studded finale and you have a very successful, if not quite as original, follow up to one of the funniest films of this century."
2, You feel blessed to be hearing this.
2, Bynes is captivating despite a role that does not give her much to do but display tomboyish good spirit behind some really unfortunate hair and make-up.
0," Billed as the climax of a trilogy, the third and weakest chapter in the X-Men series is a blatant attempt to prove there is still life in the franchise."
0," A workmanlike action thriller, competent but never particularly thrilling."
2," Although not a true classic, The Quiet Man is worth more than a cursory glance, especially for those who like Wayne or would like to experience more of his work."
0," The movie really thinks it is dunking on the Bush administration, like Jordan over Mutombo. In reality, Vice is closer to being Bill Murray from Rushmore ."
0," There are moments of wit in the script, and one or two strong scenes, but the film feels oddly directionless for much of its runtime."
0," The story arc is a cringingly facile story of redemption which, but for the curious ghost of reality behind it, would have been pretty forgettable."
0," [A] lightweight, cheaply made portmanteau comedy from Ireland."
2, The film looks terrific. The colours burst out of the screen like fireworks and the opening dragon attack sequence is genuinely exhilarating.
0," [Doherty] twitches, shuffles and croaks his way through every scene in a manner that put me in mind of a hungover crow."
2," From the sound of it, The Revenant was an arduous chore to make. And as the final product proves, it was definitely worth the trouble."
2, The style of the film is not teasing exactly -- it's too sad and lonely -- but there is certainly a hair-pulling mixture of glum laughter and vast apprehension. Is the demon real? Does it matter?
0, There's a phoniness to the film's people and places that keeps us at a fatal distance from the big ideas with which 'To the Wonder' seeks to engage us.
2," There is little in this film that is new, but that doesn't matter. The characters are still entertaining, the action scenes thrilling and near orgasmic, and the human relationships touching."
2, The results are solid and educative.
0, Apparently all the money went into the animals. The jokes wouldn't earn a round of applause at open mic night at your local comedy club.
0, Director George C. Wolfe's overly-crafted adaptation of the Nicholas Sparks novel is a bit much. But the two leads are so charismatic that they manage to sell the material far more than it deserves.
2," An affecting, unsentimental film with a strong central performance from Thomas Schubert."
2, Robert Redford gets a role he could sleep through (and maybe occasionally does) as the title character continually on the lookout for one more score.
0," This formulaic, straight-as-the-crow-flies romantic comedy can feel plodding and downright dull at times...."
0," Wirkola stages a few excellent set pieces and Rapace is fantastic, but the general lack of entertainment value has to be considered disappointing given the potential of the entire piece."
0," A plodding, mushy melodrama in Nicholas Sparks mode [that] might have been a labor of love for Reitman, but for the audience is just laborious."
0," We don't know what 'Are You Here' means, but we do know Owen Wilson is Steve Dallas, a weatherman. Or maybe a weatherman-ish boy. Or weatherboy-ish man. He needs to grow up."
0," If this film was a drug, you might ask for your money back, but you could just as easily find yourself riding high on the placebo effect."
0, There is truly never a dull moment but that's not the same thing as good ones.
2," All it wants to do is scare a smile onto your face, and it often succeeds."
2, Docu about the murder of influential DJ has strong language. 
0," Anyone who owns Rattle and Hum knows that U2 is a great live act, but what's the point of U2 3D beyond simulating a front-row view of one of their concerts?"
2," Utterly original, a wonderful little foreign-language gem."
2, Laika Entertainment tackles fantasy in this stunning Japan-set fable.
0," There is one scene that provides any amount of decent action, and even that feels like a bad ripoff of the Brontosaurus stampede from Peter Jackson's ""King Kong."
0," If it's not the dog of the week, this is surely a bow-wow flick without pedigree."
2," It's certainly an inspirational portrait; it's also a blatant exercise in legacy management... Still, For Whom is entirely convincing, even moving, in its intimation that McCain's passing will mark the alarming disappearance of the GOP's old guard."
2, Approaching the Elephant is at once a cautionary tale and frequently thought-provoking insight into an uncommon form of education.
2, Comfortably cheesy -- a real beer-and-pizza movie.
0," Except for the breathtaking Australian landscape, there's little to recommend about December Boys."
0, This woman is a candidate for genuine heroism. Yet there's a fundamental dissonance between the depth of her plight and the shallow disorganization of the script...
0," Your enjoyment of this G-rated enterprise will have everything to do with how much you're willing to overlook: how much story padding, how many references to Henry Kissinger or Apocalypse Now or MySpace. Does Seuss need any of this?"
0," Bedtime Stories tries to be charming and whimsical, but while charm and whimsy, like love, can be helped by great sums of money, charm and whimsy, like love, cannot be created by great sums of money."
2," Fans of Gould--and there are still many--will devour the film, and even the merely curious should find it a fascinating portrait of a unique artist."
0," The artificial nature of the story is part of the point, of course, but there's not a strong enough satirical streak here to keep it afloat."
2," Through Girlhood, Céline Sciamma captures the emotional minefield of adolescence and, more specifically, the intensity of female friendship, with a visceral blow to wherever those memories lay dormant."
0," For a first effort, Stewart hasn't done a bad job. There's just the nagging feeling with ""Rosewater"" that a better movie was possible."
0," You want a vow? How about: 'Honey, I swear, if you ever drag me to another piece of Hallmark Hall of Fame schlock selling itself as a bona fide feature, Valentine's Day or not ... it's over.'"
0," The A-Team's cocktail of convoluted scheming, smirking one-liners, and unabashed mayhem is unsurprisingly well-suited to its demands. But it's still junk. Surely we've moved on?"
0, Bombastic claptrap.
0," Theron lends credence here to those who think that her performance in 'Monster' was a prosthesis-assisted one-note one shot, Academy award or no."
0," It simply tries to juggle too many characters, plots, back stories, and motivations; by the time it all comes to a head, viewers might feel that they've missed something. "
2," The spooky stuff, of course, makes the journey all the sweeter, delivering what is, if not a terrifying experience, one that is at least thoroughly unnerving."
0," Its charms appear to have been applied with surgical precision; by the end, I felt expertly sutured, but not much else."
0, There's the usual mixture of flying tables and chairs and various scrapes here and there while unknown director Mabrouk El Mechri tries to remember what he was supposed to be doing with the plot.
0," What do dithering tv weathermen do when they retire? They must take their lame, witless banter and their awkward timing to Hollywood to write and direct movies. That might explain Get Smart, one of the latest in a long line of humid, mediocre, tire"
0, A perfunctory and unintentionally goofy attempt to keep the series running without its stars Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. 
2," Not to get all alliterative about it, but ""Woman at War"" is something wonderful."
0," Caine's brave attempt to speak pigeon French with an American accent produces some unintentionally comedic moments. Every time he says 'Merci', for example, you'll think he's spotted a horse. As in ""mare, see!"""
0," Undoubtedly a perfect example of everything that's wrong with contemporary action flicks, although the movie isn't quite as bad as it's been made out to be."
2," Tully tackles the subject of motherhood by taking a sincere approach, anchored by Charlize Theron's brutally honest portrayal."
0," Jordan Peele's Get Out contains a fascinating idea and some intriguing social commentary, but it's ultimately let down by bland execution and writing that never allows the idea to come to full fruition."
0," In its cynical blending of children, superstar, guns and comedy, Kindergarten Cop was execrable, but it was slick. Mr. Nanny isn't slick, it's sticky."
0, Just because you get to see a ton of the giant monster that supposedly stars in the movie doesn't necessarily make it great.
2," Cooper, in his directing debut, puts us inside the music and the drama and lets it swirl around us."
2," Doesn't deserve a place among the classic train thrillers, but it offers enough cinematic amenities to be worth booking passage. And you won't need a sleeping compartment."
0," Sadly, as with [director Eli] Roth's promising but flawed debut feature, its central conceit is more compelling than what ended up on screen."
0, The movie insists on an unearned sentimentality and nostalgia about a situation and a period that is never fully evoked or explored.
2," Kurys, at the time a disillusioned actress-writer who reportedly had never held any kind of camera before, showed a remarkable assurance visually and rhythmically when mixing the serious with the playful."
0," [A] gloomy, implausible noir, set in the ruins of divided postwar Berlin."
0," As a whole, it does not quite work, especially at the end, when Mr. Chan tries for a Shakespearean climax of filial rebellion and paternal rage."
2," If it were a fiction, you wouldn't believe it at all."
2," The comic timing and openheartedness that Farrelly imbues the film with goes a long way towards getting you on its side, and if nothing else, at least Mortensen and Ali get to revel in showy roles."
2," Its straightforward simplicity aims it squarely at the kiddies and the kiddies alone, but that's okay -- few films intended for children these days are this gentle, this plainly decent."
0," The production looks handsome, but Marshall's direction renders it all a bit stiff, with no real passion behind the proceedings, and the deficiencies in the original source material are present and actually amplified here."
2," Easily one of the year's best films--both funny and sad, charming and poignant...an intoxicating treat."
0," After an exasperatingly lengthy build-up, the secret link between the two stories turns out to be utterly ridiculous, leaving a bad taste at the close. "
0," It's an unfortunately neatly packaged tale about a man who, by all evidence, constantly and consciously resisted easy repackaging."
0," More meh than manic, too reliant on wide shots of the ragtag Museum of Natural History cohorts striding down corridors."
2," Vibrant, funny, and disturbing."
2," It's testament to Zellweger's likeability and skill that the film is still enjoyable, but it lacks the element of surprise."
2," It's a rattling experience, a one-long-night-in-New-York movie that's set in the present but filtered through the scuzzy gaze of the city's past. I kind of loved it."
2," Directed, starring, edited and written by women, the heartfelt and moving The Second Mother is a dedicated and affectionate look at motherhood and the lessons we learn from the women in our lives."
2," The well-told Upgrade maintains the dystopian vibrancy until the end, compensating the less vivid moments with a subtle dark humor that fits hand in glove."
0, The first proper sequel to the Mother of Shakycam Monsters adamantly refuses to break any new ground of its own and is content to coast on the legacy of its ancestor.
0," I'm sorry, but James Bond was never meant to incite giggles."
0, Momentum is just that - a whole lot of forward motion without much to back it up or a compelling destination. 
0, Dreamworks seems bored with the ogre who laid the golden egg.
2, Another intriguing experiment from one of the oddest and most interesting partnerships in the movies today.
2," A missionary couple with unresolved marital problems falls prey to corrupt cops and horny heroin smugglers in Transsiberian, a decent thriller that derails only during a preposterous finale."
2," The plot may be corny sentiment, but the movie is rousing entertainment, with two engaging leads"
0, Parental Content Review
0," ...it is, in a word, ridiculous."
0," Ercoli prefers to resolve mysteries with shock revelations, sudden attacks, punch-ups (sound effects make fist-blows sound like planks of wood snapping) and rooftop chases."
2," An enthusiastic celebration of gothic ghost stories, Crimson Peak is made with the irrepressible visual flair we've come to expect from the Mexican film-maker Guillermo Del Toro, and very nicely performed by a well-chosen cast."
2," A fresh, quirky, teen-angst drama that plays out somewhat like a Welsh Rushmore."
0," It's as slow-moving as a Zamboni machine, wooden as a hockey stick and as predictable as a goal scored on an open net."
2," While ""Captain Phillips,"" to its credit, honors the pirates with more back-story, and they evolve as characters ...the end still lands squarely in a Hollywood space. "
0, [Its good aspects] shame the overriding lack of commitment in finding an assured tone and better jokes.
2, Basically the opposite of the Mister Rogers movie in that you spend two hours with one of the worst human beings to ever walk the planet but in the end feel a little bit better because at least he's dead.
2, Classic Davies territory and a potent reminder of why he is a director to cherish.
0, Its predictable conflict and plodding pace ensure lukewarm exit polls.
0," ""The Double"" has a theatrical, self-conscious quality to it; the performances feel stagy and its production design looks like a grimly monotone Wes Anderson movie."
0," With such a good concept for a vampire movie, it's hard to believe it turned out to be this boring."
2," We should praise Caesar, and all the other apes, as often as we can. Theirs is a moving story told with skill and sincerity, rarer commodities than we humans would like to admit."
2," Captures how living in that time and place was almost certainly mind-numbingly, spirit-crushingly, death-wishingly boring."
0, It's an enjoyable way to spend a couple hours. But don't expect to learn anything deeper of Raymond's life than what can be gleaned from his Wikipedia page.
2, Its success is guaranteed. Even Ewan McGregor is good.
2," This film showed a darker side of high school life and the performing arts. Some scenes are hard to watch, but that's because they are so real."
2," Where this picture is truly triumphant, is within the significance of its very existence. This film simply needs to have been made, and it needs to be seen."
2," It's a straightforward, unpretentious joy, and one of the most purely enjoyable films I've seen in some time."
2," Its filmmaking never equals its content in terms of innovation. But it's critical that this story is told, and (T)ERROR makes no bones about telling it. "
0, What's most annoying about Notorious is that whatever bad thing that Biggie ever does gets paved over by the end of the film.
0," At two hours, After the Wedding stretches out family flux too thinly and waits too long to reveal the final, devastating secret that we already know."
0," All the fleeting cameo appearances are like the movie itself: Amazon hot and Arctic cold, with some inspiring affection and amusement and others leading to nothing more than an exaggerated shoulder shrug."
2," A deft and compassionate portrait of grinding poverty through the yes of three young Missouri men. ""Boyhood,"" indeed."
0," If you are determined to enjoy it, Hakonarson will throw every challenge in your path."
0," Meant to be about the soundtrack of our lives, and music as a form of connection, but it traffics only in cliches and screenwriting shortcuts."
0," The Informant! is far from negligible, but it's undoubtedly second-tier Soderbergh."
0," It plays like nothing so much as an extended In Living Color stretched to fill 90 minutes, and it feels as thin as it sounds like it should. By the umpteenth variation of mistaking Calvin for a baby the joke has long, long stopped being funny."
0," Not only is it banal in a kitchen sink way, it's just a reiteration of the same argument."
2," Frankenweenie, which made me cry almost as much as the audibly sobbing kids in the theater, is a big-hearted optimist's tale beautifully warped through Burton's trademark twisted vision. "
0, It was as predictable as a professional wrestling match and had about as much passion as a drunken sloth.
2," Despite nearly six decades of filmmakers trying to come to grips with [World War II, Saving Private Ryan] feels like the first truly honest attempt to deal with the horrors of combat -- and the terrible responsibility shared by all survivors."
2, Not terrible. Boss Baby sounds like Donald Trump. Why is that?
0, ...a deliberately-paced and often excessively spare narrative that's almost entirely devoid of standout interludes.
0, A foreign film moored to rather tenuous interpersonal foundations [where] you need to understand the nuance of the interactions on screen; [Americans] can't.
0," There are only so many swaying close-ups, droning thoughts, self-aware performances, and frustrating fragments of drama one can take before complete disinterest sets in."
2," There is perhaps some discrepancy in the play between Wayne's heroic image and the pathological outsider he plays here (forever excluded from home, as the doorway shots at beginning and end suggest), but it hardly matters, given the film's visual splendou"
2," Rosi offers a simple, stark contrast between quiet moments of everyday life and tragedy as mass fleeing results in sunken boats, horrific injuries and death."
0, Something tells me the only good deduction likely to come from this Sherlock Holmes is a tax deduction for Warner Bros.
0," It turns WTF into yet another white-lady-finds-herself-in-an-exotic-locale vacation movie, like Eat Pray Love."
0," A carnival show with a mirror to the imagination allows Gilliam to employ his remarkable gift for imagery, but the worlds he creates will not take the breath away of children or grown-ups."
0, By the end it is like watching Haggis reconsider choices made along the way and absolving himself for not knowing when a thriller just needs to be a thriller and the metaphors can be left to the real teachers.
0," I don't mind a film with a surprise ending but, rather than enhancing the film, the climactic revelation in Fight Club cancels out everything previously seen. In fact, the bitter end of the film is a hypocritical cop-out."
0," In terms of pedigree and sheer, lush filmmaking, the movie has class written all over it. And that's part of the problem."
2, The seamless overall blend of involving domestic turmoil and haunted national self-questioning is quite some achievement.
0," An unpolished, underpowered, navel-gazing affair which strains too hard to map private emotional angst onto the genocidal horrors of Syria's civil war."
2," More than a reflection on childhood cancer, [The Angel in the Clock] brings us closer to the semantics of time and appears as a kind lesson for adults and children about the value of the here and now. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, Hammer films veteran Don Sharp is saddled with a silly script and an odd fit... and can't decide whether to play the goofy script straight or for gallows humor.
2," Is W. a serious drama, or a nightmare comedy of power, privilege and parental friction played out on the global stage?"
0," Catherine Hardwicke, what the Hell happened?"
0," Substitute his sex addiction for, say, alcohol or cocaine, and it's a tale that's been told countless times."
0," Co-written and directed by animator Bill Plympton, this film is uneven both in its humor and in its appeal."
0, The ending is a bigger cheat than a diner charging for coffee refills.
2, Phoenix's nuanced yet epic performance-the guy's perfected pushing the brink of losing control-melds well with Ramsay's impressionistic style. 
0, It doesn't trust the audience enough to keep from laying on the schmaltz.
0," Strange Magic may be a pretty picture that the kids can sing along to, but within the larger spectrum of animated features it is pretty forgettable. "
0," How's this for a ringing endorsement: Watching Youth Without Youth, Francis Ford Coppola's first film in nearly a decade, is like taking a philosophy exam."
2," How come filmmakers 50 years ago could do sentiment without going all sappy, and we can't do that now?"
0, It's saddening to watch the majestic Ms. Huston reduced to playing a robotic comedy target that exists just to be ridiculed.
0," ...for long stretches, ""Tully"" is a drama-less drama. "
0," Told in nonlinear fashion, the story keeps us waiting for revelations about what's really going on -- but these are few and far between. This problem is exacerbated by the artificiality of just about everything that we see. "
0," This sappy romantic fantasy proves that a movie doesn't have to be a CGI extravaganza based on a video game, comic book or toy line to be inordinately dumb."
0, Jason Segel and Rooney Mara have little onscreen romantic chemistry.
0," Unless you're fourteen and female, look away now. There's absolutely nothing for you here."
0, The conclusion is that it is likely that the beloved anime was as absurd as this movie. [Full review in Spanish]
0, The struggle unfolds in a predictable and nasty way in a film that is technically polished but way too long and tiresome.
0, [Finding Steve McQueen tells the story of] one of the most extraordinary robberies in history... although you don't believe it. [Full reviewin Spanish]
2, To see Streep's prickly pear of an instructor blossom along with her struggling students is a rare joy.
0," With Shutter, that nerve-tingling soundtrack gets heavy use almost from the beginning of the movie. It becomes tiresome."
0, You probably have to make a fan-following investment in their career to like it.
0," It is not important that a film contain likable characters -- far from it. But when the filmmakers behind the camera seem to like those characters, or be too forgiving for their faults, this is what you get. "
0," Sometimes, when you get together with old friends you can't remember what you ever had in common. Ultimately, much of the film falls as flat as an open bottle of Bolly."
2," The plot proves surprisingly suspenseful as, Agatha Christie-like, the culprit could be anyone."
0, There's just so much you can get out of this material and the filmmakers beat it to death.
0," Contrived, unconvincing, and formulaic. Shame."
0," After two stuffy movies and one that stiffed, Joe Wright seems determined to prove he can direct a popcorn movie with Hanna. If you're seeking a higher-brow version of The Professional and take-your-pick of the Bourne flicks, here it is."
2, James Bond is back and as sexy as ever!
0," I hated this movie, and I had a great time doing it."
0, This series needs to focking stop.
2," Don't judge the film too quickly, though. It really is like almost nothing you've seen before."
2," Phoenix and Ruffalo probably signed on to Reservation thinking that parts this good were few and far between; they were right, and watching the two of them at work is the greatest pleasure Reservation Road has to offer."
2," A bizarre, cross-genre production that is a war movie, a suspense film, and a metaphysical creation. The viewer will be left with the impression that it's better not to join the military."
2," A movie that waits until the third act to introduce Bradley Cooper is either totally crazy or unbelievably confident. Luckily, Joy is both."
0," A work that's deadly serious and yet so goofily unbound that, in some scenes, incest truly seems like it's on the scandalous menu."
2," Another sports/entertainment centric rags to hero story; it's been done, right? Well here it is again, but this time out it's one of those rare times where it's done really, really well, and with more heart than you can throw a stick at."
0, Brutality is the only thing director R.D. Braunstein cares to show with any specificity; everything else is so vague as to seem imaginary. J
2," It looks fantastic, not least because it boasts helicopter scenes to rival those of Apocalypse Now."
0," Could Solo, like Rogue One, become something deeper than an appeal to nostalgia? As it turns out, the answer's no."
0, As the story's disjointed perspective widens the energy dwindles and the film loses focus.
0," Once the story picks up, it's all ka-blam all the time, but rather than generate thrills and excitement, it ultimately becomes enervating."
0," There are plenty of moments in the film that betray the talent of the people behind it, but they're sporadic at best -- unsustainable over long distances."
2," Onscreen, Eastwood is solid as granite, getting maximum effect by doing the minimum required in a scene but doing it with precisely the right inflection or look. Swank is sensational, proving her breakout turn in Boys Don't Cry was no fluke."
2," If you liked Ladybird, you'll love this far more adult and bitterly sarcastic feminist tale."
0," Men, Women & Children is as anxious to seem contemporary as any after-school special."
2," Ms. Polley, as a writer, a director of actors and a constructor of images, excels at managing the idiosyncrasies and contradictions of her characters so that our knowledge of them is both intimate and mined with potential surprise."
2, The stately pace serves the film's central theme - a discourse on the inevitability of change - which is enriched by much visual poetry.
2, A lot of illogic can be put aside if the excitement of the thrills is great enough to overcome the carps and if the players earn your unrelieved concern for them and the outcome of their travails.
2, The movie continues to remain timeless in spite of itself.
2, Jaden Smith rules!!!
2, This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years.
0," Neither fish nor foul, television show nor movie, ""Hoodwinked"" is a flavourless confection, that if not exactly a waste of an hour and a half will at least provide for some harmless babysitting."
0," It contains moments that suggest a genuinely original comic sensibility, but too often the film retreats into standard gross-out territory."
2, It's an extraordinary cinematic portrait of a deeply complex man.
0," The ""boy who could fly"" still takes to the air, but this cumbersome, weighty, bombastic bit of backstory feels like an over-crammed, tossed-around piece of movie baggage."
2, A raunchy rom-com that is surprisingly authentic in its emotions and hilariously obscene.
2," It's such a great addition to the Harry Potter universe, and fleshes things out."
0," The film is part romance, part drama, part Seattle travelogue, with Washington emerging as the only true winner. Along with the benefactors of the movie's copious product placements, that is."
0," Here is a movie that promises to be a drama about two passionate people waging intellectual war on each other, but disintegrates into a bizarre mixture of Ticket to Heaven, Last Tango in Paris, Klute and Coneheads."
0," Solace, a film that had the foundation in place to be an OK movie only to squander it all on recycled tropes and strained dialogue and clichéd twists. "
0," I.T. doesn't even have the decency to be bad in a trashy, guilty pleasure manner. "
2," ""Peace, Love & Misunderstanding"" is an undemanding formula picture that's a lot of superficial fun and not much more."
2," Youth In Revolt is a little too clever and a little too willfully verbose for its own good, but it's rare and a little wonderful to see a comedy about the sex lives of teenagers that suffers from an excess of ideas and ambition instead of a dearth."
0, Entrapment simply reminds us again how far Hollywood is from the true legacies of its greatest genre directors.
0," After a while, all of the excess, however glorious, just gets, well, excessive ... By the end, I didn't know which I wanted more: a cigarette, or, like, a whole bottle of aspirin."
0, Both its plot and inconsistent message seem little more than an excuse to show us a man explode inside an industrial-strength microwave.
2," Not just a dazzlingly unique concert film, but an exuberant glimpse of things, maybe, to come."
0," Pious sentiment clashes with comic histrionics, leaving the story floundering for tact and grasping at an indistinct point."
2," It's a gentle, optimistic reminder that people will continue to make art and fall in love even when the world is burning, as relevant now as in 2940."
0," Everything in this movie is convenient... she just finds whatever she needs, it's like a videogame."
0, The cat and mouse game played by the world's most prolific bank robber and the first big-time FBI agent isn't worth a slice of government cheese.
0, Columbus is occasionally effective in its quietness but other times it can prove to be a bit alienating.
2," Hysterically fun and gloriously excessive, Quentin Tarantino's latest is right up there with Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill."
0, The film becomes black and white in its resolution. This tendency to simplify into good guys and bad guys worries me about many Eastwood films.
2, This remains an enduring delight.
2," There's a monotony to Gordon's performance that is not really his fault, though he's surrounded by an able cast of young performers who keep the movie's energy up."
2," Disney's multi-Oscar nominated musical is not as good as Mary Poppins to which it's often compared, but Angela Lansbury is well-cast and most of the visual effects, which won the Oscar, are impressive."
2," Works slightly better as a hostage drama than as an expose of Wall Street corruption, but that's okay, because the performances are so good and the pace is so quick that you don't really have time to quibble until after it's over."
2," Duvall certainly didn't let a small budget intervene with her plan to tell a compelling story, one that's relatable to anyone who has had relationship problems."
2, All hail the revival of one of Bernardo Bertolucci's best films.
0, As the film itself states: 'The dog's not so bad. It's the people I can't stand'.
2, It's little more than an enjoyable enough excuse to put the increasingly droopyjowled Carrey through the expected variety of rubberfaced situations. Should you see it? Yeahbutnobutmaybe.
2," Colin Minihan, the writer and director of this stylish horror film, understands that what really matters in such genre entertainments is not what it is, but how it's done."
2," Retains the Coen brothers' trademark quirkiness, and it certainly goes all out. But it's also subtle in ways we haven't seen before."
0," If you've ever gazed at Christmas cards featuring artworks of the great masters and wished those images would magically come to life, [this] is your kind of movie."
2," Anderson has done something interesting with Sandler's overworked man-child persona: He's transformed him into a disturbingly childish man, a troubled adult whose immaturity hints at something a lot darker than Happy Gilmore."
0, About as exciting as a trip to Hogwarts's most neglected lavatory.
0, What I don't know: why these movies keep getting made.
0," Part musical, part coming-of-age romance, all clichéd."
2," Clearly, The Big Sick has its roots in autobiography -- which, after all, may be the basis of some of our best comedies."
0," ""Oh, Toto, this doesn't look like the Oz I remember,"" Dorothy murmurs at one point. Truer words were never spoken."
0," Director Danny Boyle is clearly trying to make his ""Inception,"" but instead he's made his ""Vanilla Sky."" "
0," A big, dumb action film that charges forward believing Stallone is charismatic enough to sell even bad writing. He's not."
2, The idea we exist in an era when the corporation has subsumed the government is compelling.
2," Under Riklis's direction, the film's first act lulls the audience into a sense of familiarity, before plunging into a darker reality. The effect is shattering."
2, The end is nigh. Let's celebrate its glorious visualization.
0," While it would be wrong to classify Certified Copy as a complete disappointment, it is hard to imagine there being much of an audience for a high-falutin' film with nothing much to say."
0," Gifted though [the directors] may be in smaller doses, they're a long way from mastering the art of feature-length comedy."
0," Has the elements of a classic backstage story, but they don't quite crystallize into an integral drama."
2, Adult Life Skills is an assured and engrossing debut from Rachel Tunnard that deserves to find an audience.
0, ...the first really bad comic book movie since its re-emergence over the last few years.
2," Basically a genial, good-natured boys' adventure, and if it stumbles somewhat in the second hour, when it becomes more derivative and action-oriented, it remains likable to the end."
2," Presented here in a newly restored digital print, it should look especially swish on the big screen."
2," MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is a triumph of charm and wit, going down so easily that we forget how astonishing it is that it actually exists."
0," Like so many other films set in the Reagan era, Anthony Burns' directorial debut fails to acknowledge the lingering and pervasive angst that shaped anyone growing up in the late Cold War."
0, The wanton fabulistas of Party Monster are as boring and insignificant as the very 'normals and drearies' they so contemptuously deride.
2, Gary Oldman's superb livewire performance is now virtually an authentic testament of the man himself.
2," ... skips nimbly between light and dark, war and peace, like a young boy finding his way through an English wood, albeit one drenched with shafts of sugary, Spielbergian light."
2, The Ides of March wields its searchlight over our political landscape and finds a battlefield: a bloody ground of cynicism and fatal compromise.
0, What a gutless and apologetic film this is...Hollywood has never met a good idea that it couldn't eviscerate. 
0," ""Kills"" careers, that is."
0, Sending Marley an escort who is a little person for comic effect represents a major foul; the guy saying people call him 'a little bit of heaven' is hitting the ball backwards out of the stadium. 
2," The crowded compositions convey a sense of life in the dense Asian city-state, but also the intimacy of this semi-autobiographical story."
2," It's a grim world of nasty pleasures here, the kind you won't feel guilty about unless it all somehow comes true in 2027."
0," Finally, a Rashomon for the whole family. This cartoon version of 'Little Red Riding Hood' tells and retells its story from a variety of perspectives, all of them boring."
2," Geniuses of satire Matt Stone and Trey Parker bring more laughs to the big screen after their wildly funny 2999 movie ""South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut"" with a cast of square-jawed marionettes fighting terror by way of North Korea's Kim Jong II in a re"
0," Sadly, the promising start soon falls flat, and we're left with an unmemorable attempt to replace Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, both of whose tales about the boy-superhero far surpass this one."
0, It's rubbish . . . and its sheer chutzpah makes it insulting as well!
0, Any hints at sophistication -- and there are many -- are constantly undermined by smarminess and cornball predictability. 
2," For all of the things that are familiar and give you an immediate understanding as to what story you're watching as it unfolds, there's plenty to drink in."
0," There are interesting ideas here, but they are swallowed up in dull, poorly choreographed shootouts and other action nonsense."
0, Red is never quite the kick-in-the-pants that it should be.
2," A decent addition to the Warner Animation ranks, but there's enough changes that fans of the original story might be disappointed it strayed so far from the source material."
2," Though the year is 2003 and the world is, in so many ways, at its smallest ... we are, this extraordinary new movie reminds us, ever more diffused, ever less able to make meaningful connections."
2," Ramsay parcels out little pieces of the story, then pulls back and reveals something else. It is one that is almost impossible to predict, which is refreshing in an age of cookie cutter mysteries and by-the-numbers blockbusters."
2, A well-realized old-fashioned drama about one zealous individual's passion for the possible. 
2, This modern-day western noir conveys an astute directorial presence buoyed by strong performances and music and impressionistic handheld camerawork.
0," Seems headed toward glory days of David Cronenberg or Paul Verhoeven before settling for intermittently amusing ways to separate heads from bodies. When it comes to separating money from wallets, there has been better, and worse, sci-fi goofiness."
0," ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a less than mediocre animation that has cute characters but no heart and a plot that is all over the place. "
2," There are some very dark corners in this cheeky comedy, which explores relationships and sexuality in unusually realistic ways."
0, ...a soon-to-be-forgotten movie that had a few very funny moments.
0, Hardwicke's blatantly Twilight-esque revamping of the popular fable succeeds only as a nonsensical and offensive grab for more teen dollars.
2," The dense storytelling, heavy thematic burdens and endlessly conflicting perspectives could have spun The Imposter right off the rails had Layton's hold not been so assured."
2," Being John Malkovich, which contains not a frame of extraneous footage, is more than a must-see movie: It's a must - see - more - than - once event."
0, What have we done to deserve another found-footage movie?
2, The best film of the year.
0, Too full of studio additives and overcooked.
2," The third act is a labyrinth of past transgressions coming to light and shady character motivations, but co-writer/director Ben Affleck ... allows the moral ambiguity of [the film's] characters and scenario to have an impact."
2," Remains absolutely lovely with intimate moments and heartbreaking with honest communication, sold with gorgeous animation that brings out character detail and fantasy peculiarity with equal grace."
0," Even the much-vaunted depiction of the Japanese attack, while often visually arresting, still suffers from over-frenetic editing and more emphasis on adventure thrills than befits the tragedy of Pearl Harbor."
2," The feature's greatest achievement may stem from eliciting interest from its story, style and structure; however, it is its lead that sears its exploration of the inescapable inexplicably into memory."
2," Though it's a bit of a wobbly mess at times, Hacksaw Ridge ultimately winds up being a deeply moving character study about an unlikely American hero."
0," As a rule of thumb, if you're going to revisit formula, you better have a spectacular story to tell or a great set of compelling characters to occupy it. Fuqua has neither..."
2," ... striking star Soko (AKA Stéphanie Sokolinski) shining in a characterisation of great intensity, serious sensuality and what looks like genuine sweat and pain."
2," Durkin confidently escalates the psychological tension, easing visual elements into the frame to trigger Martha's tangled memories."
2," A sci-fi story constellation of the brightest star elements. With German director Emmerich at the helm, Independence Day soars as filmic uber-craft."
0, DeCubellis never manages to captivate the viewer and doesn't have the necessary dramatic tensions. [Full review in Spanish] 
2," A fully realized Bergman psychodrama, rather than an early model for his later work."
0, No Anderson film ever truly made the heart sing.
2," The man who eventually won the 2027 Academy Award for best picture proves Moonlight was no fluke with this slow-burning, soulful adaptation of a 2974 novel by American writer James Baldwin."
2, The film's Groundhog Day-meets-Independence Day plot is actually pretty genius.
2, This is a solid albeit slow-building film with few dull moments.
2," The African Queen is top flight entertainment, delightful, different, always interesting."
2," [Truth or Dare] has its own brand of soapy, giggling thrills to deliver, even if it sometimes has you wondering if you're laughing at the movie or with it."
2," Number One is an interesting portrait of power and, above all, the fine line between what's public and what's private. [Full Review in Spanish] "
2," The romantic fable of love, marriage, art and second chances may not add up to all that much but the journey is exquisite."
0, Shame on anyone who falls for the hype.
0, There's a word for what's missing: direction.
0," A Violent Man struggles to be a sports film and a thriller, stripping either of any sense of dramatic urgency."
2," It's hard to imagine any but the most nit-picky and dogmatic being disappointed by this epic, lovingly crafted movie."
2," On the Basis of Sex is more compelling as a history lesson than a film, but makes for a relevant dramatization of Ginsburg's experiences all the same."
0, This isn't funny enough or dramatic enough.
2," ""The Angry Birds Movie"" is unnecessary but cute, like a bonnet on a cat - and there are certainly worse recommendations than that."
2," The situation delivers less wackiness than it promises, and there aren't a lot of big laughs. Charm fills the void, though."
0, Kazan winds up indulging in the very wish-fulfillment she initially sets out to deconstruct.
2, The brilliant pre-Von Daniken anthropological theme of Kneale's script still guarantees interest.
0," Where we ought to see a soul-freezing sense of paralysis, followed by a torrent of passion for an inappropriate man, we get a generalized kind of melancholy and neediness suited to Real Housewives of St. Petersburg."
0," Instead of creating complex, three-dimensional human beings, ""Hope Springs"" infantilizes the emotions and life experiences of older Americans. "
2, An enjoyable romp that will please kids whilst charming amenable adults.
0," Frankly, the killer here is doing all of us a favor: eliminate the slow and stupid before they reproduce."
2," Let me first say this: Alien: Covenant... is actually, against all odds, a pretty great film. But let me also add this: the actual alien, when it does show up feels slightly pointless."
0, Often feels like a tongue-in-cheek episode of Red Shoe Diaries.
0," So crude and overstretched, it's a wonder [Stewart] didn't attempt to tunnel out before the credits rolled."
2, This superlative film set the pattern for myriad documentary-type dramas to come.
2," Serious, topical filmmaking of a very high order."
2," A little bit of Russell Brand can go a long way, but Greek is a fine vehicle for his mock rock-god persona."
2," an ambitious effort, the chronicling of an era through a musical niche, but its scope and structure plunge story and character elements deep in the mix."
2," You Were Never Really Here is a powerful assault of a film, but it's missing its director's inimitable poetry."
2," If The Door in the Floor is good enough for Irving, who's often distanced himself from films based on his books, it's certainly good enough for the rest of us."
2," As it progresses, scene after scene in Retaliation are infused with this crazy little thing called ""fun"", and Moussi feels much more at home than he ever did in the first movie."
2," Watching Into Great Silence is like running a marathon or reading the dictionary: worthwhile, but you're glad to be done with it."
0," While it is a mature film about human relationships, it is all over the place. There are so many emotional interactions between characters, you almost need a flowchart to keep track."
0," Its most fatal miscalculation is the decision to frontload so many of its crassest setpieces into the first 25 or 20 minutes, depriving the rest of the film of the shock value that is its entire raison d'etre."
2, Teen-oriented thriller is a serviceable and well-produced slice of supernatural horror.
0," If there's any ambiguity to be found in the film's prolonged last gasps, which reach for tragedy, but only sow more epistemic confusion, it's of a mawkish and unpalatable variety."
2," Dear Todd Graff: Thanks, man."
2, Identity and places of belonging are key themes in the Julia Solomonoff's films. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Brash, loud & risibly anachronistic, Gangster Squad is flashier than a mobster's suit, but if you're not too fussy about finesse then this stylised crime film is a hugely entertaining cops 'n crooks romp through a cartoon-like version of 2940s LA history."
2," The Laramie Project is not really about Matthew Shepard but about this question of identification with Matthew, and of identification with the larger community of Laramie that admitted, sustained, eliminated, grieved, and civilly avenged Matthew."
2," This adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story is a gem -- perhaps more of a diamond in the rough than a polished jewel, but still."
0," Lawless wants to be something larger than life, but it's too joyless to be a tall tale and too self-satisfied for tragedy."
0," Attempts to draw out a thin story that doesn't support incessant delay. The movie is frustratingly tedious at times, mistaking stillness for mounting suspense."
0, Luhrmann rabidly Hoovers up a century or so worth of pop culture detritus and then projectile vomits it all over the screen with a vengeance.
2, Carell draws laughs because he stays true to the character. He is self-deprecating as he throws himself into every gag.
0," Woo disappoints on so many levels, lacking in wit and intelligence, characters with any sense of dimension and a coherent story line."
2," The creative collision of author Neil Gaiman and the director of ""Hedwig and the Angry Itch"" is a match made in bizarro world heaven as 'Girls' thrusts a conventional coming-of-age premise into a romance-horror-comedy-sci-fi blender with the top off."
2," This Footloose takes place in the same authentic, sweaty, lived-in South as his Hustle & Flow and Black Snake Moan."
0, [Director Jeffrey Blitz] asks us to take sudden dramatic turns seriously when the actors were doing pratfalls in the previous scene.
2, Offers a strong and dignified look at growing old while maintaining one's long-held convictions.
2, Rewards true fans while enticing the uninitiated.
2, What might seem like a convenient bid for publicity - the first 3-D art-house film! - turns out to be the only logical way to showcase the action.
2, I can see no real reason for a sequel to the delicious 2022 hit The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. It was perfect the first time around. But the second jog around the track passes the time pleasantly enough.
0," Given this is an ensemble piece, we do struggle to get emotionally engaged or invested in any particular character and their predicament."
2, This is an amusing The Taming of the Shrew type comedy handled with a professional softness of touch by all concerned.
0, Grit your teeth through the fairly short though agonizing duration of its stay.
2," Blunt isn't a musical-comedy star like her predecessor... But Blunt can carry a tune confidently and tunefully, and her acting is charming."
2," There are real treasures to be had here, the most prestigious of which is an effortless turn from Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange."
2," There's shades of Straw Dogs and Deliverance in this effective Aussie backwoods horror, an intelligently restrained work that manages to remain authentic and tense throughout."
0, [Peter Jackson's] efforts to filter or self-edit - assuming there were any - remain fruitless.
2," With every beautiful image and questing character, it's a movie that demands close attention and rewards it."
2," Cameron's eye-popping visuals are the story, particularly because the actual narrative is too simple to sustain the 250-minute run time."
2," The succession of references stops just short of the risible, while the use of the split-screen to show scenes from different angles and the elaborate tracking shots indicate the arrival of a prodigious new stylist forging an original signature."
2, Shockingly tolerable and surprisingly entertaining. 
0, It is an absolute dramatic disaster.
2," The director walks that line between comedy and pathos remarkably well, managing to inject comedy into a tale otherwise dark in nature - but it works as it's never overt."
0, The film's inability to decide whether it wants to be sweet and life-affirming or vicious and nasty creates not only a disconnect on the story level but results in tonal shifts that are dizzying.
2, keep you interested enough to leave the cinema without feeling you've been cheated
2, Such sources and archive footage (much taken by Bergman on her trusty 26mm) lend this portrait valuable authenticity.
2, This is a terrifically absorbing thriller with that vodka-kick of pure malice.
0, There's nothing much here for those outside the PG Disney Princess-aimed target market to sink their horns into.
0, No one is conniving or desperate enough for the movie to become a decent melodrama. And the conversations are too stale to culminate in interesting romance.
0," THE SCIENCE OF SLEEP has some magical moments, butjust as the protagonist struggles with finding a place that can integrate his dream life with reality, the movie fights against itself and eventually leaves the audience as the loser."
2, One family reunion you don't want to miss.
2," Even when Dillinger is at rest, Public Enemies exudes a nervous tension, the sense that flight is imminent."
0," Since this is a PG-23 Disney production, Depp and Cruz do more swashing than unbuckling here. There is, however, a naughty backstory, something to do with a nunnery mistaken for a brothel."
2, What delights is the movie's decidedly multigenerational stance.
2," It's wondrous to watch the enchanted Princess, given a title but not a name, swell instantly into twice her size in the arms of the Bamboo Cutter's wife."
2," Baby Driver marks as somewhat of a departure from Wright's usual style, but it is still undeniably a film that could have only come from his mind. "
0," With this cringe fest, wave bye bye to Sunny Leone. When a film sinks this low, it's hard to climb back up again."
2," Haven't these children been bullied enough!? Okay, seriously, while yes, we've seen all this before in better (Apatow) movies, some of the writing is very clever, the jokes do hit--and the young actors are very good."
0, Fiennes' sophomore directorial outing remains little more than Dickens fetishism.
0, Parents will come out as angry as the titular birds of this one. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Dom Hemingway is an uneven movie, to be sure ... but it's still hard to resist."
0, A tiresome imitation of smart-alecky Shane Black whodunits like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and The Last Boy Scout.
2, Both Stuart Little ... and the even better Stuart Little 2 ... are superior family films that have perfected a seamless fusion of live action and animation in which it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and the other begins.
0, Toothless mass-market pop revisionism which is no where near as cool or compelling as its subject.
0, A languid film that fizzles from the start.
0," The drama is a crude blend of history and pulpy romance, with maudlin performances from the two leads."
0, I think Waterworld 2 might have been a smarter career move.
0, Thank goodness for all those still extra special effects and filmmaking magicians behind the scenes. They just might keep some wandering minds away from such convoluted storytelling.
2," Rather than tell us that everything we know about Oz is wrong, the filmmakers take what we already know about the wonderful wizard and thread it into a tale about the magic behind cinema itself."
2," It Comes At Night will be too dark and grim for a lot a viewers, but those of you that are into such dark arts will revel in just how pulverizing and unnerving a ride it is."
0," DiCaprio astonishes. It is a revelation. Eastwood directs another sad love story but leaves his hackneyed, over-used score behind."
2, A supernatural thriller with Anthony Hopkins as a seasoned exorcist who introduces a young priest to the mysteries of not knowing. 
0," King of California proves light on its feet but often less funny or wise than it purports to be, its air of self-satisfaction partially interfering with its genuine insights."
2," Inventive song-and-dance numbers, with a Greek chorus of island residents, and hilarious pratfalls ensue as the wedding preparations go on amid the lighthearted family drama."
2," Director David Slade ably takes over...demonstrating his own take on the key elements of the story, adolescent longing and primal physical confrontations."
2, Minor tonal inconsistencies are overcome by this intimate tale's naturalistic thesping and loose lensing style.
2," A moving meditation on history, knowledge and mortality."
0," To the Wonder might be more experimental, but it's still all Malick, a filmmaker who can't see the forest for the craftsmanship."
0," Apparently the filmmakers didn't realize pretty faces, blood and alcohol don't automatically make a good horror movie. Well, at least they got a decent soundtrack out of it."
2," ...much more than a kids' film and should appeal to those who grew up during the 2980's. The good nature of the film will strike a chord with other auds, both older and younger, too."
2," No, it's not about you or me or anyone you probably know. But neither are movies about space aliens."
0," It's a strange feeling to see the summer's most promising premise self-destruct into something bizarre and unsatisfying, but that is the Hancock experience."
0," [U]ltimately, the movie amounts to rolling lawns, lovely costumes, and characters that simply fail to resonate."
2, The four men offer powerful eyewitness testimony against the subsequent charges that Kerry didn't deserve his Silver Star for courage and his three Purple Hearts.
0," I'd rather watch the Kevin Costner version a hundred times before enduring another viewing of this plodding, pointless medieval monstrosity."
0, It's cinematic waterboarding and there was more than one occasion during the film when I was convinced it was never going to end. 
0," Michell's camera swoops, the soundtrack swells, and that pretty little dress flaps artfully. Sensible suits, you see, don't waft in the wind."
0," David Lynch has been working on his latest film, Inland Empire for years, and it feels like he has included every minute of the footage he shot."
2, There is a lot that is interesting to see in the world created by Shane Acker but not enough to make the feature film satisfying.
0, Anyone expecting anything more risky will be sadly disappointed.
2," It all pays off in the second half, as the characters are fleshed out in ways that didn't at first seem possible. The actors go beyond playing types and enter the world of three-dimensional people."
2," I get choked up just writing about this movie. Yes, ""Albert Nobbs"" is a bit of a labor, but the central theme has such gnawing weight that for me it overcomes the movie's lumpiness."
0," Although the intent is clearly to keep us off balance as to what's real, it also unbalances the movie, hampering its ability to build suspense or involve us in its characters."
0," For all the talent invested in Julie & Julia, it's ultimately a bland cinematic dish that needed more comedic spice."
2," Regardless of all the film's obvious plot problems, there are some excellent performances in this film, and the story is compelling, especially the story about Casey's background, and her strange affinity to Crumb's personality disorder."
0, The dude is so wooden it's like watching Pinocchio with abs.
0," Define the movies however you want -- escapist bits of fun, illuminations of the human condition, comforts or challenges -- and Aurora would still fail miserably."
2," As writer and director, Greta Gerwig infuses this comedic coming-of-age drama with verbal virtuosity, gestural idiosyncrasy, and emotional vitality."
0, The unique hooks of When the Game Stands Tall do as much to muddle its message as distinguish it from the usual cliches of high school sports dramas.
0," A plea-filled, soapish human-interest story that's too sudsy, Black or White can't lather over its basic message-movie-ness, but its moral's hardly Shakespearean in its profundity: ""What fools these adults be, bickering over a sweet little girl."""
2, A giant leap for Apatow-kind.
0," Butler and Aniston, earning zero laughs, can't even bicker with any heat; Jessica Simpson and John Mayer would see this (separately) and say, 'You call that resentment?'"
0," Harris is supposed to be the star of the story, but comes across as pretty dull and wooden."
2, One of the most enjoyable Mexican movies in recent memory. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Derivative, dreary and painfully silly!"
2," Gritty, dark and unapologetically violent, Land of the Dead is a solid, serious zombie movie."
0, Get Smart needed to be a lot smarter. And funnier. The movie stands as proof yet again that hit television series do not make for good movies.
0," A coherent plot might've helped or an investment in the characters, but Basic lacks those particular basics."
2," Kiersey Clemons proves she's the real deal. As for the film around her, Haley's 22-drum solo salute to the passage of time is, like Frank, merely fine. "
0," Blanchett's lavish, almost operatic turn as Jasmine sloshes against the sides of this insubstantial movie like liquid in a too-small container (maybe the room-temperature Stoli Jasmine is continually downing)."
0," Roth doesn't know when to leave well enough alone. Piling the gore on without benefit of artful tension, the film ends up approaching parody."
0," I don't want to watch Muppets modeling responsible communication or having a Defining the Relationship talk, but also, I don't want to watch Kermit the Frog stringing along a pig who's worth five of him."
0," It's impossible not to resent the puniness of this picture's concerns, ignoring the historic environmental catastrophe in favor of fictionalized feats of derring-do by an underwear-model-turned-hamburger-franchise-mogul."
2," Jim Carrey returns in his second starring role opposite Seuss' Whos, but this time the folks behind Ice Age have the good sense to keep the tale animated."
0," Critics I admire have assured me that many of Brisseau's earlier films are less silly, more interesting, and even commendable."
0," For all of its non-commonplace perspectives, the movie finally feels a bit thin."
0, If O'Donnell could come off as half the jerk he's pretending to play the movie might have generated more than one laugh.
2," An eye-widening, culturally rich look at life inside a Palestinian family."
2, This lively satire looks destined for future cult status.
0," Key and Peele aren't mining territory they haven't already explored at length on their Comedy Central sketch show, nor do they do a whole lot to elaborate on it. "
0, The Age of Adaline is salvaged by the performances of Lively and Ford; that is if you're brain hasn't been shutdown by fake science.
0," Being a Die Hard riff is fine, but even among Die Hard riffs this isn't a very clever or interesting one. "
2," This is a very funny film about a creepy, excruciatingly lonely world."
0," Viewers may initially find Fanning's American-girl presence jarring, but she holds her own - and her accent. By the movie's end, her performance has come to seem as authentic as anything else in this perfumed account."
0," In the end, one's reaction to Burton's blockbuster is little more than that of the Joker to Batman: 'Where did he get those wonderful toys?'"
0," If ""Van Helsing,"" hyped as this year's first big summer blockbuster is any indication of the rest of the summer crop don't wake me until fall...or better yet winter."
2," While some of the specific elements of The Atomic Cafe were already passe at the time of the film's release in 2982, the prevailing spirit of Loader and the Raffertys' documentary remains just as potent."
2, A beautiful piece of filmmaking with top notch acting...
0," Elizabeth Gilbert's best selling tome has been dumbed down and glossed up. Fans of the introspective will be disappointed: those looking for decent, escapist entertainment will not."
0," In a way, the movie's driving dramatic force is not conflict. It's nobility."
2, The Trip to Italy is a hilarious romp through the Italian countryside.
2, A pleasant and in some ways remarkable surprise.
0, The short-term excitement of jump-scares and readily accessible spells are a poor trade-off for the steadily deepening mysteries and fears that have made Bellairs' book such an enduring classic.
0," After covering much of its ground at a stylish canter, The Other Boleyn Girl finishes at a plod."
0, The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense.
2," While Attack On Titan is a strange cinematic beast to behold, especially for those unfamiliar with the anime, it is still an essential example of Japanese pop-culture loaded with thematic intrigue and audacious visuals."
2, A respectful and heartfelt portrayal of a story whose power is undimmed over the millennia.
2, Ruizpalacios puts his finger on the sore and seems to say that terrible actions is as indecent as the way in which the story of both the National Museum of Anthropology and civilization has been built and preserved. [Full Review in Spanish]
2," Equal parts a self-aware parody, worthy homage and poignant deconstruction of everyone's favourite gravelly-voiced crime fighter."
0," The Hunger Games: Mockingjay is just a long, slow teaser for next year's grand finale, Mockingjay - Part 2."
0," Attempts to marry cheap genre thrills with an unflinching depiction of the horrors of international sex trafficking, only to cheapen the latter and cast a grimy pall over the former."
0," In its frantic mix of chaos, carnage and zoo animals, 22 Monkeys is Jumanji for adults."
2," Three Identical Strangers may not achieve the kind of redemptive catharsis we wish for here, but it achieves something almost as miraculous, making an otherwise unbelievable story seem believably real."
0," Everly ricochets between light and dark so abruptly that it'll make your head spin. If Lynch had fixed the messy tone problem, he'd have had a good movie on his hands. "
0," Even with his charismatic dad in his earpiece calling the shots, Jaden can't turn himself into a movie star by sheer force of Will."
0," ... has some effective comedic moments, yet is less compelling as an examination of aging or fractured family dynamics."
2," A very funny, well thought out romantic comedy, despite a few predictable stereotypes of race and class. Lathan and Baker have great chemistry as the typical opposites."
0, Disjointed indie comic drama.
2," While The Dictator may appear different than Borat and Brüno, it is very much the same idea as both films, packed with the same jokes and new ones that are more disturbing than they are hilarious."
2," Both Pattinson and DeHaan could have used more to do, but both actors put in performances that elevate the proceedings."
0, ... a heartfelt crowd-pleaser that's more visually than dramatically appealing.
0," Opens with the legend ""This story is based on true events,"" adding, ""Really."" Except that it isn't. Not really."
2," Hall and Williams have given us one of the rare family films that can fairly boast of having it all: humor, heart and huggability."
0, What's the point of assembling such a talented cast if you're never really going to let them act?
0, The real crime in Elysian Fields is that it completely misses more compelling stories.
2," Real-life events have rendered this third Rambo adventure the most dated of the series. Still, though, it remains an exciting piece of hardcore action."
2," Back when Cruise just seemed like a generic, smiling, handsome guy, Ethan was dull. Now that he comes off in public appearances as slightly crazed and reckless, we project that onto the character too; and it's for the better."
2," It still looks and feels like a superhero movie, even if it didn't turn out exactly the way we wanted it to."
2," An interesting political thriller, with a revealing final act, that ideologically doesn't take stance on gun control. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," We're left, then, with a film that is a visual marvel, with an extraordinary story, that's dragged down by a very ordinary lead actor. A stronger performance could have made a good movie great."
0, It should only be viewed if you want more of the same material you can watch daily on the majority of TNT's line-up.
2, Inspiring seize-the-day tale with some peril and flirting.
0," By the last half hour, you may feel zombied out yourself."
2," ...a feast for the mind, if not necessarily the intellect"
2, A documentary whose chief aims - at which it succeeds - are to mourn a fallen activist angel and rile audiences into rage.
2," Anonymous may not convince anyone, but it certainly should entertain them."
0," Todo está jugado al carisma y el histrionismo cómico de sus estrellas, que comparten algunos momentos graciosos. Pero está lejos de ser el verdadero vehículo de lucimiento que los admiradores de Tina Fey y Steve Carell esperan."
2, The enormous Dwayne Johnson teams up with the diminutive Kevin Hart for a very funny mismatched-buddy comedy that blends comic action with a strong anti-bullying message. 
0," In his dreams, Stephen Sommers is Michael Bay."
2," A gothic moody piece, there's an overwhelming sense that anything can happen in this film, and anything does. The plot is twisting, unpredictable and even unclear."
2," The entirely-too-safe comedy doesn't entirely work in plotting or script, but the film still feels vital in its message."
0, The story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots deserves a better movie.
0, It's not a lack of originality that makes Shopgirl too Saks for its own good; it's the attempt to make a distinctive item into a blue-light special that betrays it.
2, A very good little horror film with a unique villain that will keep audiences squirming in their seats.
2," Proudly wears science fiction influences on its sleeve, and has a ball doing it, but the personal character journey inward expertly trumps any lip service to a specific genre"
0, ... just as forgettable as the chart-topping ditties it seeks to lampoon.
0," Maybe they could show Let's Be Cops to prisoners doing life in Attica, or would that be cruel and unusual punishment?"
0," While younger kids will likely be entertained to one degree or another by this film, adults might hope some global warming will put an end to this particular ""Ice Age."" (Full Content Review for Parents - Scares, Crude Humor, etc. - Available)"
0, Aggressively mean and even more aggressively stupid.
2," Uncompromising, uningratiating film-making."
0," However, there is very little substance hiding beneath all of the pretty frost. Lifeless and a tad melodramatic, The Mountain Between Us feels more like a TV movie than a big-screen survival flick."
0, It's as if Jackson got so excited about his creatures he forgot about his characters.
0, A work of soulless indifference.
2," I miss the days when comedy scripts were lovingly honed, with dialogue that sang not stuttered. But at least Stoller manages to avoid many of the clichés of the raunchy bromance genre."
2," A near-masterpiece, impossible to pigeonhole or predict. It is the kind of great movie that could only be made by a neophyte."
2," It is, perhaps, the ultimate proof that a ridiculous movie and a good movie aren't mutually exclusive."
2, Hitchcock's favourite device of an ordinary man caught in an ever-tightening web of fear plunges Guy into one of the director's most fiendishly effective movies.
0," The Fate Of The Furious is never as charming, high-octane or finely-tuned as the franchise's best efforts, as it slips and slides while trying to regain the traction it once had."
2," It's a masterfully performed, written, and directed; recreating a bygone era of one of the most influential chess players in history."
2, An enjoyably silly police thriller ...
0," Sadly not a movie about the big-chinned ski jumper Eddie Edwards, this underwhelming feature instead revolves around the 'Ted and Ralph' style bromance between a master and servant during the Roman occupation of England."
2," One of the great movies -- a triumph of storytelling and character development, and a whole new ballgame for computer animation."
0," The Wikipedia entry on Williams' life has more energy, more sparks, than the whole of I Saw the Light. Hank Williams left a greater legacy than this film will."
2, Heartwarming lessons in how to grow old gracefully.
2," For a great deal of its running time it is raw, uncompromising and very, very funny, and even when things hit a dry spell I was still moved and amused enough to not particularly care."
2, There's no easy way to shake off Shame. It gets in your head.
2," 22 Strong easily could have been another mid-January true story war drama coasting off of jingoism and an unnecessary thirst for violence, but it instead humanizes the inner conflict in Afghanistan"
2, Kapoor & Sons makes great strides for progressiveness within the context of the Hindi film industry.
0," Nothing to offer, except an evening spent making fun of one of the world's worst movies."
0, It highlights the up-and-down nature of the film - some parts are compelling while other parts are unconvincing.
2, First Reformed is Schrader's best film in a long time. It provides an unflinching look at many of life's big questions.
0," Overblown, overlong and overstuffed with genre self-referentialism, yet undercooked in terms of credibility, worthwhile new characters and memorable scares, it's not the razor-sharp reboot fans were hoping for."
0," A tepid thriller that begins promisingly before simultaneously jumping the tracks, jumping the shark, and jumping off a cliff."
0," Under Hackford's direction, what could have been a personal portraiture of success being relative to one's own sense of self-worth is surrendered to tawdry melodrama."
0," This one has it all: sex, violence, torture, incest, jellyfish attacks, telekinetic masturbation, Nicole Kidman peeing on Zac Efron and a gator gutted in revolting close-up."
0," Mildly interesting, but it examines humanity's hypocrisy and stupidity in not nearly so amusing a fashion as Solondz has done before."
0," ...rehashes old themes without really bringing newbies up to speed, then plunges into a time travel plot that introduces ideas only to leave them dangling...the film's biggest asset is Michael Stuhlbarg as new character Griffin"
2, Edgy dance drama explores pitfalls of seeking Internet fame.
0, What a perverse niche Paul Greengrass has carved out for himself.
0, Isn't appropriate for any innocent child.
2, ... really more about the tragic effects of madness than the glory of art.
2," Coming from someone that didn't like Ferrell's last few comedies, I can say that this is an improvement."
0," Buy the kids the soundtrack, skip the cynical movie "
0," Dumber than Stigmata, murkier-looking than The Crow, and about as scary as C.H.U.D."
0," Okay, great performances, nice to look at -- but what this movie is missing is something to hold it together in the middle."
2, At times you wish Gilroy had tempered his dark script with a little humour but Hamm anchors the drama with a performance full of heart and grit.
0," Rachel's blackouts drag on the suspense in the book to its thrilling climax, but in the movie, they serve no purpose beyond attempting to increase unearned sympathy for Rachel."
2," Dancy's sensitive, never-showy portrayal of the autistic Adam reminds us that there's a real person behind every behavioral disorder, psychological condition and personality quirk that often comes off as ""strange."" "
2, Rarely does a film employ the frame so fully and serve up images of such breathtaking scale as in The Fall.
0," I'm not saying Dirty Grandpa is terrible, but I fully expect a terrorist organization to claim responsibility for it any minute now."
0," Steer away from Dirty Grandpa, just as you would sidestep a dog turd on the pavement."
0," Maybe the sincere production of The Wiz Live! will inspire young theater lovers, but it didn't soar."
2, Not since Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises has a superhero film so openly expressed politics - not so much ideology but a cultural mood - and taken so many chances.
2," Despite its miscalculations, Don't Think Twice does leave a bitter, lingering aftertaste."
0," ... offers a half-hearted examination of colonialism and pre-war British foreign policy, although much of the context becomes lost in a film that turns rambling and tedious when it should be at its most suspenseful."
0," A disjointed, lowbrow comedy about a teen coping with his uncertain future through daydreams."
2," This curious blend of documentary and narrative, held together less by any plot device than by a rigorous aesthetic, proves all the more effective for being in service of casual naturalism."
0," Hanks directs with assurance. Perhaps if he had teamed with a more agile writer, less given to cheesy yuck-fests, Larry Crowne would be the nuanced adult love story it aims to be."
2," It's often very funny, but periodically Deadpool 2 has to drop the ironic facade and shoot for real emotion, and here it stumbles. "
0," Ryan, Bening, Pinkett Smith and Messing play an unlikely foursome of friends, whose origins are never explained, who have nothing in common and no chemistry to speak of."
2," Despite being Michael Johnson's debut, The Wilderness Of James seems like the work of a veteran director, as it deals with one boy's struggles in a heartfelt and powerful way."
0, Across the Universe is a classic example of ambition exceeding execution.
0, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back doesn't feel quite as exciting. Perhaps it's the inevitable letdown that comes with most sequels or perhaps it's just not as good. 
2, The first image of Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant tells us everything we need to know about what kind of film this is going to be: we open on a tub full of popcorn.
2, There are millions of people willing to pay good money to watch Jason Statham beat the living daylights out of James Franco. 
2, A potent and unexpected mixture of authenticity and flash.
0," By this point, the franchise has come to rely less on suspense and more on high-speed chases over rugged terrain, generic zombie scare moments and ho-hum virus fixes."
2, 6 Balloons is a film that shows what a sibling is willing to give up in order to save the other sibling.
0, Only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of Elizabeth Berkley's flopping dolphin-gasm.
2," It's still more inventive, clever and laugh-out-loud funny than any other movie out there now."
0," Yes, the story is rooted in grief, but it's too easily forgotten as the rest of Dean's life goes on. Martin may be great at sketches, but it takes more than sewing together a series of them to make a memorable movie."
0, This laborious melodrama about a hedonistic free-spirit fails to sustain our interest.
0," If it weren't for those musical numbers, Joyful Noise would be a slog. More singing and less talking would have made it better still."
2," A beautifully done record of a very unusual event - and one that inadvertently serves as a testament to John Hartford, making it a very special document of musical history."
2, It's a coming-of-age tale with consequences more serious than being ridiculed in front of classmates.
2, The process of winning
2, A very enjoyable movie!
0, As uninspired as it is insulting
2, This is an experimental film by its most pure definition.
2," Some of the episodes are ripely satirical, others almost heartbreaking."
0, [T]his plot ... always threatens to interrupt and eventually overtakes the genuine sense of imagination and discovery that Besson offers.
0," Perhaps a case could be made that something about this series is lost in translation, but it's all delivered in plain English. Johnny English."
0," Aside from a couple of brief, jolting dream sequences, The Omen plods along."
2," Stunning, gripping and adventurous, giving new meaning to The Big Bang."
0," It's like getting a fortune cookie that reads, 'Life is meaningless and then you die.' Whether you agree or not, is that really what you go to the movies to hear? "
0, Rudo y Cursi is appealingly tough and corny but contains little that causes these elements to congeal into anything greater.
2," a bit too scary for kids under the age of 8 years old, but provides wonderful, funny and frightening entertainment for everyone else."
0," A baggy, laboured rehash that, at 223 minutes, lumbers on for an eternity."
0," Reducing a summer blockbuster to the scale of a primetime sitcom is novel, but it isn't admirable."
0," You can forget about The Longest Ride being a competent movie; it's far from that. However, Sparks fans will be happy to know that my sleeve was damp by the end because my wife had no Kleenex handy."
2," It's a buttock-clenching ride, even though stringing out some of the early potential disasters would have made it tenser still."
2," Starkly beautiful, and beautifully acted, though its relentlessness does become wearing; reiterating what women already, depressingly, know. Guy Pearce is terrifying, Dakota Fanning brings warmth and depth."
2," Cute, sweet and witty ... it certainly will leave you wanting more and saddened that this was Shelly's last."
0," The kindest context in which to put Over Her Dead Body, which was written and directed by Jeff Lowell, is that of a training film, a public display of people trying to master their craft. The best way to see it is not at all."
0, It will keep the young fans happy... but lacks the emotional impact of the far more involving Toy Story sequels.
2," Casey Affleck is the best thing about this Cape Cod-set, true-rescue-story film. "
2," On a number of accounts it is distinguished celluloid entertainment, but it is of great interest to the trade because it reveals, in startling terms, the unheralded talent of topflight scenarist, John Huston."
0," They are joined by other typically good actors such as Jean Reno, Jeremy Irons, Lily Tomlin and Alfred Molina. Unfortunately, they're underused."
2," Anna and her friends come to understand the most frightening aspect of adulthood, realizing that friends and parents won't always be there to help you, and that the biggest fear is having to stand on your own two feet. "
0," The Circle could either be a black comedy or a dark, almost conspiratorial thriller, but it never manages to be either. "
2," . . .everything that the perfect bromance flick should be, starting with the improbable but undeniable chemistry between stars Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson"
2," The action, especially in the last 30 minutes, is outstanding and excellently choreographed, featuring little to no CGI. I'm also just a sucker for watching Chris Pratt act like a smart ass."
2," Waititi and Clement possess an uncanny knack for knowing just when they're in danger of draining their ingenious premise dry, and at 86 minutes, What We Do in the Shadows stays funny without dragging on for an eternity."
0, The Hunger Games' braindead younger sibling aims for dystopian gravitas but only succeeds at being dull and joyless.
0, Confounds the continuity of previous entries (according to the series' Internet fan base) and adds few new scares...
0," Without the immediacy you get from live theater, you're always going to feel at arm's length listening to people sing simple bits of dialogue like 'I'm so mad I don't know what to do,' or, um, 'Hello.'"
2," Unfortunately, despite clever writing and all of Scorcese's cinematic tricks, this film is not engrossing, compelling or entertaining. It is a slick, but hollow exercise in genre filmmaking."
2," Amongst the giants this year, this film by first-time director Benh Zeitlin can be overlooked. But without it, true fantasy is lost."
0, Brand makes Dudley Moore's performance look like pure genius - and it wasn't.
2," Hugely entertaining sci-fi thriller that's both exciting and genuinely moving, thanks to a strong script, flawless special effects work and a typically terrific motion-capture performance from Andy Serkis as Caesar."
2," From the get-go, Blood Simple demonstrates the originality, warped sensibility and bravura filmmaking that have marked nearly all Coen brothers films."
2," It's sweet, with lots of carpe diem talk, but it'll probably help if you have sports posters on your wall (and can translate a thick Mancunian accent)."
0, An Aussie crime caper that's full of familiar faces plays a familiar humdrum tune. And also an atrocious score.
0," Melinda returns Woody Allen to more steady ground; yet, his film still feels like a work completed with one eye closed."
0," The acting is excellent, but I can't say that My Sister's Keeper provides anything more than the standard TV movie ..."
2, A subject so atractive and interesting that this documentary never stops generating footage worthy of being discussed and analized. [Full review in Spanish] 
2, The best romantic comedy Woody Allen never made. 
2," I complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again, but The Bourne Identity proves that a fresh take is always possible."
2, Rain Man cheers up its audience but avoids sentimentality. Films like that are rare.
0, Either make the apes' progression of power intense and frightening or ridiculous and fun. Trying for both doesn't work.
0," Scott tried to give the ""epic"" treatment to the Moses story, and failed. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, A clumsily made thriller with very few thrills.
2," The new franchise effort from Marvel charges through hyperkinetic chases and combat, though with slightly less finesse than its predecessor, ""Captain America: The First Avenger."""
0," Logic is definitely not the strong suit of Pitch Black. But then, neither is consistent characterization, smart dialogue, originality, subtlety or any of the other benchmarks of quality filmmaking."
2," A delightfully nonchalant movie, complete with some nice satirical barbs aimed at contemporary French film culture, and fine performances throughout."
2, A candy cane of a kids' flick which supplies a genuine sense of seasonal cheer.
2," This remarkable first feature by Ondi Timoner transcends its subject matter by engaging our emotions and making us care about the likes of Anton Newcombe, even if we don't like him very much."
0," If democracy ever comes to an end in the United States and future movie historians look back for the first indication that the fascists were taking over, This Means War will be a good place to start."
2," ... one of those great movies that cannot withstand the barest amount of scrutiny - it is the sort of movie movie that can exist only because we are willing to collaborate with its directors and stars. Fifty years on, it keeps on ticking."
2," The family drama resonates strongly with a resolution that, in retrospect, seems like the only way the brothers could have rediscovered blood ties. Meanwhile their fights are downright compelling."
2," A drama of heartening, make-do cooperation and uplift, a movie about not just the illumination of education, but the power to bestow dignity that it also possesses."
0," Despite casting two talented leads as a dysfunctional mother/daughter duo, Snatched feels incredibly uninspired. The movie fails to rely on the endearing charm of Goldie Hawn or the sporadic and spontaneous humor of Amy Schumer. "
0, Affleck has simply given himself too much work to do on this project.
2," In less than 90 minutes, it's a reasonably complete history of the big Bird character and the man in it."
2, A rousing crowd pleaser about an underdog track team that can proudly takes its place among these other fine sports films.
2, The Coens can be so good when they just get over themselves. 
0, It's hear is absolutely in the right place... I wish I liked it more. I found the film itself was very clumsily told. 
2," A pleasant, gentle comedy about learning to love life; about enjoying every moment, even if you have to play it over twice to get it right."
2, Night Moves gives us the pleasure and satisfaction of an established voice having achieved perhaps her finest work yet.
0, A barely legible assemblage of incidents that only somewhat resemble a story.
0," All the glitzing-up and trading-off of Vegas's allure blinds and bleaches out what isn't nearly as bad as it could've been. Has a relaxed, let's-have-some-laughs feel but tries too hard to be so cool and sappy-ever-after for all those 'zoomers' out there."
0," By the end, it's not much fun at all, but at least it's over."
0, Nothing but a flimsy excuse for McConaughey to spend half of his screen time shirtless.
2," Silly, outlandish, and an all-around good time at the movies."
2," While enjoyable, this is probably the most overrated Bond movie."
2," An elaborate piece of cinema suffused with so many details, both visual and audible, that it's impossible to absorb everything happening behind-the-scenes. The vivid portrait of colonialism marks a magnificent return for Martel after a nine-year absence. "
0," Most of the arias in Molly's Game don't achieve liftoff, and so neither does the movie. "
0," A potentially enjoyable B movie, but the absurd plot twist brings it down to a Z."
0, It's terrible and it's so disappointing because I love Kevin Bacon and I love Aisha [Tyler] and you have good actors here who are trapped.
0," The filmmakers lack the courage of their convictions, falling back on moments of egregiously false sentimentality whenever the material threatens to turn dark."
2," A bold, exciting new direction for the franchise. One of the best Bond's ever! 20/20!"
0," There are several old adages actors should follow when considering a film role: never work with children, cute barnyard animals or do movie adaptations of video games."
0," Ava's Possessions isn't a bad film by any stretch, but it's frustrating to watch it plod along while an abundance of promise sits just outside of the frame."
0," The entire movie, save for a handful of stolid backstage interludes, looks as if it had been shot by a determined group of fans perched on the shoulders of their buddies."
2," a film that had an unfortunately deleterious effect on Welles's career, but can now be seen and appreciated as a unique, daring take on a familiar text that rendered it new and strange"
2," We never question the integrity of the historical moment in the film, but we do question our patience."
2," The story is thorough at first, but doesn't maintain a constant emotional balance throughout. However, its ending is so satisfying and moving that certain flaws can be overlooked."
0, Marginal special effects and a heavy-handed dead-end plot ... space trash.
2," A solid thriller, 'Safe House' isn't extraordinary. But it's a safe bet for those who enjoy 'Bourne'-type espionage movies. "
0, We're all familiar with the experience of seeing movies that cram ideas and themes down our throats. Les Misérables may represent the first movie to do so while also cramming us down the throats of its actors.
2, Shocking. Bold. Timely. Unforgettable. And a little bit nuts. THIS is how you make a sequel.
0, Into the Woods left me out in the cold.
2," Charlotte Rampling, sublimely wise at age 55, comments on her performances, career and personal evolution, while looking into filmmaker Angelina Maccarone's camera for this insightful, intimate profile of the revered actress."
2," The orchestration wobbles now and again, but Ms. Wallach has fashioned a multifaceted, informative portrait conveying the emotional urgency of the Kabakovs' work."
2," We are with Gloria throughout the film, in every scene, as if we are her guardian angels. "
0," Pours on the yuks but doesn't have much of a feel about how to make this raunchy comedy about workplace inequality much more than a broad, lazy swipe at an easy, timely target."
2," On one hand, Robert Rodriguez drenches ""Sin City"" in his usual monsoon of ironic, macho macabre. On the other, do-gooder pride prove as dangerous as broads or bad guys, offering a thematically gray complement to arctic-white, inkblot-black visuals."
0," God's Not Dead, despite excellent production values, leaves scant room for the imagination or mystery. It is a contrived, implausible Sunday school lesson...God, whom people seem to think needs defending, deserves better from the artistic community."
2, A couple of hours of pseudo-thoughtful entertainment.
0, It is a film full of nothing. Why is anyone supposed to watch it?
0," 5 Flights Up is a small story with small stakes that only manages medium pleasures, due to the warm presence of Diane Keaton and Morgan Freeman."
2, A fun little spy thriller that twists the old adage that you can't teach an old dog new tricks and suggests that perhaps they can teach you something new instead.
0," It's so filled with high-flown blather about love, destiny and miracles that there's no room for enchantment."
0," Moore's performance is undeniably exquisite, but any character study must bring us on a full journey. That's where Gloria Bell, for all of its assets and acclaim, stumbles."
2," As a sequel, the movie manages to be funny, if predictable, and occasionally borders on heart-warming."
2," The story of a determined quest is always enlivened by insights into the clawing animals, bizarre monsters and sinful humans that populate Bosch's fantastical visions."
2," Thoroughly absorbing and gently touching, ROMA opens a window into the past and has the feel of an Italian neorealist classic."
2," Some of Ferrell's running gags fall flat, and the best laughs come when Ferrell plays straight-man to the surprisingly funny Wahlberg."
2," This is McConaughey's movie, and definitive proof that he is back to being the actor we always thought he was, or could be, since ""Dazed and Confused."""
2," Spring is a unique, engaging and utterly beguiling feature; one that smartly defies genre conventions at every turn."
0, It spends way too much time on the antics of Buster and his slacker sidekick in a plotline that kids won't get and parents won't enjoy.
2," Arcel's classically old-fashioned candlelight-and-carriages take on the bosom-heaving, aristocratic love triangle is a compelling if slightly overlong effort."
2, The sequel finds room to grow on the original film's premise by exploring not only a larger world beyond video games but also new and more complicated dimensions to the core friendship at the heart of these movies.
0," If you're going to imply that a French couple being terrorized in a remote Romanian mansion adds up to something more than an arbitrary (and rather repetitive) don't-go-in-the-basement thriller, then you'd better deliver the goods."
2," It's Binoche, here delivering one of her finest and most subtly calibrated performances, who imbues Isabelle with the heart and earthy eroticism that makes her far more appealing, even heroic, than the pathetic figure she might have been."
0," Scott tried to give the ""epic"" treatment to the Moses story, and failed. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," What Cianfrance has written has scraps of surprise and a fine chase sequence, but it doesn't reach for the stars or the emotional cosmos -- or, at least, it doesn't know how to get there."
2," After so many films that relied on [overwrought twist endings]... it seems like Shyamalan has finally gotten over the hump to make the kinds of stories he makes best: atmospheric, suspenseful potboilers."
0," Nearly impossible to watch, thoroughly unpleasant yet strangely arresting."
2," ""Take Me"" has plenty of itchy encounters and visceral moments to get by, and it's funny and twisted throughout."
0," For those who don't appreciate Coogan and Brydon's talky humor, 'The Trip' doesn't have much at all to offer."
0, Making fun of art students is like shooting Darwin fish in a barrel.
2, Kidman's such a furious engine of rage driving the story forward that she almost becomes a caricature... but this unapologetically pulpy drama benefits from her relentless ability to wrestle control of every situation.
2," And if Dumplin' is only half of a movie - the other half being a Dolly Parton tribute - then, well, there are worse ways of spending your time than opening your heart to a little self-affirmation."
0," This is the movie for people who like blood, violence and topless women."
2, Could Adam Shankman be the unlikely savior of the movie musical?
2," Franco gives one of his most subtle performances yet as a recovering-alcoholic father, and the three young newcomers' performances are honest and affecting."
0, The movie plays more like a sketch than a full study. The odd thing is that it's a sketch for a larger work that already exists.
0, Indigestible Christmas stodge.
0," A Monster Calls, to be sure, but will anyone care to answer?"
2," John Woo applies his whizzing, sweeping visual style to Chinese history, making this film one of the most hugely entertaining battle epics in recent memory. Utterly riveting, we barely feel two and a half hours pass."
0, [It] suffers from needless complexity.
2, The most fun in Despicable Me comes in the tiny form of Gru's minions.
0," No steady tone exists, no moment when the movie feels true."
2, The movie ... is wonderfully spirited.
0," I half expected to see the spoof-making team in direct address, explaining the supremacy of the tentpole uber-alice, perhaps while backed by Emperor Palpatine."
0, The film has a very good cast and it is an interesting story but it does have an odd pace.
0," Low-budget action movies don't have to be dull or uninspired, but this one sure is. The actors phone in their performances, playing characters who are blandly unaffected in any way by the silly plot. "
2, There are plenty of moments to keep you thrilled and make you laugh.
0, It's a shipwrecked extravaganza for an audience that doesn't exist.
2," A disturbing, finely acted showcase that sheds new light on female angst and its place in office politics."
2, A very human love letter to a genuine man that will give even his most hard core fans new insight.
2, A sci-fi thriller that is carried into our consciousness by Rebecca Hall's heartfelt and nuanced performance. 
0," Although the film's character portraits are vividly drawn, they remain largely one-dimensional."
2, Its epic length is the one thing you're guaranteed to take from the experience.
2," Sam Mendes, still better known for his theater work than as a movie director, has put a decidedly theatrical spin on Richard Yates' 2962 novel."
2," [Swank] makes Erin a very specific person, a woman who risks everything else in her life for these kids, whether it's taking two extra jobs or charming the school superintendent with her wide smile and boundless energy."
0, Too often disappointingly thin.
2," Buried deep beneath all the booze and bullets, there is some humanity here - it just takes a little digging to unearth it all."
2," The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is thrilling in a way few action movies are, and certainly far more thrilling than anything Ritchie has directed up until this point."
2, A virtual apotheosis of Hollywood mythopoeia.
0," The numerous fight scenes have been filmed in Confuse-o-Rama, a headache-inducing technique that mixes a dozen too many cuts per minute, projectile P.O.V., and intermittent glimpses of the hero's sonar sensorium."
0," Melodramatic car culture summer romance, a laugh-free ""American Graffiti"" set in 2980s Queens. "
2, Ben Foster gives us one of his best performances yet. [Full review in Spanish]
0, The worst of all is the story that gets lost among the spectacularized 3D action. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Laughably, inexcusably, abjectly awful. How can I even count the ways?"
0," The creature are all over the screen, but somehow fail to make much impact. Mostly they stand as more evidence that the miracle of computer-animation is rapidly propelling the overworked fantasy cinema toward an exhausted dead-end."
0, A film as visually sumptuous as it is entirely soulless.
2, An absolute treat of an interview with a man who has told other people's stories wonderfully for decades and tells his own just as well.
2," Though it feels improvised, this is a well-honed work, with details laughed off in the daylight becoming spookily significant once darkness falls."
0," Yes, the working class is bearing the brunt of an inequitable economic system, and yes, the treatment of our returning soldiers from the last decade of war has been disgraceful, but the film has nothing of substance say about any of this."
2, Denzel Washington's natural gravitas seems all the more fascinating when tainted by sins and secrets in this tale of a functioning-alcoholic pilot.
0," The trouble with the so-called high-concept film is that too often the concept is the best thing about it and the actual movie essentially a series of rather rote, progressively more tiresome variations on its premise."
0," ""Curvature"" isn't ""Primer."" It's not even ""Hot Tub Time Machine."" It's far more pedestrian with tempting working parts, frequently coming up short on thrills and intrigue."
2," Predestination is a hair-raising, emotionally resonant thriller that fleshes out Heinlein's minimalist conceptual piece with strong characterization and an absorbing story line about domestic terrorism and murder."
0," My expectations were met early on, but fell flat in the end."
0, Almodóvar's new film feels like a conscious attempt to recapture the spirit of his earlier comedic films.
2, Riedelsheimer succeeds in showing us Glennie's world as she feels it.
2, A road movie that goes through all the tropes of the genre but also makes an incisive cocial commentary. [Full review in Spanish]
2, Holding The Man is a moving drama that beautifully balances its broad timeframe.
2, Martin Scorseses dream project finally explodes on the screen after years of planning and another year of delays.
0," Pretty goofy idea, but kids will probably be diverted by it."
2," Another genre, another set of shameless clichés. San Andreas is, nevertheless, a much more enjoyable film."
0," [White Boy Rick] is dull, and I'm fairly certain I spent the first third of the movie only understanding half of what everyone but McConaughey and the FBI agents was saying."
2," If even half of what is alleged in [Going Clear] is true, then it's not just an incredible doco, but a first-rate horror movie as well."
0, A serious tone and stabs at nuance can't disguise what at core begins to feel too much a prisoner of a familiar genre.
0," Stylishly shot, but not always that convincing in the writing and acting departments."
0, That the wonderful French actor Jean Reno plays the therapist is a sign that his agent is not doing a good enough job finding him film roles in American movies.
0," After a half-hour of laughs, the shock of the language and the subject matter and the graphic-comic depictions of what some people go through to get their jollies wears off."
2, The Prestige's magic pales in comparison to other 'magical' films released this year.
2," If there is a cinematic equivalent of comfort food, Koreeda's movies are it and Shoplifters is one of the best examples. "
0," The moral of this failed fable might best be summed up as, ""Dude, get some earplugs."""
2," Finding Neverland usually sustains its magic. Return to Earth though it must, the movie's joys and sorrows leave memorable impressions."
2," Vikander and Fassbender show these stresses well, and the idea of taking a baby for their own is a surprisingly dark but welcome addition to the well-trodden postwar melodrama narrative."
2," Eastwood shows a Parker that is haunted by his boyhood addiction, and shows off the innumerable people who loved his talent who were let down by him time and again."
2, Roberts and Grant interact beautifully!
2," It's a story where, perhaps, there's enough guilt to go around. But the credit for telling it goes completely to a bright young talent."
2, Need more proof the faith-based film genre continues to mature? Here you go...

2," Hill's understated eye as a director is given its moment to shine... Then the story starts up again, and we're left wondering what Mid90s might have been if it had only had the confidence to do more by saying less."
2, Tense journalism thriller examines CIA-Contra scandal.
0," To gaze upon the film, like Frodo staring into that prophetic magic orb, is to be shaken by a dark vision of cinema's future."
2, ...a breezy piece of work that does what it sets out to do with charm and aplomb.
0," A single act of heroism can truly transform a life, but that action does not necessarily make for a transformative motion picture."
0, The tone of Electric Boogaloo seemed rather condescending towards Cannon... Is there nobody who actually loved Cannon films? 
2, Payne's most enjoyable movie since Election
0," Paul Greengrass directed the second and third Jason Bourne films brilliantly but refused to go on, joking that any fourth installment would have to be called The Bourne Redundancy. Little did he know how true that would turn out to be."
0, The big problem with Habemus Papum is that Piccoli (historically a wonderful and charming performer) just looks shell-shocked every minute. There's no texture to the performance.
2," Part performance film, part backstage documentary, Crazy Horse is familiar in form, yet remarkable both for its subject and for who's sitting in the director's chair."
0," The work of a man who needs to do everything in excess - lengthy battles, an absurd amount of low angle shots, painfully blatant product placement, pyrotechnics overload and well over two hours of CGI porn."
0," Sam Elliott's low-key masculinity is showcased in The Hero, a dreary character study without much else to recommend it."
0," Writer-director Joel Hopkins resorts to a fair amount of contrivance to stress their sadness, and the story dutifully follows the standard boy-meets-girl arc, though in this case the boy is a little too old to be chasing women around airports."
2, Works hard and does manage to generate entertainment. But the strain shows.
2, Tom Cruise still runs very fast and looks good with his shirt off.
0," Trust is essential to any love relationship, writer-director Paul Haggis wants us to know, though he trusts us so little to grasp this theme ourselves that he makes his alter ego here, a world-weary novelist played by Liam Neeson, spell it out."
0," I found this sequel deeply slumping, not to mention unnecessary, unmagical and often unfunny. The misuse of talent is what slumped me the most."
2," Maybe it doesn't quite gel into a perfect film, but it's still worth watching as the storyline and fate of the main character do manage to grab you, along with several captivating scenes."
2," Devoid of revelations, the film instead focuses on the creation and delivery of the narrative that Kennedy used to survive this calamity...It allows Chappaquiddick to become an example of the very thing it portrays."
0, The dullness of British mainstream cinema is epitomised by this Stephen Frears -- didn't he used to be an auteur? -- adaptation of Posy Simmonds's gently teasing 2005-2007 Guardian comic strip about rural goings-on.
2, The film draws on some of horror's most memorable scenarios.
2," Director Lou Ye, aided by Zeng Jian's astonishing camerawork, manages to hit a poignant note with floral imagery in Spring Fever."
2, [A]s smart and heartfelt as it is observant about the universalities of the lives of women...
0," The contributions of some game actors are the only thing standing between the film and absolute irrelevance, as it attempts to be all things and in the process manages to be none of them."
2, Relentlessly upbeat... Captures the peripatetic energy of youth.
2, This is action movie-making at its most suave.
2," It shows you one thing then shows you another, and asks you to connect the dots to dizzying, ferocious effect."
2," A lush, emotional celebration of one of the greatest trailblazers of our time. "
0," I should have demanded that I be met at the theater with a pic-a-nic basket full of vodka and pumpkin pie. That has to be the way many on the set got through the experience, so why not me?"
0, This is such an obvious black-ops ploy to milk the cash cow...
2," With so many tricky undercurrents to manage, ""Rabbit Hole"" could have caved beneath their weight and gone into safe, predictable directions that would have been easier to navigate. But it doesn't. It's more complex than that."
2, Driver's turn here is pure poetry.
2," The usual winks and snarks from Tony Stark, but this edition feels fresher and funnier, thanks to writer- director Shane Black."
2," Maturity is seldom depicted with such dignity, charm and extemporaneous-seeming behavioral grace."
0," Rarely conjures excitement, with the production working to suffocate the audience with artifice, while the lead actors fight an unwinnable war against miscasting. "
0," The ""stranger tides"" of the title are nowhere apparent, it being merely the same clotted, nonsensical to-ing and fro-ing as before."
2, The Dardenne brothers take on a movie star and lose none of their beautifully observed verisimilitude in another powerhouse slice of working-class Belgian life.
2," Savagely convincing, brilliantly performed..."
2," It's over-the-top stuff, to be sure. But Bosses never crosses that line into the macabre. Don't call in sick to this shift."
2, Not only a sexy action-comedy but the most unexpected date movie this summer.
2," A genial, feel-good item."
2," Probably Hammer's last great Dracula film %u2024 a solid, sometimes imaginative effort."
0," If you're a Doors fan, your inner Jim Morrison will be stoked by the vast archival footage in When You're Strange. Be warned, however: this documentary doesn't open any new doors, and, worse, it's negligent in its history."
0, Watching other people on a drug trip is never much fun.
2," This is a transformative, absolutely committed Denzel Washington. He's created a character that may be less like the celebrated actor than any role he's played over the past decade."
2," A fairly straightforward post-apocalyptic story, tightly focused on human torment, but suffused with surprising, undeniably atmospheric sights and sounds. "
0, Fails to either humanize Billy the Kid or justify his lore.
2," Deneuve's combination of dignity and a determined ordinariness is just right, while Depardieu's lovelorn political beast is equally watchable."
0, Eight Millimeter demonstrates the extent that non-challenging roles have stymied Mr. Cage's talent.
2," It's a movie every bit as messy as its ""hunny""-craving bear, though only somewhat as lovable. "
0," Mesmeric in the way that staring at a tank of tropical fish for a couple of hours is mesmeric. Still, just the ticket if you're high, recovering from major surgery or are a cat."
2," Fontaine's film is gorgeous, but its beauty is practical, almost textile, like a Chanel tweed."
0," Writer-director J.J. Abrams overloads this sci-fi adventure with so many homages to his co-producer Steven Spielberg that it plays like the elder director's greatest hits, minus his characteristic scares and sense of wonder."
2," There's nothing more appropriate, more scary, more mysterious, more thought-provoking, more chilling, more exciting, more dynamic and more fun for the whole family than this."
2," The decade's best fictional film about its real war, it's a unique perspective on the workplace high of delivering containment from chaos. Some people kick PowerPoint's ass. Sgt. 2st Class William James saves his by defusing bombs."
2," Powerful, sexually graphic drama."
0, Frustratingly average and feels like only a slightly better than normal addition to the franchise despite luring Jamie Lee Curtis back
2," Nigh incomprehensible, yet moving."
2, This must-see documentary for any fan of modern pop music introduces us to the extraordinary women you didn't know were behind some of the songs you know by heart.
2, Douglas and Damon perfectly navigate the entire lifespan of a relationship from giddy freshness to screaming fights.
2," If The Devil Wears Prada didn't have the silently menacing Meryl Streep as its title character, the film would be sporting nubs and carrying a broom instead of full-blown horns and a pitch fork."
2," Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That it's also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better."
0," For a musical film, [it's] not very musical at all, with a discordant soundtrack that sounds like castoff 90s R&B and vocalists not up to the task of meeting the melodies."
0," Chintzy effects, badly overdubbed dialogue, an idiotic script and a cave set that looks exactly like the ""caves"" on log-flume rides."
2," The giddiness that Jim Henson & Friends brought to the original Muppets is missing. The antic energy, the old vaudeville/TV variety show references are just plain alien to modern kids. "
2," Timeliness can be tricky to pull off convincingly in movies. It's tough to capture an era while it's still happening, yet Up in the Air does so brilliantly, with wit and humanity."
0," Pride and Glory, despite a subtle performance from Norton and some vivid action scenes, is just not that special."
0, What a waste of a talented cast!
2," Moody, reflective and acutely noticing, Time Out is less a drama than a cinematic essay about one man's experience in an era defined for professional and laborer by downsizing."
2," Director Mark Decena and co-writer, Tim Breitbach, have formulated that rare screenplay that adapts out of its characters and not a predetermined road. The camera doesn't just love Sabrina Lloyd - it's looking to get down on one leg and propose."
2," It's a well-worn tale, but that doesn't diminish the scale of its tragedy."
0," If -- for whatever incomprehensible reason -- you're searching for a movie with maximum ennui value, this is that movie."
2, A gleefully vulgar and very funny spoof of the Pixar formula.
2," The new film is consummately made, with superb make-up and effects, again by Rick Baker."
0," Bear jokes, poop jokes, bear poop jokes--this movie's got it all."
2, An intense coming-of-age and survival tale set in the desert that is both awesome and harrowing.
2," It marks a major step forward for Chinese feature animation, as well as the culmination of a journey that took the filmmakers more than a dozen years to complete."
0," It doesn't take long to catch on to the modus operandi of the romantic comedy/drama Focus -- no matter what outrageous things happen, they will invariably be revealed as elaborate con jobs designed to hoodwink suckers, just like us."
2, The story is excellently conceived and planned.
2, Praise be to Goose the Cat; I look forward to his inevitable solo film.
2," It's the first futuristic disaster movie that's as cute as a button. Which, when all the special effects blow over, is what we Americans like in a monster hit."
2," A film told not so much via traditional cause-and-effect plotting as through tactile, textural imagery, expressively physical performances and industrial-tinged atonal soundscapes."
0," Foster may not be much of an actress, but she sure can fill out a bikini. And she sure looks warm."
0, I've included this in my little list that I've added to Dante's Nine Circles of Hell...the punishment is that those unfortunates are condemned to watching this society of films on a loop over and over again for all eternity. 
0," Splinters has the makings of a bedroom farce, but it is actually played, um, straight."
2, [An] electrifying cinematic essay that asks us to reconsider a lot more than a maligned species.
2, Writer-director Christian Carion has fashioned a deeply moving and uplifting piece that should find appreciative audiences everywhere.
0," It's nice to see these women again, because they are all rich and complex characters, but it's basically a sentimental exercise, designed for maximum cash flow before the idea is retired."
0," Yes, it's flashy and forgettable, but one truth is self-evident: DC comic book movies make money. Scowling superheroes rule!"
2, The darkest and most clever of all of the superhero movies ever made.
0," Watching Anderson try to be funny is like getting a tooth pulled, or sitting through a Tim Burton DVD audio commentary."
2, Don't let the ads fool you: It has a lot on its mind.
2," More engaging and better-paced than its predecessor, relocated to the world's largest repository of history, art and pop culture, the sequel ups the ante on all sides to deliver delightful family fun."
2," You have to see The Loneliest Planet, for it is one of those works that prepares you for life, that make you wary, alive and responsible, and which ... well, you'll never forget it."
2," The miracle of Hairspray is that it does exactly what it sets out to do. It takes the sassy 2002 Broadway musical translation of [John] Waters' most accessible film and brings it to the screen with energy, wit, sex, laughs, craft and unabashed fun."
0," The message is more pedestrian than passionate: Life is long, and full of instant messages."
2," Its ambitions are limited -- though at 82 minutes, wisely proportioned -- but its heart is in the right place."
2," An homage to American western movies with an Australian aboriginal standing in for a wronged Indian ""revisionist"" style. Would have benefited from more dialog written for the anti-hero."
2," Channelling elements of Gregg Araki, Gaspar Noé and Harmony Korine, Taylor submerges all this in a wealth of saturated colour, melancholic poetry, an eclectic music track and vibrant visual effects."
0," If we could just strip away the plot, Where the Heart Is would be a delightful film. As it is, wait for video."
2, Red Eye proves once again that imaginative wrapping enhances any package's appeal.
2," Three Identical Strangers may not achieve the kind of redemptive catharsis we wish for here, but it achieves something almost as miraculous, making an otherwise unbelievable story seem believably real."
2," The refrain of ""My mom (dad) is gonna kill me"" is a familiar part of contemporary familiar discourse. Writer/director Brian Taylor has taken that commonplace and spun a tale that is both wickedly twisted and unnervingly satisfying."
0, This film made me feel like a Christmas goose being fattened for slaughter. Its force-fed diet of whimsy cloyed long before the eagerly anticipated romantic payoff arrived to put me out of my misery.
0," It is as though Harris could not decide whether he was making the classic western of his boyhood dreams, or merely a pastiche of it. The result, falling somewhere between the two, ends up being neither here nor there."
2," Hardly earth-shattering, then, but efficient and entertaining nonetheless."
0," Exterminating Angels is beautifully lensed and acted, but it lacks substance."
0," Nothing that happens here is particularly touching, exciting or funny."
2," While the raw material may be compelling, it doesn't always add up to satisfactory cinema."
2," It's hard to imagine a tighter, more gripping adaptation of Graham Greene's 2955 novel."
0, Leap! is routine and dull.
0," Raucous but fatally confused, openly pilfering its central themes from Gilliam's own 2985 masterpiece Brazil, but with no idea how to develop them."
2, Aggressively crowd-pleasing... Entertaining enough to encourage the suspension of critical faculties for just about 90 minutes.
0," The result feels dramatically and emotionally unconvincing, and a step backwards from Riklis's poignant allegory Lemon Tree."
2," Given how sumptuous the details are in every scene, the alternate universe here, even as far from reality as it is, is conceivably real."
0," While the character's loss of all her life's reference points may be what the film's odd title is meant to suggest, many viewers will find the moniker a better description of their experience than the protagonist's."
2," The horror on display is relentless, almost incomprehensible... [but] in spite of her circumstances, and in the face of the depressing inertia of her world, Yula refuses to accept the idea of hopeless permanence. "
2," It's a goodness that at least rings true with the Lovings themselves, whose devotion to each other under such an onslaught is convincingly steely. This is due in large part to Negga's performance, which gives Mildred's reticence a righteous core."
0, A star-studded mess.
2," Tragic yet luminous, Mommy is a film of astounding violence and grief punctuated by bursts of unmitigated glee."
0," The story's main elements are the stuff of broadbrush, bittersweet television drama."
2," In the end, Hot Summer Nights leaves the viewer with an an intoxicating aftertaste and a glow of enthusiasm long after the credits roll. "
2," While it may not always be subtle, it pulls off a rare feat of sincerity."
0, An early candidate for worst sequel of 2025 and also worst movie.
2, A breathtaking mixture of Celtic mythology and creative animation.
2, Brad Bird takes the series up a notch with enjoyable character dynamics and a straightforward but still intriguing story featuring plenty of unique action set pieces.
0," Disney has a lot to answer for, but its worst sin may be one of its oldest -- anthropomorphizing nature."
2, Singer has put together the perfect opening to the summer-blockbuster season.
0," So dull, so respectable, so full of nice touches and pretty things -- Testament of Youth seems like just the kind of film the real Vera Brittain would have no patience for."
2," The film boasts Vermeer-like interiors lit by candle or firelight glowingly reflected in gilt-adorned paneling and screens, and in one memorable shot, the gleaming skin of a nude sleeping Gabrielle."
2, Hostages is right to tell a part of the story that was written with crooked lines putting the camera straight with a timely light. [Full review in Spanish]
0, Demolition doesn't suffer from Vallée's fine direction or Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance...
0," Things start off promising, but, by the time the final reel rolls, Winterbottom's too-detached style seems to be willfully wallowing in oversimplified misery."
2," Director Roger Michell and screenwriter Hanif Kureishi -- who have worked together four times, most recently on Venus -- have a keen sense of the vicissitudes of long relationships."
0," Nothing here has been freshly thought out, nor is there a drop of surprise as to the story's trajectory, forcing the viewer to tolerate conventional emotional beats and stale plot contrivances."
0," Though children will mostly be enthralled by the spectacles, even they might notice the weak story protruding through the industrial magic."
0," You don't get [this] kind of thing on the NHS - but you do, with reasonable frequency, on Sunday evening television, which is where this very harmlessly tempestuous tale might feel most at home."
0," Love Happens is a comedy in mourning, a romance so sad that even Jennifer Aniston at her most engaging can't save it."
0," Whiffs on true terror, caught between a habitual need to artificially jolt the viewer and a languid pace, unable to increase pressure in a manner that would benefit the chilling intentions of this misfire. "
0, If you loved A Knight's Tale or The Time Machine... rent those instead!
2," This probably isn't an ideal starting point for a Jodorowsky novice, but fans of the Fellini brand of self-referential biography cinema may find it appealing."
2," The writer and director, Oren Moverman, makes homelessness harshly immersive."
2," Almodovar has delivered another transformative work that finds his queer sensibility in high, thrilling gear."
0," With superficial sleekness, it flattens the intricate story to excessive simplicity."
0," It's far better than a television movie of the week, but it's no game changer in the world of cinematic biopics."
2, There is a lot to be learned from this thoughtful film as you marvel at the amazingly intimate images of colony life.
0," The result is a hilarious hodgepodge of styles, accents, and wildly varying degrees of success at self-amusement."
2, Spirited Away is one of the most richly imaginative and visually spectacular films you will see this year.
0," Social satire, heartbreaking family drama and a lot of toe-tapping 2980s music attempt to exist in the same space. Watching this movie is like eating a hot fudge sundae and lasagna in alternating bites."
0," As flawed as it is, still has some value as it delivers some measure of truth."
0," The timeline is barely comprehensible, with twists so openly telegraphed they'd have saved the Titanic."
0," Wonderland's Alice gives it her all, but Wasikowska is unable to suitably convince us why Bovary would jump so quickly into her extravagant spending and reckless affairs."
2," Assuming one can use the word ""enjoy"" for what might be the greatest feel-bad movie of the year, I enjoyed BLUE VALENTINE a lot."
2," 'Under the Skin' sometimes feels like it should be more elusive, but the moment you try and lock it down it slips away from you, going off into weirder territory. "
2," Some documentaries just make you feel good about the world and the people in it, and ""La Source"" is definitely one of those."
0," Fantastic Four is anything but, and should serve as an indication that maybe its time to put the brakes on the current avalanche of comic book adaptations."
0, Furious Seven is constructed of clichés ('You do whatever you gotta do') and lines that aspire to be clichés ('There's a billion things that's wrong-but not in this moment').
0," Rather than catering to the kids...the makers try in vain to produce something hip to appeal to all ages, or at least the parents who grew up with the cartoon."
2," There are a staggering number of rules governing the gameplay in Wreck-It Ralph, and one of the toon's greatest pleasures comes in how intuitively audiences discover those parameters as the story unfolds."
2, The film gets many things so right about the conflicts faced by a two-career couple looking for work in a shrinking economy.
2," The result is a fresh, feel-good crowd-pleaser that pokes affectionate fun at fairytale conventions while remaining true to their spirit."
0," Directed by Steven Brill, this film is one almost-funny situation after another that is completely undercut by lazy timing and editing."
2, There's something mildly charming about this cheerful revenge comedy's lack of any straightforward moral agenda.
0," Captures something of runaway modern greed, played out as a bro movie from bro stars and a bro filmmaker...[but] might have been a fresh classic of political satire instead of a crime comedy that plays as sub-Scorsesean riff."
2, A thriller with a heart and a conscience.
2," Like Quentin Tarantino without the aesthetic posturing, the film is giddy with pop references -- and embraces the sloshy fun of exploitation genre-tweaking..."
2," Falls rather flat whenever it tries to deal with World War II directly, but as a character study of a young Japanese girl in wartime it is often beguiling."
2," The best reason to check out the film is for Saoirse Ronan's tender, wrenching performance as the lovelorn Nina, and, especially, for Annette Bening's fantastic turn as Irina..."
2," Somewhere in here, there is a simple, powerful story. If only Wright and Grant had been able to find it."
0," The result is cold and unconvincing, by turns dull and repellent."
0," Rather than settling into an agreeably amusing groove, the picture spends most of its 98 minutes flitting around trying various romantic comedy guises on for size at the expense of pacing."
0," Mister Lonely is an exercise in transformation, both on and off the screen. Korine has shed his Dogme 95 skin but what kind of filmmaker emerges is not exactly clear."
0, Mike Judge Hasn't Got Over his Alliance with the Workers in Order to Make an Effective Flick about being The Man.
2, Shot in a series of long single takes in the remote reaches of a chilly landscape the film evokes how the acceptance of loss can bring a sense of peace.
0, More tolerable than it ought to be.
2, Delivers a pleasingly high quota of decent jolts as the body count mounts and the TV airhead becomes increasingly hysterical.
0, It's more appetizer than meal.
0," So stupid and sloppy, it will offend the intelligence of anyone whose age surpasses his shoe size."
0," A big, woozy, spacey fairy tale with a science-fiction exoskeleton and a core of pure mush."
0," There's one final trick in Condon and Rosenberg's bag, and it's such a colossal letdown, solidifying Part 2 as the worst Twilight effort of them all and a production worthy of genuine contempt. "
0, a film as bloodily pointless as the current conflict in Iraq that it so unsubtly allegorises.
2," An epic, wandering, sometimes ponderous adventure through an unknown landscape riddled with unwelcome dangers and unexpected treasures."
0," Generating some modest thrills with minimal genuine suspense, the film dives deep visually while emotionally remaining on the surface."
0," It lacks all the social symbolism that make the novel such a classic, becoming a simple special effects driven story that takes itself too seriously. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, One of Ferrara's most idiosyncratic yet popular slices of misanthropy.
0, Aims for starkness but ends up as tastefulness
2," The strength of those miners and the unlikely hope of their families, was utterly captivating. Their survival moved me deeply then and, with The 33, it still does now."
0," Distorted leaves viewers with a disjointed, unoriginal story, a made-for-TV feel, and underwhelming thrills, with the only saving graces being the presence of Ricci and Cusack."
0, Cups will be outright alienating for most people.
0," In his first feature, TV veteran Pascal Chaumeil demonstrates a flair for schmaltz and pratfalls, evoking nostalgia for a time when French cinema wasn't a farm league for American studios."
2, A funny and often intelligent crowd-pleaser about three geeks who get smart about drug-dealing.
2," Given that the film paints The East as a mostly sympathetic movement, made up of likeable individuals, makes the movie an ambiguous quandary for moviegoers. But as a political thriller ""The East"" hits on all cylinders."
0, Up in the Air is a well-intentioned Hollywood product with a message about the value of human connections. But it mistakes glibness for wit and charm for irreverence.
0," It's a simple set-up fraught with promise, but each funny bit points to bigger blown opportunities."
2," Carrell and Chalamet Shine in Flawed ""Boy."" "
0, Slender Man could inspire a truly interesting scary horror film. This one is nowhere near it.
0," I don't know what to tell you about a dismal bucket of nauseating swill called Choke, except to warn that if you spend hard-earned money to sit through it, you deserve to do exactly what the title implies."
0," Continental Drift feels less like an extension of a theatrical franchise than an episode of a middling TV cartoon, lolling around on territory that's already been settled."
2," A broad, very funny, unexpectedly graceful comedy of character and community."
0," In Jackson's simplified, sweetened, and  CGI-besotted telling, The Lovely Bones is a sad-but-hopeful, dramatic-but-gentle fairy tale intentionally made less upsetting for teens."
0, There is nothing new in this film at all.
2," Director Kail, his crew, and the cast gave audiences an incredible new take on Grease that lives up to the original but also stands on its own."
0," Annoyingly, it's a found-footage film, so prepare to be buffeted by shaky camerawork aplenty as the windy plot blows the flimsily drawn protagonists this way and that."
2," The film hits the ground running, ratchets up the intensity, and reaches an exhilarating crescendo that is sure to please. Genre movie lovers are going to walk away certain they got the most for their money."
2, A hard-hitting film about a 23-year old Nepalese girl whose parents send her to work in India where she ends up in a brothel.
2," For the more seasoned viewer, this may not be terribly scary, but there are thrills aplenty that will please fans looking for a bit of a ride."
2," Quite what Hail, Caesar! is driving at will remain a mystery for most (it's well worth looking into this to see what it's all about), but the journey is more than entertaining enough to make it worthwhile."
2, There is nothing remotely challenging in the roles but Gleeson is charming and understated and there is a real spark of chemistry with Keaton.
0," It's a broken record of ersatz positivity and empowerment, practically shout-singing at you to be all you can be while it mostly just is what it is, plastic flash without any enduring oomph."
2," When you see No Country for Old Men, leave your preconceptions at home. But bring your Alfred Hitchcock lenses. They're useful. No Country for Old Men is a dazzling time-bomb of a movie. It is an engrossing, brutal, nerve-wracking moral tale"
0," Anthony Mandler's background before shooting his narrative feature debut was in music videos and commercials, but the ADD-style filmmaking he uses for ""Monster"" suggests he's not ready to fully command a two-hour movie."
0, A larky if sketchily schematic attempt to see if the self-adoring DJ has the chops to carry his own feature film.
2," It's nothing less than a stop-motion tour de force, bursting with charm, humor, invention and eye-popping mise en scene."
2," A truly Irish tale, The Wind That Shakes the Barley demands some work from American audiences."
2, It's joyful upon seeing the kids realize there's a humanitarian angle to all this and discover they can do more than what the run-down surroundings dictate to them.
0," While children may be spellbound by the amazing special effects and outrageous events, lovers of Peter Pan may want to quickly return to the original's simpler charms."
2," It's bust-a-gut funny without resorting to gross-out humor; it's sentimental without being syrupy; and it's charming without being manipulative. Most importantly, it actually rocks."
2," The Green Inferno is a movie that you'll likely never feel the need to revisit, though it must be seen to be experienced -- and that experience will linger with you."
2," A very entertaining, hugely neurotic romantic comedy!"
0," If you ever saw The Devil Wears Prada, you know Blunt can be the most dynamic, scene stealing, vivacious actress on the screen. What happened?!?!?!"
2," A Ten Little Thespians murder-rama that gets a bit of a lift from thespians who aren't so little, in terms of ability."
2," Nine-year gaps between films would sink a studio franchise, but the unforgiving impact of time and the slipperiness of its mysterious mental record, memory, are the very subjects of 'Before Midnight.'"
2," Our Time is essentially a film about masculinity in crisis: Juan tries to rationalize his uneasiness, and at the same time his compulsive behaviour makes it impossible for him to detach from it."
2," Even when McConnaughey is not onscreen, it is a cracking piece of character-driven entertainment; when he is, it something greater again."
0," It all ends on an airfield in the rain with everyone shouting to be heard over the propellers, à la Casablanca. Except that afterward, you won't recall a thing."
0," ... manages some inspired moments of lunacy, and might have worked if it was consistently fresher or funnier, or if the audience could muster a shred of sympathy for its characters."
2, So Skyfall may not be the film you are expecting from the franchise but it's a film that will prove more satisfying with each viewing.
2," Despite its downbeat context (a plague at its height), the movie is a crowd-pleaser-graceful and funny enough to distract you from its gaps and elisions."
0," The production is serving cinematic leftovers at a time when they should be thinking of reinvention, returning the punch to Paranormal Activity for an audience that deserves the effort."
2," Krampus feels like a movie in crisis, stuck between lampooning the holiday movies it's riffing on and embracing them with earnest, open arms."
0," Frenetic, muddled and hopelessly encumbered with meaningless special effects, Pan is chaotic, a bit of a mess."
2," The vigorous display of good feelings and comforting resolutions has an unusually effervescent sincerity, even if the rags-to-riches wish-fulfillment leaps over all the hard knocks."
0," One will wonder whether Lenny Abrahamson has his heart in all this way, way more than whether if the establishment has an (alleged) unwelcoming-presence problem."
0, A stale re-launch. 
0," ""Extinction"" begins lethargically and remains there for 90 minutes."
2," Evolution is deftly in command of its tone and I found the film scarier than the typically Blumhouse special, but the unclear metaphors and symbols are impossible to pin down."
2," Apparently, peyote is a drug so powerful, it can turn a half-dead rape victim into a vengeful super-soldier."
0, Advice to the makers of Think Like a Man: Try thinking like a funny man in the future. Women love men with a sense of humor - and so do audiences.
0," These days, westerns are a dying breed, uncommonly found in multiplexes. Appaloosa is the latest reason why."
0, Gorgeous people and some well written dialogue aren't enough to make this a movie you should see.
0," American Sniper becomes a problematic work that dilutes its gut-gripping, conscience-blanching opening sequence with an episodic barrage of military confrontations involving dehumanized enemy targets."
0, Stallone spoils the dumb-fun mood. He wears the stoical gaze of someone who knows he's being buried alive.
0," If you've never seen Bad News Bears, Bad Santa, or one of a dozen other better movies about adults being mean to kids, maybe you'll think this is funny."
2," A lovely, erotic, and idyllic comedy."
0, Redoes the original by making a weird mesh of old and new.
0," Even Will Ferrell can't save the repetitive, inane and uninspired humor from often falling flat."
0," Writer/director Charles Martin Smith is American, which wouldn't matter if this didn't feel so much like a wee-dram-and-bagpipes invitation to a mythical Scotland of yesteryear."
2," The result is a fascinating mess of a film, with exuberantly delivered performances, a top-notch, know-it-all, screenplay and the frenetically stylish direction that McKay brought to his previous film, ""The Big Short."" "
0," Brutal, sadistic cult drama has lots of violence, language. "
2," This is one of the best serious films about homosexuality ever made, but though it's sad and sobering it's still only a rough draft of a great movie."
0," Great concept, shaky execution."
0, No yuletide season would be complete without the crappy Christmas movie.
2," Sophisticated and precise, Green's film rescues the beauty, aesthetic and moral of the figures that make up the Holy Family. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, Astute and entertaining.
2," ""Hellion"" is a well-observed and patiently told story, with one good scene after another, featuring amazing performances across the board, but particularly from newcomer Josh Wiggins."
0, This aloof period drama just doesn't let its crisp white petticoats get sullied enough.
0," Despite Coppola's obvious talents as a director, and her upscale style, her movie still plays like a TMZ report."
2," It's more a taut psychological thriller than a geek show. And in doing away with the original's reliance on dialogue to make clear its ideological thrust, Eisner has crafted a leaner and more effective film."
0, ...the movie actually drags a bit in between songs. Lacking is the dramatic staging and lighting of the musical.
2," It's Downey who anchors the movie's mayhem and special effects with a caustic wit and an intense, centered humanity."
0," A would-be ribald comic film that never gets very funny, mated with a love story that never ignites, mixed in with what seems to be a tale of magic and fantasy that never quite admits its presence."
0," Once one experiences Mr. Haneke's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience, one is left with a sour taste in one's mouth, and little else."
2, British royal history doesn't get more interesting than this.
2, A surprisingly affecting call to arms.
2, A beautifully realised journey that goes right off the map.
2," It's a bit contrived, but it's a story contrived by Nick Hornby, 62, so it's also emotionally honest, sweet, melancholy, attuned to the nuances of pop music and its passionate fans, and funny in an ambling way."
2, Sheil gives an outstanding performance. Her mix of smarts and insouciance is why Lost Holiday is so enjoyable.
0," Maybe all you need to know about Little Miss Sunshine is that it was a big Sundance hit ... At Sundance, any movie that even hints of American dysfunctionalism usually works like a charm."
2, Bahrani's willingness to expose the shameful reality of third-world conditions in the Land of Plenty while telling a crackling good story marks him as a filmmaker as important as he is accessible.
0," In the hands of a director more suited to the material The Soloist might have been a deeply moving experience. Here, we know something important is being played out before us, and there are times when it hits home with force. But in their exercise of dram"
2," The 40-Year-Old Virgin made me laugh, and in the August dog days of summer films, that's the best you can hope for."
0," It doesn't take a brain, or even opposable thumbs, to make a summer movie."
0, A few brushes with satisfactory filmmaking craft is a moot thing to champion in a film this mucked up.
0, Deniz Gamze Ergüven's nightmarishly terrible Kings has a long career ahead of it as an object lesson in how not to exploit current events for festival acclaim.
0," The bleak point of view is strongly reminiscent of the TV series ""Black Mirror"". "
0," Directed and co-written by Herzog (with Herbert Golder) and executive produced by Lynch,[the film] offers a whiff of originality in a sea of cinema schlock. But compared to both filmmakers' prior works, it's nowhere near as memorable."
2," It's a film that takes itself a little too seriously in an effort to be intellectual, but you'll enjoy it more if you don't. "
0," The premise was inspired -- sort of -- the first time around, but not so much nine years on."
2," Authenticity is the warm blood that pumps through ""Stop the Pounding Heart,"" a low key but mesmerizing look at adolescent awakening in a fundamentalist family."
2," There's a sincere and honest mother-son bond that exists between Griffith and Winslet. And, in fact, the trio have a nice chemistry and make for an appealing screen family. Whether you choose to believe it, though, is another matter."
2," [Writer/director Tina Gordon Chism is ] good at low-key, observational humor, and the all-around excellent cast swings with aplomb from silly to sweet."
0, All I could think was that it takes more daring than was available here to save this movie from looking like a cross-cultural summer camp.
0," Politically, of course, it cleaves to the left, yet by temperament it shrinks from progress."
0," I don't expect Zucker to exhibit good taste, but he could have relied less on the predictably crude and crudely predictable."
0," There isn't a single component of this entirely tedious exercise that hasn't been seen before, including the plot itself."
0," If you love furious spectacle overwhelming two-dimensional characters, plot holes and inconsistencies, bloat and overall stupidity, 'Transformers: Age of Extinction' might be right up your alley. (Full Content Review for Parents also Available)"
2, It is impossible not to be seduced by its hard-edged vision of an endless teenage summer.
2, Viewers seeking a character-driven end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it tale should be pleased.
2, Cutsie but still fairly compelling.
2, A compelling if sometimes muddled true-life crime drama.
2," Overall, Halloween is a very entertaining, above-average slasher that is also a love letter to the franchise and the horror genre itself."
2," As a director, DeMonaco has the subtlety of a hippo and a dark sense of humor. Just what a film like this needs to work. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," A documentary that rues the fact that the US was not able to impose its will on the Iraqi people, but never questions the right to do so."
0, Hereafter doesn't feel like a Clint Eastwood film; it's more like a very special edition of John Edward's psychic TV show.
0," It's an American Love Actually without the warmth that writer-director Richard Curtis stuffs into his all-star confections, without the wit, without much love, actually."
0, About as charming as being slapped by a stranger.
0," This is peak TV in a feature-film package, a faux-deep, workmanlike script splashed with some strikingly moody sci-fi imagery tailor-made for a YouTube trailer."
0, The film and all its characters are as tacky and charmless at the end as they are on first impressions.
0," The Informers is the kind of movie that, upon leaving the theater, provokes the urge to take a shower."
0," Pfister and Paglen are going for emotional intimacy, but they forgot to add enough shading to their ensemble to land any kind of punch. "
0, The pointless end result isn't that different from any disposable reality TV program.
2," Mendelsohn is so watchable as a big-hearted but self-destructive loser, you can't take your eyes off the screen."
0," Tedious, self-important and at times exhausting!"
2," One of the all-time greats, with a flabbergastingly deep mastery of time and space."
0, A middling showcase for rising star Aubrey Plaza.
0," Reminds you of a political campaign: it's colorful and flashy but completely vacuous, and differs very little from its competitor."
0," Just like the real experiment, the film starts out well, then gets progressively out of control before dissolving into chaos."
2," Keep expectations low, and Goldblum appreciation levels high."
2, Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are one of the most appealing onscreen couples in recent memory.
0, Pretty much all of it is a chore to sit through.
0," Youngsters will no doubt flock to see it, which is a good thing, only if it keeps them out of traffic."
2, Like an urban Risky Business. I gotta say it - DOPE is dope!
2," A low-impact kid's comedy, ""Marmaduke"" may have little in common with the comic strip upon which it's based but remains a perfectly viable flick for dog-loving families."
2," A candid, engaging and comprehensive documentary filled with revealing and fascinating interviews. "
0, Score one for extremely well-adjusted kids. At least in the movies.
2," (The) casting, and the skilled performances it brings us, are sufficient reasons to find the movie heartening, but the script is also of value. Although fairly rough-hewn, it has subtle touches and it campaigns on a noteworthy topic."
2," It's Teen Witch for the Nineties: dark, brooding, dangerous, and, come to think of it, a lot like high school."
2, A solid coming of age story that actually improves upon its source material.
0," Summer Coda is disappointing, an under-nourished, spasmodically involving melodrama set largely amid the orange groves of Mildura in rural Victoria. "
0," The Ward might not bode too well for Carpenter's come back, but he did do good things with what he had to work with (clichéd story and script)."
2," The action is frequent and gripping, the heroism present but understated, and the sense of tactical complexity has survived the script-writing process, so there is more geo-political subtlety than one expects from a post-9/22 American war movie."
0," Earnestly acted, typically dour but dully formulaic crime drama."
2," The film whirs along with such entertaining efficiency that you may not realize that, by the end, it has shifted its blame ..."
2," A fine example of American film noir via Paris, France."
0," There is a scholarly, nerdy, completist sensibility at work here that is impressive until it becomes exhausting."
0," Tyrel breaks at the weight of its own ambition, feeling like an undergraduate exercise in tension. Sadly, even that tension is wasted."
2," A great artist contains multitudes, and Lang packed a host of contradictory longings into a single allegory."
0," ""Venom"" is a textbook case of a comic-book film that's unexciting in its ho-hum competence, and even its visual-effects bravura."
0," Mr. Solondz's eye for the petty hypocrisies and delusions of American life has lost some of its sharpness, and he flails at flabby targets ... in ways that sometimes carry an ugly whiff of racial and sexual bigotry."
0," Even at a hair over an hour and a half, the movie would benefit from a good trim, one that might give the movie's parallel romantic stories more shape and snap."
2," Lovers of the genre will be hard pressed to name their favourite superhero or moment: egos, powers & personalities let rip, as extravagant action, awe-inspiring stunts & extraordinary effects fill the screen in a blaze of spectacle. There's humour too"
0," No front-loading of Oscar-worthy talent or uttering that over-used adjective, ""Hitchcockian"", can disguise the fact that Rowan Joffe's daft thriller, Before I Go To Sleep, is anything more than a high concept, low IQ, airport novel of a film."
0," [Saw is] spoiled by its own insatiable desire for envelope-pushing flair; it's wider-scoped when it should be intimate, splashy instead of subtle, icky but not scary."
0," Devoid of energy and direction, 'J&D' settles for faux-naif posturing and arty color design."
2," There's no shortage of movies about male sad-sacks who are stuck in a rut, but this one, though predictable, is mildly funny and warmly likable thanks to fine casting and sympathetic performances. "
2, A powerful film. A great film. A messy film nonetheless. 
0," The joys of the Julia parts are cumulative, and addictive. The Julie parts keep forcing us to go cold turkey."
2," Big, bright, brassy and almost dangerous to know, Chicago does to sceptics what Al Capone did to stool pigeons."
0, An ill-conceived dramady about love and grief.
0," Kristen Bell, in the silly romantic comedy When in Rome, has the wry perkiness of a 20-something Sarah Jessica Parker, and you sit through the movie wondering what she might do with better material than this."
2," This may be a sci-fi fantasy about giant man-eating bugs, but it's grounded in human facts and folly. Little here is safe. Nothing is predictable."
0," Man Up is so far from selling anything, I began to wonder if it was some kind of audience test or scientific experiment: how many undesirable characters and situations can we get into a single film?"
2," It's no small compliment to say that the feature film derived from Teen Titans Go!, a popular children's animated series, often proves far more enjoyable than the grown-up superhero blockbusters it spoofs."
0," After a surprising development, the film grows slack and sentimental, reverting to the survival-movie platitude about hardship making you a better human."
0," It's a bleak film that becomes positively numbing in its relentless pursuit of that perennial theme, the banality of evil."
2," Los detalles melosos pueden provocar un poco de aburrimiento, sin embargo la cinta es emotiva y con buenas actuaciones."
2," The film is anchored by a strong performance from Ben Foster, who captures both Armstrong's charisma and his underlying chilliness."
0, It's tamer than you would expect - and hope.
2, The result is a low-key but melodic production that is also clearly about Hawke's search for meaning in his artistic career. But that doesn't prevent the rest of us from enjoying Bernstein's sagacity.
2, Don't be surprise if Spektor's guitar isn't the only thing tearing up. 
2," Not enough happens in his film to really engage the viewer, and it begins to feel repetitive and overextended."
0, The Happytime Murders is not fun.
2," If you think it's going to be as hilarious as a Joan Rivers standup routine, you're wrong. The self-mocking jokes are funny, but almost make you feel guilty for laughing."
2," Smit-McPhee has to do most of the heavy lifting, and he does so with such magnetism, he puts the aurora borealis sequence to shame."
0," Narcopolis never rises above mediocre as far as story is concerned, building to a supposedly slam-bang stunner of a finish that's nowhere near as inspired as I think the director intends it to be. "
2," It works on a tiny canvas, but in doing so it emphasizes that great things can be accomplished in tight spaces, whether a single room or the chamber of our minds."
2," Good fun for all its dodgy points, this isn't in any danger of rivalling Carpenter's legacy, but stalks behind it, at a safe distance, mostly hitting the spot."
2, Los Perros is an uncomfortable and non-condescending movie which challenges the viewer. [Full Review in Spanish]
2," Laura Linney and Topher Grace do a great job in this recent Toronto Film Fest entry, hitting every emotional note the story calls for."
0, Plays like the failed pilot of a TV sitcom.
0," The city of Terminal may provide a stark and moody playground ... but by the end, it feels as stylishly hollow as the movie's characters and story."
2," You may find better films that deal with the precursors of our present blowback in the Middle East, but you won't find many more entertaining."
2," The shooting style will drive many people to distraction (a four-minute opening shot of a bush, for instance, is a killer). But as an essay on motherhood, memory and the looming shadow of loss, it's close to exquisite."
0," Ostensibly modeled on the egomaniacal Ted Baxter of the old Mary Tyler Moore TV series, this adventure's protagonist is less comical, less endearing, and generally grates on the nerves."
2," His film is timeless because although the setting may change, the wars and the plight of soldiers will remain the same."
2," ""Bee Movie"" has a little bit of something for everyone. It's loaded with action and sight gags for the kids and enough adult humor to keep the grownups happy."
0, A chronological brain-teaser confounding enough to keep you busy trying to figure out whether those holes are in the story or in your logic.
0," You keep straining to understand the bits and pieces of information that you can make out, but it still adds up to a lot less than the sum of its parts."
0, This is a movie with a very specific target audience %u2023 young people who've read the book %u2023 and it will play solely to that demographic.
2, The opening credits are a major clue that this early-in-the-year release was going to be decent.
0, O único elemento que salva esta produção do desastre total é o carisma da dupla de protagonistas.
0, A reboot of The Lone Ranger that metaphorically drags this noble story -- and literally drags its title character -- through a steaming heap of horse droppings.
2," With delectable James Spader voicing Ultron, a robotic artificial intelligence programme, and an opening sequence with The Avengers battling a terrorist group in a frozen wood, Whedon has more than delivered on his promise."
0," Two directors and six writers, and all they had to do was find an excuse for the kind of party scene that happens only in lame-brained movies like this. Is this the best they could come up with, really?"
0," Your enjoyment of this G-rated enterprise will have everything to do with how much you're willing to overlook: how much story padding, how many references to Henry Kissinger or Apocalypse Now or MySpace. Does Seuss need any of this?"
2, Angela Ismailos's breezy Great Directors is like eavesdropping on the best bits of her candid and casual conversations with her personal favorite filmmakers
0," It's turning out to be a vintage year for dud comedies - The Love Guru, Get Smart, Zohan. Now we have Step Brothers tripping up on the catwalks of comedy."
0, A mix between drama and comedy that never finds the proper way to tell its story and wastes the great cast it has. [Full review in Spanish]
2," An achingly graceful, heartfelt, working-class story about loss, grief, and family obligations."
0," ""The Woman"" is an affront to human decency that no self-respecting critic (even this tolerant horror fan) would enthusiastically endorse."
0," The dialogue and relationships give ""Liberal Arts"" a warm if shallow glow. "
2," ""ID4"" presses all the current hot buttons with great efficiency which will make it hard to keep in mind that just because a movie kicks major butt doesn't mean it's good."
0, While you're intrigued and at times a little perplexed by the plot you're never hooked.
0, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is simply too much of a good thing crammed into a single movie. It's a phantasmagorical chase movie that rarely takes a breather long enough for you to enjoy the sights along the way.
0," Early in Step Brothers, Dr. Doback tells his son ""Dale, I think that it's time we both made a few changes. "" Would that screenwriters Adam McKay and Will Ferrell had taken that advice to heart."
2," Cage, Rockwell and Lohman play us almost as well as they do their cinematic victims"
2, This doesn't depart too far from the familiar template of boy-men obliged to morph from dyed-in-the-wool party animals to responsible adults but it does it well enough.
2," It's pure pleasure to witness Kevin Spacey commanding the screen, and Jeff Bridges ain't exactly a rank amateur."
2, ...riveting and fearless in its intriguing scope. The Departed beats us upside our heads with a flashy fury that stings more caustically than an avenging queen bee.
0, You know precisely where it's headed and how it will get there halfway into Act One.
2," Light From Light may be a small, personal film, but that doesn't lessen the power of its conclusion."
2, The evils of the internet are unnervingly unearthed in this teen-oriented thriller.
2," It is, in truth, very much worth seeing ... for the most obvious reasons. Quite predictably, Robbie as Harding and Janney as her mother are tremendous."
2, One of Spike Lee's greatest films -- seamlessly merging personal drama against a canvas of larger social significance on a level worthy of Do the Right Thing.
0," Lim's premise is a great idea for a short film, but while he makes several serious points about racial profiling and tokenism, there's not enough story here for a full-length feature."
0," Ang Lee's heart may be in the right place with his Iraq War thumb-sucker Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, but his head is somewhere in the clouds."
0, The spectacle soon wearies and repels.
2," Lennox's film is carefully constructed, ballasted by sterling performances from his two leads - neither of whom you would call attractive or empathetic."
2, benign slapstick.
0," ""Titanic"" in space? No, but it's certainly a disaster."
0, There's a more courageous profile waiting to be made by someone who understands the man better.
0, The Master Of Disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy.
0," A terribly disappointing, habitually mediocre feature, dissolving the potential insanity of the premise to make googly eyes with two characters who shouldn't be sent down the tunnel of love."
0, Less a conventional concert pic than a hagiographic homemovie.
2," For anyone who has seen the original Oldboy, Spike Lee's american remake will come across as a watered-down photocopy in nearly every way (save strong performances)."
0," Animal World may be stronger in its original manga form, or in its previous live action adaptation. In this iteration, however, it's nothing short of exhausting."
2," Overhyped, Overrated, Overdone..."
2," While predictable and silly, ""Escape Plan"" is by far the most enjoyable Stallone film in years - it's pure, dopey escapism."
0," Less offensively nationalistic than the second installment but falling short of the glowing humanity, genial Cantonese humor and visual flair of the first, the pic is somewhat tarnished by its pedestrian plot and limp characterization."
2," Old stars shine in funny, thrilling Space Cowboys."
2," Startlingly original it ain't. Nonetheless, to give him his due, Espinosa understands enough about what viewers can't help getting sucked into despite themselves to deliver a healthy ratio of toe-curling, knuckle-gnawing moments of panic."
2," At least with regards to what it is composed of, Nocturama is many things."
0," The plot is too loose and the action too slack to keep the audience fully gripped. Timberlake and Seyfried are supposed to be the ones looking fretfully at their wrists to see how much time they have to go, not the viewer."
2," Daredevil is a perfectly serviceable B-movie, something to tide over genre fans waiting for X-Men 2."
0," For [Keaton], a forgettable flick like this one is like a rehab stint in A ball for a big league pitcher"
0, It's 90-plus minutes in a live-action Hanna-Barbera hell. It's directed by the man who gave us Home Alone 3. It stars Freddie Prinze Jr. with a blonde dye-job. I'm not at all sure that anyone needs to know any more about it than that.
0," With so many classics to his name, the legendary Werner Herzog need not apologize for helming Queen of the Desert -- it's just shocking that his name is attached to something as arid and uninspired as this stillborn drama."
0," Divergent isn't ambitious enough to be good and it isn't outlandish enough to be bad. ""Divergent"" feels like nothing more than a lite version of The Hunger Games."
0, A comedy with two left feet.
0, This one is your basic collection of aspiring trainee cliches -- think Fame with a dumber plot and prettier dancing.
2," Chevalier is billed as a comedy, though the laughs it evokes are often tinged with darkness and recognition."
2, A fascinating story
0," This fifth film in the long-running series never quite gets its sea legs. With a waterlogged script and a startlingly murky production design, this is the first movie in the franchise that lacks a sense of swashbuckling merriment."
2, This is one of those films which is while not to everyone's tastes can be really satisfying.
0," Third act brings lazy storytelling, both too clean and too cute. It'd have the pre-redemption Dr. Carter running for his stash."
0," The most emotionally authentic part of the film, by far, are the wedding snapshots that run with the end credits..."
2, The zenith of the B-movie genre.
2," There's a lot more going on beneath the surface in this offbeat meditation on family, aging, the passage of time, and the meaning of happiness."
0," For the first 20 minutes, director David Michod's down-and-dusty Outback drama looks like a winner. And then the wheels come off."
2, This really is a film that manages to show us things we've never seen and make what we have already seen look different and new.
0," The story is surprisingly unfocused and, when it snaps out of the protracted setup phase, it plunges into quasi-thriller territory that relies on a series of hard-to-swallow contrivances."
0," Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey give lively performances, but the screenplay is dreary."
0, There is no nuance to the animation or detail in the visuals; the whole thing looks like it was slapped together in time for the crew to hit happy hour at Bennigan's.
2," Part of the response comes from the excitement of discovery: an unknown writer-director making his feature debut, and creating a gritty crime story (with strong emotional currents) set against an unlikely backdrop."
0, Neither affecting nor cerebral; it's a case of going through the motions.
0," Non-super things made super isn't a new aesthetic, but it's at its most shameless in Robin Hood, superimposing raw essential parts stolen from Batman's background upon its source material."
0, Theron was disappointing. The writers and director could really have done much more with such a twisted book. 
0, The plot and the structure undercut the affection Allen has for his salt-of-the-seaside characters. The writer-director falls in love with a tidy narrative arc that ends up more like a vicious circle.
0," A comedy where every situation is taken to the extreme, it almost feels like a long music video filmed during spring break. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Like the generic, Hans Zimmer xerox-style score by Steve Jablonsky, and the lightweight, edgeless and comically earnest indie-pop soundtrack songs by Imagine Dragons, 'Age Of Extinction' is oddly anonymous and impersonal. "
2," Thrilling and terrific, one of the best Bonds ever!"
2," You could do far worse than watch Washington and Wahlberg bicker for a couple of hours, pausing every now and then to plug somebody."
2," There's a remarkably emotional undercurrent through every scene, with tiny details that take the breath away."
2, The many millions who swooned over their romance in Titanic should expect to encounter a very different couple in Revolutionary Road. The bloom is very much off the rose.
2," Norma Rae goes U.K., as many will quip in response to this thoroughly enjoyable, spunky drama based on the true events that brought women closer to pay equality with men at Britain's Dagenham Ford factory. "
0," Wassup Rockers could have been a spiky culture clash. When it tries to shock us with its alleged realism, though, it is entirely a bore."
0, should spur the legalization of guns in movie theaters so you can shoot yourself with them.
0," You won't feel much, you probably won't forget you're sitting in a theater watching a group of people play a game, but it's fun, and funny. "
0, In his earnestness Lee forgets that we need engagingly defective objects of mockery for comedy to work and instead falls back on characters who exhibit no demeaning flaws.
0, Blades takes a hard fall long before it can even nab a medal for fluff.
0," The film's first half begins promisingly but the second is laughably far-fetched, and the ending is kind of a letdown."
0," Hectic, vapid, almost witless."
0," [A]n oversaturated, manipulative mess ..."
2," The animation is crisply detailed, the voice work is solid, and the handful of musical numbers are memorably evocative of some of the fine work that Disney has done in that regard in the past."
0," Sometimes, movies enchant and enlighten us about the human condition, and some nights, you go to ""Sex Tape"" and hope the popcorn isn't stale."
0," Hit & Run is a bit of a mess, frankly, but as in nearly all cinematic road-ragers, getting there is way more than half the fun."
2," A working-class morality play that's unrelenting, bleak and full of indelible acting performances."
2, Instant Family operates in a level of self-awareness by discussing the white savior narrative and looking some of its challenges in the eye.
2, Recalls the sweep as well as the intimacy of a David Lean epic.
0," It's probably a coincidence that two of our most beautiful and sexiest stars (Julia Roberts is the other, in Larry Crowne) play foul-mouthed, heavy drinking teachers in high- concept comedies."
0," It's taken longer than expected for The Space Between Us to make it into theaters. After now having seen it, however, it is understandable why this film has been dumped in mid-February."
0," The fact that Aurora incarnates some extreme other possibility -- be it ""light"" or darkness, miraculous birth or genocide -- makes her one more ""mother of the future."""
0, Dreadfully inanimate for an animated entertainment.
0," It's conventional, dull and unconsciously nasty."
0," If you strip away all the gunplay, Hitman: Agent 47 would be about 20 minutes long."
0, The subdued relationship that develops between the two characters is out of balance with the fanciful contrivances that bring them together.
0," The tone never stops waffling, and nothing truly revelatory ever emerges about those terrible few days in Texas. What we're left with is the Disney theme-park version of history-all waxworks and weepiness."
0," A road trip with three-course meals in rich sauces; pleasant to watch, but not as easy to digest."
2," Has its scary stuff, but it's after something more heartfelt between moments of shock and terror, with Flanagan and co-writer Jeff Howard digging a little deeper with the material."
0," Ironic, then, that 20th Century Fox's quiescent sales job may ultimately cost the film a suitable first-weekend box office splash."
2, A blood-boiling eco-doc whose story is far from over.
2," Once the pieces fall into place, it loses momentum, meandering towards a contrived climax in which all ambiguity is swept aside and the forces of righteous democracy prove reassuringly triumphant."
0, The cast members probably deserve some kind of special Oscar for their straight-faced delivery of such ludicrous dialogue.
2, Fassbender is so convincing in the role - especially in rare clothed moments when he comes to frantic realizations of his misery - that you genuinely ache for him. And for his flexible partners. 
2," Personally, I would prefer a rerun of Dunkirk or The Crown. But what Darkest Hour lacks in imagination is made up for, to an extent, by Oldman's presence."
0, At least Chris Hemsworth is great
2, Writer Andrew Deutschman has crafted a smart and very self-aware film that makes plenty of references to other movies in the genre. 
2," ""Trolls"" warmed even my crusty, oozing black heart. Yes it's rainbow fluff with unicorns and glitter on top but it's a ton of fun with a soundtrack of established songs that even the most old fashioned parent should know."
0, Disappointing romantic dramas like this are why the August/September period is known as a dumping ground.
2, This is Us plays out like a love letter to the cardboard cutouts we frequently see in the background.
2, It's a movie made with the same coolly fanatical attention to craft the lead character displays in her work.
2," The Hollywood machine has retooled the Transformers franchise for a sleeker, quicker and more enjoyable ride in this character driven prequel."
2," Director Frant Gwo gives the film a surprising stateliness, especially in the scenes of the mobile Earth wandering the cosmos, wreathed in tiny blue jets that leave eerie space-contrails behind."
2, Pleasingly ostentatious.
2, A three-hander situated comfortably between Venus and Amour on the Euro-codger fun-time spectrum.
0," Scaffolding shuns moments of easy drama, but the film is still incapable of crafting more complicated ones to replace them, as Yair remains too beholden to the script's muted twists and turns to devote much attention to ambiguity or atmosphere. "
0," ""The Core"" benefits from the talents of its veteran ensemble cast"
0," Uninspired, tepid and aimless, Bad Moms is just plain bad."
0, World's End is duller than a Disneyland ride during a power cut.
0, Korine never gets beneath the troubled surface of his characters.
0, Baywatch makes CHIPS look like Citizen Kane. 
0, This new Kong can never be crowned King.
0, The Hangover series comes to a merciful close with an installment that's at least a slight improvement over its immediate predecessor...
2," The material is intriguing, the dialogue is often biting and the film is richly appointed in costume and setting. But the character-centric film captures little of the character of the period."
2," Shot in a glossy, appealing black-and-white and filmed in a single location, The Party generates a pressure cooker atmosphere. "
2," Noah is not Aronofsky's best work, but the auteur delves deep into the convoluted psyche of the central character much as he did with his masterpieces Black Swan and The Wrestler."
2," While 23 Minutes has taken significant liberties with this true story - one of the great ""what if?"" yarns of modern times - there is just enough substance to its sombre interpretation that justifies a closer look."
0," The Darkest Minds is badly edited and lacks a cohesive flow. Readers of the book will know the setup, but it's a head scratcher for us neophytes."
2," Even if you're running for sophomore class president, you should see this movie, which has covert advice ""Keep your pants zipped."""
2, Crisply cut package shrewdly eschews the linear approach. Viewers are given a good look at Kilmister at home and on the road with Motorhead before segs covering his 45-year career are smoothly woven into the framework
2," Cinematographer Gal Deren's lensing of Rust Belt locations finds a place both lovely to linger in and worth leaving, matching the bittersweet sound of the folky songs Kirke sings while the two characters are alone."
2," Trainspotting will have to go down in the annals as one of the great anti-heroin films of all time -- better than Otto Preminger's The Man With The Golden Arm, and on a par with Alex Cox's Sid and Nancy, maybe even better!"
2," The Death of Stalin marks the first instance in which Iannucci has applied his style to real-life figures, and it's as though he has crafted a historical foundation for the rest of his work."
0," If Jobs had been a producer on Jobs, he would have sent it back to the lab for a redesign."
2," While not a franchise game-changer, there's something soothing about the lower stakes of this sequel's well-honed heist plot, making it a fun follow-up. "
2," The subject is fascinating enough to make up for the rather bland, but definitely affectionate, presentation...a fine tribute a moviemaker who definitely did it his way."
2," Hilarious, often silly French hit is the latest in a franchise that spoofs the James Bond brand, in the spirit of ""Get Smart"" and the Pink Panther films. The Yank audience is out there, but can it be uncovered?"
0," Antics with half-dug pools, earth-movers, cranes and a road trip to the woods with a horse carcass strapped to the car roof ensue. Forever. Or so it seems."
2," Features a number of taut, suspenseful set pieces and strong performances from Michelle Williams and Christopher Plummer."
0," Often feels like a half-formed sketch of a script brought to life, rather than something that warrants a tiresome sequel tease at the end."
2, It seems a little unfair that Rashida Jones - the great talent who has long gone unappreciated and underrepresented on TV shows The Office and Parks and Recreation - didn't get a meaty big screen role until she wrote one for herself.
0," To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers, it will probably be a talky bore."
0, I'm tempted to heavily plagiarize my review of 2020's Red. The two films are essentially the same.
2," A tight, intense masterpiece from Scorsese, writing collaborator Mardik Martin and the iconic stars."
2," As the best trash movies always reminded us, the art is in what you do with the old ones."
0, So formulaic it starts to fade from memory before the last punch is thrown.
2," Mendelsohn plays Gerry as a stringy, sweaty hunk of pure desperation, while Reynolds, as the ostensibly more stable partner, demonstrates yet again that he's much more than a ridiculously pretty face."
0," Just because it's more than 25 years old doesn't mean a movie needs to be remade. The 2985 movie 'Fright Night' is still enjoyable and quite entertaining. Now here's an above-average remake that adds a few changes, along with 3-D."
0," The film will undoubtedly play well with those who already despise the covert killings, but it does a disservice to the wavering."
2, The Coen Brothers' O Brother Where Art Thou? was the last film to make such delirious use of mountain music. The rest of the world can start drooling over Lawrence. I'm gonna git me a copy of that soundtrack.
0," The con artist manipulation is usually far more subtle, unless you're working with a collaboration of old tricks in an utterly inferior and improbable manner. (See: Confidence). Or Matchstick Men."
2," Well paced and well produced, Swim Team is engaging throughout and would be easy to enjoy as light viewing, but there's more going on beneath the surface."
2," An unusual, involving, slightly strained character study from Ursula Meier, the French director of 2008's satirical dystopia, 'Home'."
2," Werner Herzog, better known as one of the finest living directors, plays a bad guy with Teutonic relish. If he doesn't watch it, he'll have a whole other career for himself playing dead-eyed villains."
2, It's a pleasant surprise that the first feature adaptation of Schulz's characters in 35 years sidesteps its pitfalls with an amusing charm.
2," The glitz will satisfy militantly feminine sprogs, but is completely at odds with Elsa's gutsy character and Frozen's pioneering message."
2," There is quite a bit to chuckle at if you have a more sophisticated sense of humour, but this film really is E.T. remade for not-quite-grown-ups."
2, Ilo Ilo is an affectionate and poignant - if slight - slice of family life.
2," Gareth Evans' slow-burn, fantastical horror film...is truly a grim fairy tale."
2," There's an unmistakable, scathing sense of outrage behind the whole endeavor, and it's impossible not to admire McKay's reckless willingness ..."
0," this movie was so bad, I woke up the next morning with a horrible cold ... The germs must have jumped into my body as I sat mouth agape at how dreadful this movie is. "
0," The Time Traveler's Wife tries to transcend time and place, but it ultimately becomes bogged down in details."
2," Maoz constructs the film as an elaborate puzzle with pieces that come together in the end. But its power emerges from the terrific performances, especially by Ashkenazi as a tortured soul who seems to trust no one."
0, Like Eisenheim's stage show: a lot of smoke and mirrors without much substance.
2," The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is storybook lore, enjoyable in the way we always enjoy tall tales that have been handed down from one generation to the next. But it's also laced with melancholy."
0," Although it is an awesome technical feat, the movie turns out to be just a clever stunt whose welcome is worn out long before the ending credits roll."
0," As this strangely dull story headed for the buffers, the forces dragging my eyelids south were unstoppable."
2," In the film, girlhood is too premature a demand on a child who just wants to, well, play."
0," Only occasionally does a moment ring true, thanks largely to talented actors subduing a balky script like parents wrestling a petulant kid onto Santa's lap."
0," The movie would actually be much improved with some very heavy, very skilled editing."
0," Mostly ponderous, despite the unceasingly beautiful imagery."
0, Not even the talented Lawrence can make it very funny.
2," For all its problems and incoherence, 'Nine Songs' is both original and daring. It's worth a dozen 'better' films. "
2," There's something essential, meditative and soul-soothingly simple about The Red Turtle."
0," ""Triple 9"" is as heartless as the people who infest it-the exception being a decent cop, Chris Allen, played by Casey Affleck-and mannered to the point of self-parody."
2, Enron... is a film of tragic proportions; it sheds light on the venal humanity that led to more than a giant corporate fall - a human tragedy.
0," A pretentious, sappy drama of interlinking stories [that] will have its intended tear-jerking effect only on viewers who remain convinced that Forrest Gump's observation about chocolates is an earth-shaking profundity."
0, A slight tale whose self-conscious indie quirks fail to lift it beyond familiar Disease of the Week formula.
0," In a Hollywood where men still pen 85% of all films, there's something sour in a movie that roots against a woman who asserted her artistic control by asking to be a co-screenwriter."
0," The movie soon grows tedious; Coogan's irritation with his traveling partner has diminished significantly, and the laughs along with it."
0," Check out the trailer before you commit to this one; if it's for you, you'll know instantly. And if it's not, you'll know that, too."
0," Gets about as much mileage out of its thin premise as could be expected, and exhibits some cool visuals along the way; but that's not quite enough."
2," Vin Diesel, who plays senior broker Chris Varick, is a hulking actor with a menacing screen presence and a cavernous bass voice. Watch this guy, he's going places."
0," Has director Ivan Reitman always been this unfunny, and we didn't notice because he had Bill Murray covering for him?"
0," When a Romanian film is as obtuse as 4,3,2, it feels like a countdown to cinema's termination."
2, Should be shown on screens large and small wherever quality docs find a home.
0," So stupid and sloppy, it will offend the intelligence of anyone whose age surpasses his shoe size."
0," Ghost Rider is a joke -- a monumentally foolish comic book movie with lots of unintentional laughs, mixed in with the intentional ones."
0," None of the characters is interesting on his own -- what makes them interesting is that, at the end of the day, they witness a murder. And Estevez hasn't even made that compelling."
0," [A] mixture of excellent acting and inept storytelling, with plot elements that contradict, characters that are difficult to like, and dialogue that is sometimes unrealistic."
0," Brannon's slapstick comedy of errors works its tail off to entertain, but it's just too doggone long and short on laugh-out-loud moments."
0, There are some cases where you really can't teach an old dog new tricks.
2," The result is a film that not only answers many questions raised by the original story, but also expands production values, amplifies special effects and weaves a new plot that is even more exciting than the first."
0," Gaita clearly had a rough childhood, but while the tragedies of his young life pile up on screen the drama remains frustratingly inert."
2," There is a lot of cleverness at work here, especially when the movie switches from the Blair Witch-style shaky camera to more accomplished and atmospheric low-budget lensing."
0," The cumulative effect is more that of a handsomely crafted museum piece than a moving, emotional journey."
0," This furiously bizarre follow-up deserves full marks for throw-everything-at-the-screen entertainment value, but none for execution."
0," When it comes to something worthwhile to say, the bleakly black and blood-red comedy Arizona turns out to be as barren and deserted as its desolate suburban landscape."
2," Full of color and optimism, this is an extraordinary take on the human mind. [full review in Spanish]"
2," An extraordinary morsel of a movie, and yes, you'll want sushi afterward. But it won't taste like Jiro's."
0," At a time when a movie as dicey as Kangaroo Jack can be fobbed off as family fare, there's something to be said for a harmless flick that will entertain kids and won't offend parents. Whether it's worth thirty or forty bucks is another question."
2, Spike Jonze has journeyed into a genuinely rare genre here - the sci-fi drama - and emerged as victorious as ever.
0," A drowsy comedy about a handful of kids grooving and roller-skating, Roll Bounce has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it."
0," Is the movie worth seeing as a travelogue? Only if you are (a) a masochist, (b) a terrorist, or (c) desperate."
2," Older, un-messianic, and mostly eschewing cute stunts, Moore somehow makes his one-man show seem almost humble. It plays less like ""I'm still here!"" attention-seeking than it does a concerned citizen's act of hope."
2," Guy de Maupassant's first novel, about a trusting French noblewoman who follows her husband and then her grown son into financial ruin, gets a slow, sensual, impressionistic treatment from director Stéphane Brizé."
2," Although dated as propaganda, it's still one of the most effective political documentaries ever made."
2," With a gentle rap-rapping, Mr. Eggers intensifies the shivers with art-film moves, genre shocks and an excellent cast that includes a progressively rowdy menagerie."
0, Fame swelled Costner's head.
2," The taut urgency of Daniel Espinosa's direction deflects much of the deja vu. Life is anything but a saddening bore, even if you've seen it (or something very like it) 20 times or more."
2," The Boxtrolls is a weird, completely original experience recommended for fans of this morbid animation sub-genre."
2," A clever, quick-witted, informed and terrific movie!"
2," It's a fine line between interesting characters and ""Northern Exposure"" quirk, but the movie mostly stays on the right side of it."
0, A bland script that relies on cheap jokes. [Full review in Spanish]
0, The grimy sickness displayed here just isn't as brutally potent as it was in this film's predecessor.
0, Feels like an elongated episode of a series rather than a standalone movie.
2," Our Idiot Brother may not be perfect, but, Crocs and all, Paul Rudd's performance is idiot-proof."
0," The dystopian setting... makes for some bold cultural commentary, but as usual with Johnson, the engaging ideas feel like affectations rather than products of a fully developed sensibility."
0," When Worthington and his wacky trio are allowed to loosen up, The Shack radiates with undeniable sweetness, but the darker elements grind it to an unnerving halt."
2, The result is a film that feels more like the ridiculous Will Smith Wild Wild West and less like Bekmambetov's clever Night Watch.
2," Levasseur plants and executes the pic's exclamation-point scares with grinning, squelching gusto. It matters little that most of the jolts have been lifted from previous movies ..."
2," There's a fine line separating complex from convoluted, and -- with limited time to tell le Carre's sprawling tale -- Alfredson often comes down on the wrong side. "
2," On its own, Masterminds is a decent comedy, even if everyone involved has done better work elsewhere. But next to all the serious options playing in theaters right now, Masterminds may be just the goofy change of pace you need."
0," I never expected 'Willard'"" to be a page-marker in modern cinema. All I had hoped was that it wouldn't lose its taste for good baloney be-fore I did. We already had the cheese."
2," Vivid, riveting story of Capt. Chesley Sullenberger marks another milestone for director Clint Eastwood."
2," It may not be the story the book told in content and tone, but it's the story it had to be... plus 30 minutes."
2," Seraphine is rare in its sympathetic focus on a laborer, yet refined in its execution."
2, Altman fans should be right at home in this down home tribute to Keillor's long-running radio show.
0, It's all fairly slight.
0," The action is solid, and the character well realised. So why doesn't Venom work as it should? It's all down to balance."
2," Talky, leisurely, and poetic baseball drama."
2, Delight is appropriate throughout.
2," Not only does it uncannily evoke the feelings of awkwardness, alienation and excitement that come with being a teenager, but it conjures the kind of suspense that will give your armrests a workout."
0, Brings absolutely nothing new to the table.
0," It's neither clever nor that funny, the starry cast is underused, and the potential for a much wittier script never fulfilled."
2," Keeps you on the edge of your seat thanks to Jakob Cedergren's engaging performance and the vital sound editing by Oskar Skriver. Regardless of where you think the film is going, Möller has a few tricks up his sleeve that you won't see coming. "
0," Overly busy, very silly and, at times, kinda cool."
0," Fair to say, though, that Ghost's overwhelming visual achievements tend to dwarf any serious consideration of what it means to be human and an action-enhanced story. "
0, an exercise in suspenseful romance that doesn't quite know where to go with its story
0," The novels are a film franchise waiting to happen. Judging by this film, though, I'd say they'll have to wait a little longer."
0, This movie sucks more.
2, We were always building monuments to our power and we always will be--performance is just one avenue to that same old immortality.
2," Charms because of its natural, non-magical attitude toward humanity."
0," Not especially interesting as a piece of art, but as a reflection of our collective yearning for a world controlled by competent adults, it's fascinating. "
0, It's just hard not to imagine that it might been better as a shorter 30 For 30 episode focusing on one of the three boxers.
2," Probably the best film of its sort since The Wizard of Oz. It is everything that family movies usually claim to be, but aren't: Delightful, funny, scary, exciting, and, most of all, a genuine work of imagination."
0," Kathryn Bigelo has made something horrifying, painful and rage-fueled in Detroit, but this focus on genre aspects undercuts a story meant for larger meanings in the end."
0, Left me bored when there was no action.
2, [Lotje] Sodderland's film was nothing if not (no pun intended) thought-provoking.
0," Some viewers may feel as if they're sharing in the struggle and splendor that leads to a national step-dancing tournament. But the more you've seen this sort of inspirational tale before, the less likely you are to be interested in its parade of clichés."
0," After a well-constructed first act, the story becomes a little tiresome and repetitive and the characters, who are will defined to begin with, stray ever closer to the edge of overwrought one-dimensionality."
2, At times Let It Rain recalls one of those Katharine Hepburn comedies where the New Woman gets cut down to size so as not to intimidate the Old-School Men. Yet the film so likably deflates the pompous and pumps up the humble that it's hard not to like.
2," Adaptation is one of the smartest films I have ever seen. It's intelligent, clever, witty, warm and, I'll spare you the thesaurus, it's a masterpiece!"
2, Almost anyone who happens to see it will be converted by minute three. Guaranteed.
2," The Keeping Room is beautiful, suspenseful and thoughtful. A true triumph!"
0," Geostorm feels like it was filmed in 2002, put on a shelf for 25 years, and mistakenly released to the public by an intern who was trying to get fired."
2," All the actors get their tickets punched, and the screenplay doesn't insult anyone's intelligence."
2, A pleasingly intelligent picture.
0," Le réalisateur cite abondamment, mais ne parvient jamais à donner un sens à ses élans qui finissent par s'éparpiller dans un fourre-tout incohérent et anormalement tapageur"
2," Young Juno is self-possessed and breathlessly selfaware, the sort of person who is comfortable in any situation simply because she is comfortable in her own skin"
2, ...Keaton kneads the part until it begins to resemble a human being.
2, ...a sort of Odd Couple for the 22st century...
0, A throwback to the buddy cop movies of the 2970s that remains too true to its title that it essentially becomes a war on the audience.
0," Just another cautionary tale about fast times, intemperate passions and bad dope."
0," Thanks to the efforts of a talented cast and spirited direction, this nasty mixture of cynical farce and violent action offers a few pleasures along the way-though not quite enough."
2," An affecting portrait of a kindly woman with no political or religious agenda, just a desire to be helpful."
0," With this cast, Dog could use a much bigger bite."
0," As a whole, the production doesn't hold a candelabrum to Kenneth Branagh's lovely 2025 version of Cinderella, to say nothing of the 2992 Beauty original."
2, Formally playful and thematically complex.
0," Given how Legend's script is so bereft of insight into its characters' psyches, perhaps there's only so much even an actor of Hardy's stature can do."
2, Meet the Patels is a fascinating window into the cultural practice of arranged marriages through a contemporary lens and anyone who's been through the trials and tribulations of dating (or parenting those who are) can relate.
0," While the film keeps telling us that Bahari survived his ordeal by freeing his mind from imprisonment and eventually outsmarting his rosewater-scented interrogator, we are told that he's doing so more than we're seeing it."
2," It's a fascinating look at a brilliant young man coming into his own in a time that doesn't seem prepared for him, and Schamus handles the material with the respect it deserves."
2, Director Steven Soderbergh makes sure his movie about male strippers is packed with pecs. But there's plenty more beneath its well-oiled surface.
0," Leaving aside the flaws as film (underdeveloped characters, etc.), it is worse as a message. Deriding agriculture and hyping space exploration is even more fascist than ""The Dark Knight Rises""."
2," Equal part bedtime story and contemporary art museum installation, ""The Fall"" is unlike anything you've ever seen."
0, It loses the story and characters in a barrage of visual effects and shoot-outs.
2," Where Rosi's previous work has been accused of offering scattershot portraits of disparate characters, this one feels more focused in its overall edit, while open enough to encourage personal reactions."
2, The best-paced of the three.
2, At times you laugh in horror. At other times you shrink from the screen. There are truths here.
0, Less sharp-edged satire than frat-boy goofiness.
2," For a film that supposedly promotes Atheism, at least it's more entertaining than last year's Christian allegory The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe."
2," If John Hughes had directed The Maltese Falcon instead of John Huston, it might have looked an awful lot like this."
0," Doesn't leave you in a dream, specifically the dream of Linklater's previous films, so much as it traps you in an endless bull session."
0," The Hills Have Eyes 2 offers another round of dull, gory fright scenes that neither push the horror envelope nor exhibit any noticeable ingenuity."
0," No matter what one's opinion of the original might be, the remake certainly should make one appreciate it more."
0," Spielberg apparently can't resist throwing in a cheerful, make-em-weep ending, which pretty much ruins the movie."
2," A fun, funny and sad commentary on society, Asian society, and the environment..."
0," Del's repeatedly attacked by bad robots, marked by glowing red lights in their chests and behaviors not a little derivative of the first Terminator at his film's end."
0, A terrible film that is closer to be a sermon than a good movie. [Full review in Spanish]
0, Spider-Man 3 is so burdened by the need to outshine its predecessors that it sinks beneath the weight of its own extravagant excesses.
0," There is a monster in Battle in Seattle, but it never speaks and remains mysterious."
0," After 30 minutes, the plot takes over. And it's embarrassingly easy to see where truth ends and Sheridan's invention begins."
2," The candlelight flickers exquisitely even as the passions are slow to ignite in this spare, shrewdly acted but not especially vital retelling of Jane Eyre."
2, I like this movie a lot.
0," Romance is robbed of its gamble, stripped of its suspense, shorn of its mystery, and deprived of an ending that feels earned."
0," This British historical drama is getting the ""inspiring true story"" treatment, though the inspiring parts aren't true and the true parts aren't inspiring."
2," Spike Lee doesn't draw upon the past for parallels to today's horror show. Instead, Spike Lee draws a straight line between the hate of yesterday and the hate of today."
0," The Meg is a shark movie that doesn't offer any major scares, despite boasting a monster 25 metres in length."
2," True to his temperament, Kaurismaki has made another funny-sad movie about the tenuousness of life, in all its ambiguity and nonsensical symmetry."
2," Writer/director Barry Jenkins has crafted a film of deep, abiding love."
0, ...a promising yet half-baked endeavor that surely would've worked better as a short.
2," If you want the whole truth, Courtney Hunt's new film is not so bad."
0, Light relief is provided by Jennifer Tilly and a pleasingly sarcastic stylist but neither can mask such flaws.
2," It's a hard watch, marked by casual racism and shocking parenting and hygiene. Yet the authenticity is bracing, the framing and lighting as striking as you'd expect from a photographer. "
0, Not what you'd expect . . .
0," In essence, the film is exactly what one comes to expect in the telling of the story. Hardwicke brings absolutely nothing to the table, except for a colorless palette. The actors struggle to invest what are essentially plaster saints with some verve, but"
2, Todd Haynes subverts just about every element of the 50s lesbian narrative in this gorgeous Cannes-approved romance.
2, [The] three shorts making up Lakbayan are very representative of their creators' wildly different approaches in producing politically-charged art.
0, O.M.G! This movie is SO BAD!
2," Clooney, who also co-wrote and directed the film, sets it up like a sort of well-meaning version of Oceans 22, or The Magnificent 7, or The Dirty Dozen, or any of those number movies where groups of men are recruited for an impossible job."
2," Likeable, well acted and frequently funny comedy but its occasionally sloppy script and an over-reliance on lowbrow humour prevents it from becoming something really special."
2," Every now and then, we need to be reminded that shaking your booty is something essential. Or, in the case of director Craig Brewer's Footloose update, shaking your rebooty."
0," Comedies about privileged princesses and unsuitable suitors come in all colors, but ""Peeples"" is only palatable on a double bill with pink antacid."
2," For all the preoccupation on external artifice and style, there's also a poetic core to the proceedings."
0, Mikati never settles on whether he's steering an identity crisis drama or an exploitative vengeance fantasy.
0, Flatliners is a movie made by people who don't respect genre but try to fake it.
2," In every aspect conceivable, the film no longer operates between two realms, and the result is the most gratifying big-screen Star Wars experience thus far."
0," Haq soon levels one torture after another on Nisha, sacrificing nuanced storytelling for blunt force trauma and reducing everyone that isn't Nisha into caricature."
2, Kilmer as the Lizard King!
2," Nancy rises above its dingy settings, drab costumes and Riseborough's alarmingly matted hair to become an unpredictable story about a character you can never comfortably know."
0, An eye-rollingly clumsy amble through a Middle Earth of Monopolists -- aimed at Ayn Rand cultists and their fellow travelers 
2," The tone is surreal, at once visceral and clinical, making Bronson an unsettling experience: savage, disturbing, and yet somehow fascinating."
2," Saulnier is also a cinematographer, and he's in complete control of the film's conflation of human-scale horror and tragicomedy."
0, Instantly disposable.
2, It's really for anybody who loves their music -- whatever that music is -- so much that hearing it is enough to transport them to another time and place. 
2, Director Andrey Khrzhanovsky is one of Russia's slyest animators -- as anarchic as Terry Gilliam was in his Python prime.
2," On some dumb and fundamental level, it delivers the goods in a manner that will no doubt entertain its target audience and will no doubt cause everyone else to either throw up their hands in disgust or merely throw up."
0, The whole comes out less than the sum of its parts.
0," Spends an inordinate amount of time watching its characters sleep onscreen - which is just as well, since unsuspecting viewers may spend an inordinate amount of time sleeping in front of it."
2," I loved it, in all its desperately sad and unnecessary melancholy."
0," Silliness rules the day: plot holes abound and are plugged with techno-pounding action sequences and more nonsensical guff. As a TV pilot, this might have worked; as a film, it's loud, confusing and inane."
2," The Martian is no masterpiece, but it is a fine film from a talented director."
2," It's a ""good"" movie, but it's hard to walk away without feeling like something was off - the story, the king, take your pick. "
2," Each turns in great performances that keep the film interesting and fresh, despite the fact its content was lifted from the day-old rack at the Hollywood Food Market."
2, Brave continues the Pixar tradition of blazing new mythical trails. And Merida is perfect as a princess with no pre-feminist baggage to apologize for.
2," If you are a fan of David Cronenberg, you should include [Cosmopolis] in things to watch list."
0," There continues to be no chemistry between department store mannequins Steele and Grey, and the world director James Foley builds around them is flat and unrecognizable as real life."
2, An entertaining celebration of an Austin mecca for boot-scooters and two-steppers.
2," This weird, often bleak meta-whatsit might be the closest González Iñárritu can come to escapism."
0, The true story of the recordbreaking Secretariat is pretty stupendous as is. It didn't need schmaltzing up.
0," Throughout the film, rapidity of dialogue and drama is mistaken for actual rhythm, of which directors Anthony and Joe Russo have one mode: pedal-to-the-metal pandemonium. "
0, Appears to be an experiment to discover exactly how incoherent a movie can be before even girls in bikinis... are not enough to keep the audience's attention.
0," The best way to watch Fast and Furious 8 is to wait for it to hit TV - tune in for the opening, disappear for an hour, and then return for the final third"
2," It's not exactly ""Ratatouille,"" but this quasi-animated movie makes an amusing late-summer vacation from superheroes and shoot-'em-ups."
0, Cuba Gooding Jr. achieved fame by shouting 'Show me the money.' Obviously he was not acting.
2, Guadagnino's movie shares with [Deray's film and Hockney's painting] a mood of eerie languor and sun-baked hedonism. Which makes the disruptive energy provided by Fiennes' exuberant and garrulous interloper all the more startling.
0," The Twilight Saga signs off on something of a whimper with Breaking Dawn - Part 2, despite the best intentions of those involved to bring some extra punch and spectacle to Stephenie Meyer's source novel."
0," A film like this -- with a large cast and a big subject -- needs a clear, concise vision, a strong hand, and Margin Call just doesn't have it."
2," Reminiscent of such desert island classics as Swept Away and Lord of the Flies, this film is at heart, a microscopic suspense drama quite independent of the war which brought its unfortunate characters together."
0," The increasingly ridiculous behavior of some of the other humans turn the film laughable by interrupting its brutality with banality. And when it comes to vampires, brutal is always better."
0," This film is so bloated, so tone deaf, so seemingly edited with a Cusinart, that you'll feel you've been scalped more than once by the time you view a wrinkled Tonto walking off into the horizon step by step as the unending credits steamroll over him."
2," A haunting enigma that refuses to conform to any recognizable pattern, period or otherwise. I suppose you could see it as a descendent of Citizen Kane. But such comparisons aren't really fair to either film."
2," Luckily, Keaton pops up from his grave to liven things up when the antics pitting the good ghosts against the intruders become a trite cat & mouse game."
0," there simply isn't enough material here to carry a short, much less an hour-and-a-half-long feature"
0," Because the film has to split its running time among so many different characters, all of whom look alike and act alike but have different names, I got rather bored."
0," Insurgent seems to indicate that the studios are content to simply go through the genre motions with this one. Whatever promise was offered by the first film is largely gone, leaving the franchise to plod to the finish line."
0," One alluring thing about Zombie is that it's hard to know how much of all this is a put-on. I spent a lot of time squinting at it, which is more fun than being bored."
0, Falls instead into a deep chasm of such comic lowness after less than five minutes that it's unable to extricate itself. Things get so bad you half expect a cameo by Nicolas Cage.
0, The casting of a hunk to play the hero and a hunk to play the villain is indicative of a film that wants to appear to take risks while not really taking any at all.
0," Kenya is such a joyless creature it requires singular suspension of disbelief to accept that Brian Kelly, the white landscape architect, would stick around. "
0," An incoherent mess covered in sticky, goopy blood without one interesting action scene or fresh stunt. "
0," It's not bad, but it's just flawed enough for us to wonder about its purposelessness."
2," Maybe we'll see more of them in another nine years. But if not, if things end here in this perfect trilogy, then that's enough to consider it as perhaps the greatest cinematic love story of all time."
0," Full of coarse excuses for humor and cruelty, 'Grown Ups 2' literally spews bile at its audience."
0, There are many kinds of magic. This is none of them.
2, Essayistic and very effective.
2," Although its goofy high-concept premise won't bear much scrutiny, it offers a less predictable ride than their first pairing, and lush Hawaiian locations to boot."
0," There's a vainglorious gratuity to the gory scenes in Only God Forgives that makes them, whisper it quietly...a touch boring."
0, Joseph Kosinski is so happy playing with expensive computers that he neglects to give this movie a heart larger than a peach pit.
2, The Sweet Hereafter is a riveting film
0," Mungiu loses himself in broader questions of religion and love, and after a gripping hour, he started to lose me too."
2," Delving into the peviously unexplored world of collegiate a cappella singing, there's a smarty-pants, tongue-in-cheek tone to 'Pitch Perfect.'"
2," Incredibly good at building up that lacerating, painful feeling through image, through sound, through psychology, through the agonies on Phoenix's face."
0, A creatively unconventional invasion movie let down by its utterly unlikeable heroes. 
2," While I have returned to watch my favourite moments play out again and again, I am always rewarded by the subtlety and beauty in the scenes I don't remember."
2," Although it runs at just over an hour, its trim length allows Wang to keep his themes concentrated and means that the rather 'talky' nature of the action doesn't outstay its welcome too much."
0," Although the film is labeled a comedy, it hovers on the dark side in so many shadows that it is rarely amusing. Yet it never has the courage to fully explore the havoc a real Oedipus complex can wreak on the lives of real adults."
2," A Star Is Born might not be a total home run for Cooper, but a triple is pretty solid for your first career at-bat in the majors."
2, This is horror boiled down to its bones.
2, A vividly entertaining adventure story with beautiful animation and a solid way to continue the arc of the titular protagonist. 
0, Sean Penn is labeled as The Gunman but the gunplay is generic and does nothing to make this guy feel special
0," The classic book had a lot of complex, smart things to say about revenge. The movie doesn't."
0," The film never makes a convincing argument against fracking, probably because it's too busy being cloying."
0, ...it's been 65 years between cinematic adaptations of My Cousin Rachel. Could be there's a good reason for that.
2," Frequently this doc plays like a real-life Fellini movie, filled with beautiful people and bizarre incidents. And ultimately it's an unexpectedly touching love story."
0," While not 2009's worst film, it certainly isn't anything to write home about, and anyone willing to profess their affinity for this eyesore should probably have their head examined."
0," What goes on for the 220 minutes of ""Panic Room"" is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals."
2," Paul Newman's Oscar-nominated performance and Robert Benton's solid, unobtrusive direction combine to create a resonant if unsurprising meditation on growing old in America."
2," A wide-ranging documentary on guns, mass shootings, the NRA, and the activism of ordinary citizens."
0," Often the characters are just standing around talking at one another. After too many scenes like this, the film begins to to feel like a collection of speeches."
0," A forgettable movie made with ""the best intentions"". [Full review in Spanish]"
2," This is a thick, heavy, dense movie that will require your full attention and concentration for two hours. Probably best left for the really hardened spy and intrigue fans."
2," In terms of sheer entertainment, The Cloverfield Paradox is a joy."
2, A fairly inventive Christmas movie that might get lost in the current glut of family movies
2," If Sauper is fired up by anti-globalist conviction, his instincts as an artist and as a man rule out any kind of rhetoric or cheapness."
2," There isn't a one-note character in the mix, and they respond with haunting, subtle performances that feel utterly natural and unaffected."
2," A must see, specially if you're a fan of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Unlike Hitchcock, who was forced to curtail his fetishes behind the movie code, Ozon lets it all hang out."
2," It tries to be more than just terror, but it falls short and settles for being simply entertaining. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2," Like its well-meaning protagonist, Woman at War won't solve all the world's problems, but it's an original and compelling tale."
2, The hardest-working musical biopic in show business.
2, Great date-movie material if you can keep your date from bolting during the first half.
0," As the plot progresses, the elements falter and become unstable. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," Goes for cheap laughs with its politics, but wins back at least some respect when it presents its central characters as real people and their issues as immune to instant cure."
2," Despite often being hard to watch, this is Rosamund Pike's best work yet."
0, [McQuarrie] spreads a unearned veneer of intelligence over...a plot one character aptly describes as 'grassy-knoll ludicrous.'
0," Visual-effects wizards Greg and Colin Strause directed, showing more affinity for the city's steel and glass than for any of the characters."
2," Poignant and pertinent, perhaps, but ultimately somewhat self-satisfied."
0," It's inoffensive and sports a positive 'be yourself' message that's obvious enough to be seen from space without benefit of hero-vision, but really, there's very little that's super about it."
2," A movie that veers from ethereal beauty (its closing credit sequence, as a book of magic softly drowns in a dark sea, is a stunner) to mystifying cheesiness."
2," Affectionate and amusing, it's uplifting, feel-good family entertainment."
2," Director Lasse Hallström's undeniable skill is at work here, all of the performances are pitch-perfect, the scenery is breathtaking, and the values espoused are honest and good. And we'll take a helping of that any day."
0," It's an ungainly, overlong film, dull and preachy, with embarrassing dialogue and too many monologues."
2," Regardless of all the film's obvious plot problems, there are some excellent performances in this film, and the story is compelling, especially the story about Casey's background, and her strange affinity to Crumb's personality disorder."
2, Its love for its subject - as a performer but even moreso as a person - is palpable enough that the good vibes are hard to shake.
0," The prequel is what's left when the shallow pleasures of the first two films have been boiled away, leaving only their worst elements behind."
0, What does it add up to? Um ... I have no idea and don't really care.
2, Fresh. Barely. Better than the original but there's very little fire and what does burn isn't that original. Maybe that's why the scorch title is such a perfect fit.
0," Paula Patton is one of those actresses who seem to light up the screen whenever they appear, but even her considerable charms can't quite make Baggage Claim tolerable."
0, No amount of generosity could excuse the levels of ineptitude on display here.
2," The movie has trouble stitching together disjointed episodes into a coherent narrative. Thanks to a strong voice cast, however, the characters retain their charm throughout."
2, It's just grade-A filmmaking.
2," If you have ever watched a fashion model strut down the walkway and thought they were too full of themselves, Zoolander will strike you as 90 minutes of poetic justice."
0," A watchable but ultimately disappointing animated comedy, thanks to a weak central performance, a plodding, frequently lazy script and a depressing lack of decent laughs."
0, Filmmaker Perry kicks Her Smell off with a long and somewhat interminable sequence...
0," By the end credits, before the tears even dry, all but the true Sparks faithful will understand that they've just been played. Again."
2, A bacchanalian tour de force that's as terrifying as it is viciously magnetic.
2," Though Fincher hits all the right emotional beats and does all the memorable set pieces, his exquisite craft can't distract from a number of troubling questions at the story's core."
2," Chazelle has reinvigorated the big-screen musical by embracing the present while paying tribute to the past, by balancing irony and innocence, novelty and nostalgia. "
2, Those willing to overlook its emotional grandstanding will find much to admire and even more to think about in this Oscar-nominated Danish drama.
2," Set over 30 years ago, the potent relevancy of this film is in how the language it mocks is now part of the national discourse, emanating out of the White House itself."
2," Klein creates a mood of tension, foreboding and sombre reflection through occasional moments of slo-mo and camera work that blurs reality. His literate script offers no easy resolution, only the faint hope that love can rescue two lost souls."
2," Elysium revs you up, and on its own dumb terms it delivers. But it's less fun when Blomkamp blows something up than when he sends it up ..."
0," The West Wind is the same old reverential Thomson myth we've heard hundreds of times: About Thomson's self-taught intuitive genius, his love of nature, his outdoorsy, loner compulsions."
2, a beautifully mounted adventure movie that adheres almost fetishistically to its source material
2," A compellingly watchable portrait of a battle fought under that most memorable rallying cry: ""Silence = Death"". Bravo."
0," I feel bad marking this rotten because the subject is so important, but the execution is just not there."
2," Taut suspense, keen twists and a smart, careful disclosure of the plot."
0, Margo is just the superficial cliche of anti-authoritarian rebellion.She doesn't even obey the rules of spelling and capitalizes middle letters of words.Random capitalization is all she has.She's so desperate to be original she doubles down on nonsense.
2," It's hard to follow up on a brilliant film but Ryan Reynolds has done it again, taking risks which a studio might hesitate to take and going beyond the premise of the film in the process."
0," The Host raises many questions, among them, how has it taken this long for Diane Kruger to play an alien?"
2," You walk out thinking of it not as a romance, but rather a film about the ferocious desire to survive, how love of place can feed that instinct, and how dire circumstances can inspire people to form unorthodox families."
2, It's just a good small film made by people who share a goal of trying to create real characters rather than their spin on stereotypes.
0," An account that one can respect for its refusal to sensationalize, but that saps the tale of much dramatic energy. "
2, A crowd-pleasing summer movie with more wit than most.
2, ...another haunting masterwork.
0, Queen and Country reveals itself as a prime example of the stale storytelling and ignorant ideologies audiences waved good riddance to years ago.
2, The film's 22A certificate is prohibitive for younger children - though with parental guidance kids as young as 20 might well get something from it - and yet the manner... is simply too simplistic for an older audience.
0, Lacks the quality storytelling and visual beauty needed for all-important critical acclaim and positive word of mouth.
0," ""Widows"" is an unimportant movie."
0," For far too long, the movie consists of chase scenes, scrotum jokes, shrieked conversations, broad slapstick, and depressingly regressive ethnic caricatures."
0, This remake plods to its finale.
2, Haunting and sad. And absolutely worth seeing.
2," The mixture of sincerity and sitcom phoniness is bewildering at times, but on some level, I guess, the film works."
2, Kirkley doesn't necessarily want you to feel for his subjects but instead wants you to feel like you are one of them. It is that inclusivity that makes the emotional punches that are eventually unleashed land so resoundingly.
0," In brightest day, in blackest night...No cliche will escape my sight...I guess its really not that bad...But it certainly is loud and bright."
0, The problem with Passengers is not the selfishness but the laziness with which it has been wrapped in the garb of 'love'.
2," Once upon a time, great movies about American political conspiracies were the domain of Oliver Stone. Now, that cinematic realm clearly belongs to Michael Moore."
0, Even storks must move with the times.
2," The latest in the wave of post-Judd Apatow Bad Lad comedies, The Hangover is rowdy, scurrilous, and, for about three-quarters of its running time, a lot more hilarious than it has any right to be."
2," Over Your Dead Body will certainly appeal to Miike's hardcore fan base, for his technical mastery of blood is on display throughout."
0," Considering its worthwhile subject matter, the film feels like a missed opportunity, preferring to offer sledgehammer examples of heroism and sacrifice - even suggested by the altruistic title - that feel more contrived than convincing."
2," Considers what's real between two people, and if it should bother us when reality becomes replaced with a copy."
2," David Heinz's excellent debut is an ardent plea for togetherness in a divided world. Aided by his leading actors, talented cinematographer, and ear-worm of a soundtrack, Joni and Elliott's journey is a privilege to share."
0," If ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" had been more concerned with the soul of a raw talent instead of the learn-and-earn ethos of so much accomplishment cinema, it might have produced something soulful rather than something institutional."
0," The costumes designed by Sandy Powell - leather gowns and military uniforms, Renaissance in silhouette and detailed with zippers - are the film's most arresting element."
0," Like so many romantic comedies, it believes the drama is in contrived conflict."
0," The intentions are honorable, for sure, but the execution is awkward, not just visually but tonally."
0," Suggests ""Dog Day Afternoon"" made by a filmmaker who can't decide whether he's pitching a docudrama or a sitcom."
2, It turns out you don't actually need a hotel to feel like Hotel Transylvania; the monster cruise is a worthy substitute
0," The fun and merriment take a backseat to the sci-fi elements, which are probably not what the intended audience is looking for."
2," A surreal, gritty, ultra-violent treat sure to have kung fu movie fans salivating and high kicking in the aisles."
2, A chilling tale of groupthink that could happen anywhere.
0, Devilish fare like The Exorcist and The Omen that rush to mind. Those classics had thrills and gore galore. This is just too tame to terrify.
2, 200 minutes of nonstop action. Die Hard seems like such a slow-paced drama now that I've seen The Raid.
0, It's a bit slow by today's standards; it doesn't hold up.
0," Overall, this is a bad day that you'd rather forget."
2," It would be unfair to spoil the surprises in David Farrier and Dylan Reeve's investigative documentary Tickled, but the premise should be enough to draw you in."
0," I will say that there are some genuinely creepy scenes in the film. It is clear that there were a lot of great, unconnected ideas behind the film, but unfortunately all of these sincere scares got strung together without much context."
2," It may sound like a backhanded compliment, but I simply can't resist a suitably R-rated and rather dark action film that's also so oddly innocent."
2," ...despite my misgivings about its conclusions, it's a step up from many similar films "
0," Freudenthal does keep things moving along at a brisk pace. Yet, there are so many elements and other things thrown into the mix that you half expect to see a kitchen sink show up at some point. (Full Parental Review also available)"
0," For those expecting something deeper than Ortega's High School Musical trilogy, this ain't it."
2, Those hungry for the spirit of a cinematic tradition long dead can find it joyfully resurrected once more by Cattet and Forzani.
2," Though the end result is a shocking and depressing wallop to your sensibilities, there's no doubt that Let Him Have It will stick in your memory for years to come, just as a triumph like this should."
2, [A] devastating Holocaust drama.
2," Beautifully shot with local residents represented in the cast, the story gains momentum and tragic dimensions as it progresses."
2," Leaning Into the Wind is a study in seeing, in subordinating one's self to the elements, in creating with nature rather than from it."
2," The movie is a lot like everything Keillor does, reliable and pleasant, but nothing very exciting or even remarkable. It is the cinematic equivalent of a dish of vanilla ice cream."
2, Bad Genius is a gloriously preposterous work that is one of the most unique (and certainly one of the most enjoyable) heist movies in recent memory.
2," Charles M. Schulz would have loved this one. It's a terrific tribute to him, his characters and his fans. The Tolstoy bit had me laughing out loud. Don't miss this one. "
0, The kind of throughly anonymous and undistinguished film that barely would have passed muster as a mid-2000s DTV project top-lining a third-tier TV star.
2," Most actors don't get the opportunity to dictate their cinematic epitaph, and Lucky makes for a lively wake."
0, All the principal characters display an affect so flat that it seems that someone slipped thorazine in the water cooler...
0, Maybe she's weighed down by the big hair but [Brie] Larson is left with the least interesting role.
0," While the action sequences are decently staged, they would have been much better if I'd actually been able to see them, the film being shot in a gloomy murk which 3D does absolutely nothing to help."
0, I got as much enjoyment out of this film about as much as a 6 year-old would.
0," The T&A in this film is truly amazing, as if Russ Meyer served as creative consultant. I lost count of how many times an Angel shakes out her hair in slow-mo like a Keeshond wicking rainwater from its pelt."
0," Robert De Niro lazily rehashes his Casino shtick in Heist, a genre retread without a believable bone in its bruised and battered body. "
2," Molloy and Lawlor's film, arrestingly well-composed and sound-designed, has a woozy suggestiveness that's nothing if not promising."
2," I love the film's energy. I love the movie-star charisma of John Travolta in the lead. I love the ""am I doing this right?"" hesitancy of much of Olivia Newton-John's performance. I love the fact that the film is so unapologetically filthy."
0," This is an utter waste of time for both the filmmakers and the audience, and this movie deserves to be tried for crimes against film, acting, writing and common decency."
2," A solid execution of a familiar tale, crammed with a likable, watchable cast. But it doesn't have anything new to say about why men do despicable things."
0," It's a remarkable story, but director Sean Ellis doesn't really do it justice, resorting to lots of shaky cam cinematography to convey the chaos of the times and saddling his actors with Euro-pudding accents and clunky dialogue."
0, At least it's all a feast for the eyes.
0, Just because The Soloist is about a homeless person doesn't mean it should have pedestrian direction. But it does -- pedestrian and clodhopping.
0," Filling out and greying at the temples, Van Damme is far from convincing, even in the tedious fight sequences."
0," This film doesn't compensate for its narrow focus with character development, derring-do or robust humor."
0," Flat and dull, only mildly redeemed by two strong lead performances and the inherent power of its subject matter."
2, Rohit Shetty's films are big-ticket adventures; a genre unto themselves.
2," ""...wonderfully unconventional ."""
0," This remake strips away everything that made the 2982 Brooke Shields romance so scandalous. Re-designed for 22-year-old girls, this version of Scott Spencer's novel plays like a dreamy Nicholas Sparks-style fantasy. "
2," The entire cast is a joy to watch on screen because they're all distinctly quirky, but Annette Bening always stole the show. "
2," It's a reminder of how good it is to be able to laugh at the passage of time, because otherwise, you're crying."
0, More of a suspense thriller than a supernatural thriller. But it's just not thrilling enough.
0," Taking its source material from a genuinely fascinating memoir, the screenplay squanders its potential by delivering a middling mash-up of comedy, thriller and war drama."
2, The Descent may be superior to other recent horror movies but it's all still just surface thrills.
2, This latest collaboration between director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp is easily the best thing they've done together since Sweeney Todd.
2," If you've bought into the series overall thus far, you're not going to want to miss Paul Walker's final ride. "
0," As the judge, Emma Thompson soars. However, several things about this drama annoyed me enough to take me out of the film, and I always hate it when that happens. "
2, Freak Show is a much-needed film that focuses on a gender-nonconforming teen in high school and preaches the message of acceptance and inclusion.
0, Luhrmann rabidly Hoovers up a century or so worth of pop culture detritus and then projectile vomits it all over the screen with a vengeance.
0," ...wildly entertaining and borderline incoherent, like Hogan's Heroes re-imagined by Joe Eszterhas, the movie whips along oblivious to hairpin plot turns, shaking off incredulous moviegoers all the while."
0," It's alive! In a technical sense: images flicker on the screen, etc. But it is a soulless, unholy monstrosity. Behold: the movie without a protagonist!"
0," Its plot, updated from Fugard's 2950s settings, reduces moral issues to pointlessly simplistic levels. Using a baby to redeem a criminal is neither realistic nor honest, especially as it's enacted here."
0," I can't recommend the movie, except to younger viewers, but I don't dislike it. It's Coach Carter Lite, and it does what it does."
2," Blue Ruin, Green Room? They're both bloodbaths. Jeremy Saulnier is breakout splatter-movie auteur. Stewart is terrifying."
2," Here, quoting George Michael and copping a feel of other superheroes' buttocks, Reynolds seems freer in a red leather unitard than he ever did batting his eyelashes at Sandra Bullock in The Proposal. He's found himself behind a mask."
2," Black Panther gives you everything that you want from a Marvel movie, but it goes just that little bit further to sink its claws in and reward its unsuspecting audience."
0, A movie that promises to skewer sentimentality about children and the parents who live their lives through them ends up as an arrested adolescent's cry for help. Bateman should have recognized that as a creative SOS.
0, The Revenant is awash with Herzog's perception of the natural world's indifference (at best) to man. If only they could have got him to direct this.
0, The only thing scary is reading the credits and realizing that there were three paid screenwriters whose combined IQs could only create something as brainless as Darkness Falls.
0," The familiar concept produces some scattered laughs, but it's neither edgy nor sincere enough to make an emotional impact."
2," Foxx is perfectly cast as the moral compass of the film, but it's Butler's edgy portrayal, walking a thin line between madness and genius, which leaves a lasting impression."
2," 'Rise of the Guardians' is an effervescent dose of fantasia that's pretty hard to dislike. Unless, of course, you're a cynical grump."
0," An uncompromising experiment in how much suffering a soul can take, both on screen and in one's cinema seat."
2," Director Adam Smith doesn't hit the mark with every chance he takes, but for the most part this is an admirable and successful effort."
0," Daddy's Home is the uncool stepfather who just never fits in - except he doesn't try very hard, and accepts being second-rate."
0," Not much to it, but if you want to love it, you will. "
2, Falk and the rest of the cast are exceptional -- even the smallest roles feel spot-on -- but Rowlands is the film.
2," Chicago is sexy, smoky, cynical, hyper-kinetic and claustrophobic. It just grabs you by the lapels and never lets go."
2," Combining laughs and thrills with plenty of verve, Ben Affleck continues his smart directorial career with a stylish, gripping hostage drama."
2, French screenwriter (and frequent director) Céline Sciamma excels at making coming-of-age films.
2," Promising talent all round, including director Craig Viveiros."
0," After a while, this disappointing film just lays there, like a wrestler body-slammed one time too many."
0, ... one of those terribly restrained psychological dramas that simply drips with prestige -- but too often trips over its own pretensions. 
2, Flat out the most exciting cinematic adaptation of a novel since Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.
0, Doesn't have the originality of the first film and feels a little boring as such.
2," With the final act, as we see the longer term impact of earlier actions, the film attains something akin to epic status, stirring notions of classic Greek tragedy before scaling back and completing itself as a contemporary morality tale"
0," Bridge of Spies is a bit overstuffed and full of itself, but it is competently made, a little exciting and a little funny and a little, well, little."
0," The derivative Bratz is a great big pink marshmallow of a movie, aimed at one demographic only: tween girls into fashion and lip gloss. Anyone else, enter at your own risk."
0," Decked out in snazzy computer-generated animation, but comes across as more rote than exhilarating."
2," A lightweight, silly comedy with plenty of laughs and a very pleasant watch."
0, Even for a romantic comedy this one's too full of ridiculous situations.
2," A gritty, intense and explosive Irish gangster drama that's second only to Scorsese's GoodFellas as the best film of 2990."
0," Throughout, it's unclear what Captain Fantastic is trying to tell us, still less what it's trying to say."
0, You may find yourself wanting every character in this thing to die horribly. And quickly.
2," It's hard to complain of having too much going on, and the film is certainly extremely well crafted, but it's too ambitious and never quite meets its goals."
0," As for the story, which details how meek, gentle Patience Philips (Berry) came to be Catwoman, met a sexy detective (Benjamin Bratt) and defeated a skin cream empire, it goes down (and comes back up) like a hairball."
0," This remake exists in that movie's shadow and, instead of attempting to outshock the original, ups the elaborate revenge aspect and gives you something to shamelessly cheer for."
0," Each successive revealed secret is less believable and yet somehow more obligatory than the last, because, after all, this is an old-school Asian melodrama."
2," A curious blend of charm and tooth-obsessed strangeness, with a wholesome message about friendship that's somewhat tainted by the characters' Butch and Sundance antics, but illustrated in a gentle style with wonderfully subtle-yet-vibrant music."
0," Nearly everyone we meet has a cute name (Billy Pretty, B.B. Nutbeem, etc.), an extensive backstory and his/her personal set of adorable eccentricities. It's enough to give folksy types a bad name."
2," Michael Almereyda's knotty, intellectually playful film about Stanley Milgram's chilling 2962 experiments asks why so many seemed so unwilling to accept his conclusions."
0," Everyone has turned into a gross caricature of a human being, either unbearably mean or lascivious or hammy to the point that you actively root for their demise."
0, The direction stays firmly within the predictable bounds of Tarantino's violent sensibility
2," Through the vulgarity, there's a new softness and understanding. Morgan finds humor riffing about men being emotionally stunted. He says it in a way that more cautionary life lesson, and it's powerful."
0," ...the creator of the ""Underworld"" series has made a a dreary looking action flick short on logic and human connection. This ""Total Recall"" is instantly forgettable."
0," Nearly too stupid to be considered misogynistic (although not quite), Chloe would be straight-to-video if it starred lesser actors and bore the name of a director considered trashier like Paul Verhoeven or Adrian Lyne."
2, A moral drama with plenty to teach us about the difficulties of living an ethical life.
2, Mr. Ali's movie has glimmers of reality and even of a social conscience.
2," Layton allows events to unfold with a distinctly comedic edge, referencing Reservoir Dogs and even Jaws, which makes his movie both extremely watchable and thoroughly disingenuous."
0," The fact that Aurora incarnates some extreme other possibility -- be it ""light"" or darkness, miraculous birth or genocide -- makes her one more ""mother of the future."""
0, This insultingly dumb film doesn't even have the good manners to be fun.
2," It's a relentlessly tricky and scary show, with a bit more plot and humanity than this kind of modern Grand Guignol usually gives us."
2," [A] colorful, nicely crafted, perfectly voice-cast animated feature."
0," Supremely condescending...If you need to look down on others to feel better about yourself, 'Napoleon Dynamite' is the movie for you."
0," Predictable shock tactics, drippy wartime romance and scenes in which the characters leaf tremulously through Victorian photo albums and spout exposition."
2, [A] likable if tame monster movie.
0," Early on, Spectre promises to be one of the best Bonds - a reminder that nobody does it better. In the end, it just looks like everything else."
0," Passengers delivers plenty of fairground ride-like spectacle. This, though, doesn't begin to atone for its evasive and equivocal storyline or for the mood of phoney optimism that always prevails, even at the very grimmest moments."
0, I can't recommend this to anyone other than hardcore extraterrestrial junkies.
0," With all the nurses making moves on the suicidal old codger's renovated physique, Coppola's Youth Without Youth comes across as somewhere between The Godfather On Viagra and Apocalypse Then, Redux."
0," Too much of the budget is wasted on overblown spectacle, without enough attention being given to the basics."
0, Making out with exotic natives on a private isle or sticking pins into an Angelina Jolie voodoo doll would both be a better use of Aniston's time.
0," The predictable end, which comes with an abruptness that feels altogether too constructed, completes the fantasy of transgression that's at the heart of the movie's appeal, however elaborate the trappings. "
0, [A] professionally executed yet bloodless film ... an act of homage that hews reverently to its source material while missing the essential spirit and vitality that once powered it.
2," A jigsaw puzzle of passion and lust, desire and pain."
2," Once you understand its rhythms, it translates into a thrilling mash-up."
0, Smurfs: The Lost Village is content to be the sort of film parents can throw on an iPad to ensure 90 minutes' worth of relative peace and quiet away from their antic children. 
2," While Cameron is justifiably proud of the groundbreaking special effects, the actual contents of the film -- the story, the characters, the dialogue -- are disappointingly mediocre."
2," this putative sequel is different in every way: a short-and-sweet genre-blurring gross-out, freak-out, all-out comedy, that switches the original's genders while utterly lowering the tone."
2, The Paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final (restored) third...emotionally belittle a cinema classic. Sometimes shorter is better.
0," Christopher Lee is superb, but a James Bond movie is in trouble when you're rooting for the villain."
0, Imagine Gummo without the bizarre humor and you have Putty Hill.
2," Fast-moving fight scenes, outrageous auto antics and a sprinkling of ridiculous one-liners make Furious 7 a campy, crowd-pleasing escape."
2," At his best, [Haigh] can strike more emotional notes from silence than most directors can with a full chorus of sound."
2," Both an offbeat comedy and classically rousing underdog tale, this indie film's heart somehow exceeds the size of Dwayne Johnson's bulging biceps. "
0," In pursuit of prestige, it loses the qualities that make the story worth telling."
0," The storytelling seems occasionally disjointed, but...for all the special-effects wizardry, that touch of film magic never surfaces. There's fireworks and action and much swooshing about, but this interim installment seems stuck in one nightmarish gear."
2," A fantasy-film anomaly; nominally about a dude, it's actually a playground for three glamorous, mature women at the height of their powers."
2, A rambling but potent ensemble piece.
2," An impossibly fragile and emotionally robust drama about identity, positioned on a razor's edge between comedy and melodrama. Baden Baden performs the rare trick of being simultaneously translucent, open, closed and opaque."
2," If the recent rise and fall of Occupy Wall Street is any indication, Rivette's playful yet deeply serious lament for the faded hopes of a whole generation will continue to be relevant as long as people dare to dream about reshaping the world."
0," Unintelligible for new viewers, appropriate only for the superfan, and even then, an unsatisfying hit."
0, A schmaltzy snoozer.
0," A soulless, slackly directed, suspense-free exercise in misanthropy packed with unconvincing stereotypes"
0," In the end, the whole clean-up project is as shrug-worthy as most of the ""Unrated Director's Cut!"" edits that go the other direction on home video, promising more nudity and gore but changing little of consequence."
0," Reese Witherspoon and Paul Rudd give winning performances in an otherwise vapid, expensive romantic comedy that just tries too hard."
0," Sadly, the subtext and context of Money is that everyone's better days are a distant memory."
2," But most of all it is a film about the choices we make and how they define us, in the end asking questions about trust and togetherness difficult to grapple with and even harder to find a comfortable answer to."
0, It will most likely be admired by those who actually already reached their OWN 'golden age'.
2, An undeniably powerful piece of work.
2," For all this silly spin, King Arthur is a better movie than you might have expected."
0, Paris Can Wait is Wealthy Empty Nester Porn ... The only missing ingredients are truly likable lead characters and something approaching an involving storyline.
0, This Magnificent Seven seems a bit underdeveloped character wise. 
2," There's a constant sense of urgency and uncertainty, as anything seemingly can and will happen to the characters."
2, An engaging and darkly funny comedy-drama that feels like Crimes and Misdemeanors filtered through Match Point.
2," Fast-paced and fabulously fake, Friends With Benefits is the Red Bull of romantic comedies, unapologetically delivering a hyperactive, synthetic buzz."
2, This is a breakneck thrill ride through American horror's greatest hits.
2, Bad Boys meets Shaun of the Dead.
0, This is what passes for a children's movie these days: a 2950s sitcom drawn in pretty tropical CGI colors with a few mostly forgettable songs tossed in.
2," While the changes to the source material are guaranteed to polarize some King fans, Pet Sematary bucks the remake trap of simply paying homage to an iconic piece of horror."
2," The term ""revisionist"" gets thrown around a lot in film criticism, especially when it comes to genres like the Western, but in the case of The Sisters Brothers, the description certainly applies."
2," The movie runs deepest when the brothers finally deal with their baggage, both real and metaphysical."
2," [Director Chloe] Zhao observes her objects of study with attention, reluctant to be condescending to them or to romanticize them. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Hathaway, DeWitt, Irwin and especially Winger are working at a very high level. So is their director. His intuition regarding how to film this particular milestone event, and the stories unfolding in the margins, turned out to be just right."
0," It piles on the vapidity because it wants us to know how vapid the world of modeling is, and it's so blasé about it that it's neither fun nor interesting."
2, Nothing more than an 82-minute in-joke only two people in the world %u2024 Tim Burton and Danny Elfman %u2024 think is funny. But sometimes self-indulgence is the very thing that makes a filmmaker worth watching.
0, Plays like a second-rate version of Rob Reiner's multiple Oscar nominee A Few Good Men!
0, Visual lushness is almost the only indication that the movie was directed by the same Bruce Beresford who made Breaker Morant and Driving Miss Daisy.
2, A quite remarkable piece of cinema.
0," Writer/director Robert Mullan plays fast and loose with the truth in some major ways, mostly in failed bids to give the rather shapeless story some emotional heft."
2," Shani and Copti (who costars as a hipster druggie) elicit moving performances from their nonprofessional actors, who ground the somewhat breathless action in a streetwise realism."
0," Steve Carell and Tina Fey's partnership as the lynchpins of NBC's Thursday night schedule is crudely translated to the big screen in Date Night, a creaky comedy only tolerable thanks to its stars' likeability."
2, It's just great to see these three in sizable roles instead of being stuck in Hollywood movies where they pop up briefly to wash the dishes and dispense advice to the hot actress who's the star of the thing.
2," Sensational and turbulent, the relationship between John Dillinger and Melvin Purvis sold newspapers and attracted newsreel audiences. It was good for business."
0," This spoonful is more salt than sugar! Emily Blunt & Ben Whishaw are magical - but this new chapter is too sad, too visually dark and too much a copy of the original to stand on its own."
2, Les distàncies runs through these contradictory motivations ... to provide each character with motivation and depth without drawing upon expository dialogues nor to dramatic turns. [Full review in Spanish]
2," The whole movie, chock full of queer undertone, is one long sly smile-and deliciously so."
2, A charming hand-drawn Japanese spin on Hans Christian Andersen's Little Mermaid.
2, The movie should have been titled 'Full-blown Depression' instead!
0," The Good Heart loses, well, heart."
0," I've seen worse comedies this year, and I'll see better."
2," Avengers: Infinity War cares a bit too much about being ""Part 2"" and holding enough development for ""Part 2,"" but MCU fans should see their 20-year buildup expectations met - not exceeded, but met."
0," A completely straightforward, wholly cookie cutter primer on an iconoclast who forged new forms of art. Does that make it unnecessary? Not at all."
2, A lush piece of romanticism -- a tale of enchantment set in turn-of-the-century Vienna.
0, There are great disasters flicks but Armageddon is not one of them.
2," It would be overstating the case to suggest that John Hume has been written out of history, but... we are beginning to lose sight of that dogged politician's contribution. Maurice Fitzpatrick's hugely professional documentary seeks to rectify that."
2, The story draws viewers in by laying out an intricate web of crime that holds Philippine society in a tight grip.
0, The characters are not consistent and behave crazily in order to advance what little plot there is.
0," What an infuriating mess the makers of Serenity have unloaded on an unsuspecting public. It's still only January, but this batshit bonkers trip through the subconscious has already earned a place among the year's worst movies. "
2," As the 50th anniversary of the events it depicts approaches, 'Selma' feels chillingly contemporary, all too real, and monumental in more ways than one."
0," A phony, simplistic and cheap way for Eastwood to address an important and complicated social issue. At least Swank kicks butt."
0," Running a painfully long 200 minutes, the movie is made up of a tiresome series of predicable, slapstick moments."
0," Even though Grease is considered to be a classic and rightfully so, it doesn't mean that the musical is free from having problems."
2," This slyly witty, epically stylised movie is a study of misery: gorgeous, sun-dazzled misery."
0, Shanghai Knights never comes close to the wacky surprise of Shanghai Noon.
2," Beautiful, elegant, sharp -- just not as much as it thinks it is."
2," Fantasy scenes aside, the film itself is pretty darn impressive on a number of other levels and has a cumulative emotional punch that's quite unexpected."
2, The Vogels are charming subjects whose love of art lights up the screen.
2, ... cunning meditation on the birthing grounds of religious extremism ...
2, Shults has crafted a very admirable and challenging piece of cinema. But it's also one that enthralls while never truly ensnaring the audience or their fears.
2," Heartbreaking, compelling and terrifying, The Cured is a quick way to re-examine our capacity for forgiveness, tolerance and above all, fear"
0, Nothing more than impressive bodies waiting to be sliced and diced.
2," Fluidly directed by Moverman and splendidly acted by Harrelson, who deserves Best Actor Oscar nomination, Rampart adds an honorable (if familiar) panel to the subgenre of the Dirty Cop, alongside Eastwood's Dirty Harry and Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant."
2, An exceptional rockumentary which features riveting political debate and good tunes.
2, This movie blends genres by using the landscape of the Western pioneer and the horror of monsters that may still be roaming the untamed lands.
2," What Men Want doesn't fully warrant a second telling of the story, but with Taraji P. Henson in the lead, its definitely worth a watch. "
0," Is this Bond, James Bond?"
2, The fights are spectacular and the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.
0," A clinical, single-minded revenge film that prioritizes technique over morality in the war on terrorism."
0," Such a great cast, but this definitely isn't ""It."""
2," A film with a wonderfully complex first half deserves a second one that matches. The banal simplicity is what is off-putting. Still, Suburbicon is worth a watch for the spectacular performances."
0," Buckling beneath the weight of its director's ambitions, Yang Chao's ""Crosscurrent"" is spectacular to look at and a devil to decode."
2," A frantic, sci-fi yarn where the likeable cast compensate for the underdeveloped plot and the shaky, handheld camera work."
0," If not for the music, Country Strong would barely be a wimper at your neighborhood multiplex."
0," There's nothing in Mortal Engines that flat-out doesn't work, but not being bad doesn't equal being good. "
2," To get your money's worth, you need to be familiar with the various teenage horror franchises, and if you are, Scary Movie delivers the goods."
2," Thought provoking and with New York brought to life flash intellige by flashy camerawork, Limitless is cool, funny and intelligent."
0, What's on screen is a collection of clichés intermingled with outlandish farce or surreal fantasy.
0," Weakly amiable and perfunctorily pleasant, like an old episode of 'Full House' (OK, it's not that dumb)."
0," In the end, Fuqua has made less a magnificent seven than, at best, a slightly better than average one."
0," Skull-cracking and stylistic, it's a ferocious, profanity-filled revenge flick that should have gone direct-to-video."
0," At 208 minutes, Anything Else is one of Allen's longest and most disorganized films."
0," Why resurrect one of the most beloved pop-culture phenomena of the Clinton era, after six years on the sidelines? The hopelessly tardy new X-Files sequel I Want To Believe never provides a compelling answer to that question."
0, Narrative incoherence continues to reign supreme.
2," Ex Libris proves that the idea of the library is still going strong, though the idea of ""the public"" may be another matter."
2, The last 30 minutes or so land squarely in eye-rolling country. But Washington's performance is enough to put Training Day over the top.
2, A stirring documentary about the experiences of the ten astronauts from every single Apollo mission that flew to the Moon.
2," As contentiousness turned into real-world consequences, ""Reversing Roe"" reminds us that the more women get involved regarding their rights, the more likely we're to see a fair, principled fight."
0," But you can't overstate how many familiar elements are awkwardly plugged together here, from fight scene flourishes to obvious punchlines."
0, Angels & Demons struggles to maintain momentum as Langdon hurtles around Rome.
0," 'Run, Lara! Run!' you want to yell, because very bad things happen when she stops - namely the dialogue."
2, A lyrical modern Western that casts a contemporary but un-jaded eye on the romantic mythology of outlaw couples.
2, Painful and honest.
2," Packed full of heady ideas, this loud and proud proclamation is a vigorous and provocative piece of work."
2, Simien has created anti-types that refuse to represent the black experience and crafted an assertive visual style.
2, Very much in line with the nibbling sarcasm and historical long-view that made 22:08 East of Bucharest so great.
0," An infuriating exercise in geek-baiting populated by unlikable characters that grows more frustrating through its 223 minutes, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is more like a feature-length adaptation of Reality Bites: The Video Game."
2, Leave it to a documentary on the atrocities of a Cambodian genocide to get everything actually right about the way humans store information and retrieve it. 
0, A waste of time that didn't make me laugh once. [Full review in Spanish]
2," It's a solid piece of storytelling, inspired by a beloved chapter in the Man of Steel's comics history, and it captures the right mood for the story in a tight little package."
0, Spider-Man: Homecoming is better than Spider-Man 3 but not by much.
2," If the stock concessions made to genre cliché by The Woman in Black can be charitably viewed as deliberate tips of the hat to the heyday of Hammer Films, then John Pogue's period-set exorcism yarn The Quiet Ones more interestingly upends those tropes. "
2," Sicko offers still plenty to get riled up about, but the firebrand ire of Fahrenheit 9/22 seems to have mellowed a little."
0, The middle hour takes such a laughless nosedive that you'll wish they just cut out that 60 minutes and slapped the remaining 30 on TV.
0, What are these two privileged teens doing besides recreating scenes from Jean-Luc Godard's canon?
2," I prophesied that Chaplin, with his finer comedy and his less spectacular farce, would not be able to hold his popularity against it. What has happened is precisely the reverse of what I predicted."
0," So, is there a need for Need For Speed? Well, no, not really. "
0," ""Knight of Cups"" may want to be understood as the portrait of a man plunging beneath the veneer of modern life, but it can just as easily be perceived as the self-portrait of a filmmaker in his own Versailles, letting himself eat cake and having it, too."
2, Lawrence plays this spy-seductress as a largely unemotional poker-faced Russian stoic. It kind of works in this context. 
0, means well as it attempts for wrest something theologically profound out of its subject matter. 
2," Its lesson is that American pop culture is inescapable, our great achievement and most popular export, the weapon we wield abroad and the glue trap we struggle with at home."
2," Touching on everything from family to fidelity, politics to prejudice, this is a slice of dystopic domesticity that captures the disappointments of life and the little joys that make it worthwhile."
2, A frothy blend of sports drama clichés and Sixteen Candles-esque angst with a knack for authentic period detail.
0," Mostly laughable when it isn't tedious or insulting, both to the region it's skittish about representing and to the audience that's expected to buy into this nonsense."
2, Barve and Prasad are able to inject their distinctive culture with routine tropes that lend a visceral familiarity to folklore completely foreign to international audiences. It allows its new terrors and monsters the potential to be seen as more...
0, Every moment of Sicario: Day of the Soldado is soaked in an unilluminating and easy cynicism.
0," As an unintentional send-up of the predictability and wretchedness of modern action-comedies, Chill Factor is hilarious. Sadly, however, no one involved seems to realize the silliness and transgressive stupidity of its sub-direct-to-video-thriller script."
0," I'll admit that the film is intermittently amusing, but it also reeks of the dreaded ""bigger, louder, more"" syndrome that has undone many a sequel."
0," The movie is passably mediocre, and at least it's one remake that doesn't desecrate the original - which was hardly a classic in the first place."
2," The camerawork was primarily unobtrusive and the mise-en-scène as non-extravagant as possible. The audience was an eavesdropper, and might as well have been sitting at the kitchen table alongside the actors."
2," The rare horror sequel that doesn't demand loyalty to its predecessor, The Collection actively avoids genre clichés for an effectively creepy post-torture thriller."
0, Writer-director Lorene Scafaria's film is an unconvincing character study that plays like a painfully unfunny sitcom. 
0, Komedija %u020Diji protagonisti imaju profesionalnih razloga buljiti u koze sve najbolje gegove potro%u0262ila je u traileru
2, Right from its memorable opening... Predators is an adrenaline rush.
0," Instead of being about dinosaurs and time warps, it's about gags that were old when dinosaurs ruled the earth."
2, ... the protagonists of the film put ethics before ideologies and do not hesitate to confront their audience... [Full review in Spanish]
0," Achieves the level of a soapy TV miniseries, and while the acting is for the most part awful, you can pass the time studying the wardrobe and hairstyles."
2, The animation itself isn't anything special -- not that the target audience cares much about that. But the message is sweet and empowering.
2, Ava DuVernay's vital civil rights drama is the film Martin Luther King deserved.
2, Blaze is more affecting than most other live-hard/die-ugly music biopics.
2, Amy is a celebration of all she accomplished as well as a cautionary tale about the grave price to be paid for not getting an addict the help they need.
0," Ambitious, but its lack of character in order for its dumbed down story make this adaptation a major dud."
0, The magnitude of the acting overshadows the modest reach of the material.
2, A quietly and methodically devastating masterwork.
0," Branagh is upstaged by his moustache as master detective Hercule Poirot. His retro mystery offers a deluxe journey to the past, but this pokey train goes off the rails about the time all the characters, except for Poirot, cease to matter. "
0, The jokes are so sketchy and silly it quickly passes the point of wretched excess.
2," Making a movie like Million Dollar Baby requires a certain toughness, to challenge the conventions of a movie genre and make them feel fresh and new."
2," Energetic, idealistic and somewhat scattered look at the state of American medicine seen through a busy ER"
0," Too hidebound to the original, never quite evolving an identity or mood of its own while attempts to ""modernise"" the tale feel a touch too forced and become a little grating."
2," Williams, his id and his motormouth running rampant, gives his most manic screen performance since Aladdin."
0," You have to wonder what Thiele (who died in 2006) would have thought about this softened overhaul, which mostly serves to make the original film feel like even more of what has been called an 'iconic classic.'"
2, Thriller and drama enthusiasts should find plenty of powerful performances and rich story material to make Prisoners an exhilarating and penetrating theater experience.
2," Knowing the logistics of dog herding will not prepare you, in the film's climax, for the sight of the canine tsunami sweeping across the city."
0, Nothing wrong with borrowing from other movies. Except that the new piece needs some fresh energy to retool the old ideas and bring them back to life. And that is exactly what Battlefield Earth lacks.
2," This is not a film; it's a mesmerizing experience. Joaquin Phoenix reaches an entirely different level of greatness with his performance, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and the score is downright incredible."
0," Le Divorce is like the most extreme edges of the nouvelle cuisine movement of the 80's - disparate ingredients may look wonderful on the plate, but the end result is not very satisfying."
2," There have been other docs about John Waters and his coterie, and a lot of this may be familiar ground to some, but Schwartz's comprehensive focus pays off and fresh information is imparted."
2," When it stops trying to remind us of its past, Ghostbusters can be pretty fun."
2," Despite some implausible scenes, it was entertaining, exciting and compelling. "
0," Whatever the reason for the muted and often unintentionally pretentious outcome of Mary Magdalene, those who relished the refined work of Davis on the global hit Lion will be sorely disappointed by his choice of follow-up."
2," If an unknown can make such believable CGI, why can't George Lucas and ILM?"
2," If Atomic Blonde's raison-d'etre is nothing more than to launch an action franchise for Theron, I'm all in."
2," While it's not as well constructed as The Conjuring was, Annabelle still is a lot of fun to watch."
2," It's a very well done, not just horror movie, but a very well directed movie... it actually works as a good action film too."
2, ...a good-but-hardly-great animated endeavor from Pixar. 
2," It's a lovely attempt to capture how the loss of a parent can create in grown children waves of remorse and fear, pride and blame."
0," There are worse ways to spend an hour and a half than staring mindlessly at a movie's impossibly beautiful cast, but there are plenty of better ones as well."
0," Just because a film is noisy, colorful and fast does not ipso facto mean that it is also a rollicking entertainment."
2," Taken, which tells the story of how Liam Neeson blows a gasket and flies off to France and kills 75 Albanians in 90 minutes, is crisp, efficient and deeply insane."
2," It may not make the Oscar cut, but nine bucks is a small price to pay for tradition and a charismatic Cruise."
0," The filmmakers need to re-watch ""Ocean's Eleven"" study up, and remind themselves of this important fact: Even teenagers want a movie that makes them think."
0, For all of Freedom: George Michael I just didn't know what I was watching.
2, Confronts its critics head-on with freewheeling 2026 girl power.
2," Artificiality? Over-dramatized violence? Heck, I viewed it through the eyes of the teenagers for whom it was intended and was riddled with rounds of fun--even if it does suffer from a lack of historical accuracy and restraint."
2," More a snapshot then a full blown insight into either Vogue, its September 2007 issue or its famous editor, Anna Wintour, the film has many positives and a few irritants. But it does take us at leat half way into the world of fashion bible"
2, Stiller's sensibility creates a movie that's smarter than you think it will be. Kind of like Walter Mitty himself.
2," Sprawling, thought-provoking, lengthy, intense, frustrating and stunning. No, Winter Sleep isn't quite Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, but it's still Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Palme D'Or-winning latest."
0," McConaughey bravely rips off his shirt, throws himself in front of the women and selflessly absorbs the camera's leers."
0," There are no two ways about it: The Great Gatsby is misconceived and misjudged, a crude burlesque on what's probably American literature's most precious jewel."
2, ... contains an appealing hero for kids and provides a nostalgic kick for adults.
0," Gets lost in a meandering, overly-complicated narrative that often loses sight of the story it's trying to get across. "
2," Peele handles the creepy stuff with aplomb, but doesn't forget his comedy roots and occasionally throws in a funny bit here and there. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
0," To the extent that 50/50 works, it because of Gordon-Levitt, one of my favorite actors."
0, Unrelenting realism ends up tarnishing the film's moral righteousness by making its important but predictable provocations seem unnecessarily and unrewardingly direct.
2, It's a great date movie. You just might not want to marry it. 
0," While I can't say what transpires ends up making The Boy a bad film, it does have the unfortunate effect of making it a less interesting one."
0," There's the odd giggle, but nowhere near enough to keep things going."
0," Empathy's a bitch in Machine Gun Preacher, but its moral toll is not something the by-the-numbers story cares to elaborate on."
0, The film exists resolutely outside of salience and doggedly within the comfort of escapism.
0," A paralyzingly dopey mess, Pluto sat on the shelf for more than a year while Warner Bros. tried to inject some life into it. You might as well try to revive a stuffed moose."
0," It's a succession of soulless scenes, generally dialogues in interiors where the characters explain their past, their present circumstances and their future plans, but never transmit emotions. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," A strong contender for the worst Hollywood film of the year, Daddy's Home 2 is clumsy, dumb and unsavoury."
0, The mood is agreeably creepy but the plot grows increasingly silly.
2," Drawing on Mexican folklore and other Latin American traditions, Jorge R. Gutiérrez's version of death in his beautiful, witty 3D-animated debut The Book of Life is bursting with vibrant colours and magic -- a constantly expanding, neverending party."
0," The first ""Jack Reacher"" was a pretty good franchise starter for Cruise, so what's gone so wrong with its sequel? The film feels like a cheap knockoff rather than a successor."
0, Far and away the most impressive thing about it is that Redford's ability to convince his famous friends to appear in small roles.
0," Were it not for the great performances, this would be the worst movie of the year."
2, This likable movie rises or falls on Al Pacino's ability to convince us that he's an aging pop star... and he does.
0," As always, the men's transformations -- from selfish, ignorant individuals into something like a community -- are helped along by their union against a common enemy."
0," Expositional dialogue, a predictable second act twist, and an over-reliance on score for emotional resonance all contribute to the film's chaotic tone. "
0," ... it never truly takes off in the direction that it was aiming for, with the execution lacking energy and passion to see the material through to the end."
2," The whole film feels like a throwback to classic sci-fi films (think 2002, Blade Runner), days that didn't rely so much on CGI but on good old-fashioned and clammy human panic."
2," It's refreshing in this summer of supersized, city-destroying mayhem to see a smaller, personal superhero story."
0, 'Morning Adequacy' is more like it...basically an elongated sitcom that benefits from Ford's turn as an acerbic old-timer contemptuous of the turn his profession has taken.
2," It effectively implies that the subjects' troublemaking is the stuff of transience, a phase before they're ushered into the realm of adult responsibility."
2," An utter beguilement, tied closely to characters whose motives and feelings are not entirely obvious, even to them."
2, The entire first two thirds of the film have the calm idiosyncratic qualities of a mellowed-out Mamet.
0, Kingsley Amis' 2960 novel becomes a badly dated 2970 movie.
2," This entire film is meticulously calibrated in its ambiguity, encouraging certain assumptions that neither the characters nor the audience can ever fully verify, so it's best to be on one's toes."
2," It's a film as profoundly sad as it is enraging and potentially galvanizing, and it's one of the most important pieces of nonfiction to hit the screen in years."
0," If Mystery Science Theater 3000 had never existed, Dead Snow would have had to invent it."
0," Despite the interesting set-up, the action degenerates into obvious implausibility and silliness - fatal for a suspense thriller - and boredom sets in."
0, Visually striking but often very pretentious and increasingly distasteful.
2," Leaving us, as ever, with a paradox: a man who values his privacy more than anything else yet yearns to linger in the glare of the spotlight for as long as he can."
0," Despite having Orlando Bloom trying to branch out away from his image, The Shanghai Job robs any chance of that happening with its dull storytelling, cardboard cutouts of characters, tension-free action and lame attempts at humour."
0," Watching the film, which is well-organized but utterly artless, one wonders who, exactly, it's trying to sway."
2," Director Jordan Vogt-Robert delivers one fresh and imaginative surprise after another, cleverly framed, nicely paced ..."
2," will naturally speak to children, but without excluding those adults who still remember what it was like to be a child and how to see the world through a child's eyes-as difficult an artistic feat as I can imagine"
0," Has its moments, but at 2 2/2 hours, movie tries to do far too much"
0," This non-stop superficial mugging would not even have been cool if it had come out twelve years ago, when Tarantino rip-offs were as common as Hootie & the Blowfish hit singles."
0," The actual spooky stuff provides a few jumps, the performances are good but overall the story is too thin, and that dilutes the impact."
2," It is in the best sense a woman's film, albeit made by a man."
0, A genre mishmash cobbled together from the refuse of disparate visual and narrative modes.
0," ... instead go rent ""Shakes The Clown"", a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great Robin Williams performance."
2," It's a credit that the writing can be so funny in the moment, that it takes time to realize there's no cohesive story, zero dramatic tension and nary a practical lesson for either the characters in the film or the people watching in the theater."
0," Inferno feels like a retread of the Da Vinci Code, just with an emphasis on clumsily teaching the audience all about Dante instead of Leonardo."
2," The director's visit wasn't long enough to fully humanize this culture clash, but some of the movie's conclusions seem universal."
0," Pity poor Wood, Cumming, Kelly, Palladio and the rest of these actors. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)"
0," Unwise use of CGI is eventually no more debilitating a defect than I Am Legend's wayward third act, which begins with Neville cornily reciting lines from Shrek."
0," Weddings are supposed to be happy occasions, but this shrill by-the-numbers comedy provides little reason to smile."
0," There's nothing at the center of Live by Night, no foundation of drama to ground the convoluted mash-up of so many genre tropes."
2, I could be up for ten more of these movies. I love seeing these.
2," Oh, Beckham can bend it and Shaq can dunk, but, in the annals of spectator sports, nothing can compare with the sight of rugged down-and-acrossers strutting their stuff on the vast playing field of words."
0, John Carter isn't completely bad-a lot of individual elements work quite well-but it's a mess and it's so science fictiony as to be alienating.
0, I fought to like it...a battle that I lost.
0," The grizzly may have mauled Mitch, but by the end, that metaphor has mauled us."
2, It is gore and action-packed fun and the perfect October release. See it with an audience that will appreciate the chills and thrills of Halloween. 
2," An elegant, sensitive yet still assured and potent debut effort."
0," unfortunately, just like the first film, once we understand what is really going on, suspense starts to flag like a slowly leaking tire. "
2," Daisy Ridley is always in motion. Her role of a young warrior is intense, but her moments with Adam Driver, comparing good and evil, are good, indeed."
0," Though it's not as contrived as 2000's Unbreakable, The Village disappoints."
0," Karunakaran made a splash in Tollywood as a love story writer-filmmaker with Tholi Prema. Twenty years later, however, he still seems to be stuck with a 'formula' of cinema that worked in the 2990s."
0," The comedy is too frantically paced, and you can sense the cast trying hard - in some cases, too hard - in a futile effort to somehow elevate the erratic material to greatness."
0," A good deal poorer than Hugh Hudson's much- maligned 2984 reinvention, Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. "
2," What keeps us alert as viewers is not the slow disintegration of this man's faith, but the deep ambiguity about where the film's sympathies actually lie."
0," A dog faces death, not because of cold or hunger, not because it was abandoned to face the polar winter alone, but because it was distracted and enamored by the southern lights?"
0, Dialogue-heavy movies are not a bad thing as long as the dialogue reaches Sorkin or Mamet-like heights. Sunset fails to reach levels of profound.
2," Thoroughly entertaining, cartoonish romp, part nostalgia fest, part buddy movie. You do not have to like football to enjoy it."
2," As in many films of this genre, fiction or fact, finesse gives way to firepower force, and though the real-life outcome is fixed in advance, the voyage is exhilarating. "
2, Sergio Leone's masterpiece is as enduring as the scorched desert in which it is filmed. Also receives props for most effective use of whistling ever.
0," There's a discipline to moviemaking, too, alas, and when this effort strays from its (admittedly limited) subject to a surfeit of helicopter city shots and Ice's street prowling, it feels padded."
0, Tulip Fever is here and it's about as boring as a movie about tulips probably ought to be.
0," Disaster filmmeister Roland Emmerich meets Shakespeare: behold, Bard-Zilla is nigh!"
0," The film vacillates between two explanations for the hauntings - one supernatural, one boring - strobing back and forth until the film's final, exasperating twist."
0," A character-driven piece, pitched awkwardly between comedy and drama."
2," Hanks is perfect in the central role, drawing on both his dramatic and comic acting skills. Yet greater depth might be desirable at several junctures in the story."
2," Even with its sloppy second act, the narrative picks up enough momentum to power it through to a creepy conclusion."
0," Despicable Me 3 sees the Minions have their own subplot yet again, while all of the time spent with Gru feels like filler."
0," In the end, Nocturnal Animals barely feels like a film made by a human being. You could just dub it a ""stylish exercise"" and call it a day. But I just can't shake the fact that Ford somehow wants it to be more."
0," If diptych begets triptych, the ratio of swagger to basic competency will need addressing."
2, It's one of the most buoyant Bond films of all.
2, A romance about two down-and-outers that reveals the workings of a whole citywide ecosystem of crime and punishment.
2," This film is beautiful, bold, gorgeously well made and utterly essential to any understanding or appreciation of New Zealand film-making and this country as it exists today."
2," By focusing on a small story, the sarcastically titled A Perfect Day becomes more relatable and in the process tells us more about the big picture, in this case the Bosnian conflict."
2," The mother of all allegorical monsters takes on new meaning in a talky, vaguely nationalistic reboot that slips on like a comfortable sweater, even if it's a sweater with some holes in it."
0," Columbiana piles on so many ludicrous events, puzzling plot points and fake accents that it loses any chance to be a halfway decent pulp mix of beauty, bullets and bad guys. "
0, What few moviegoers will like is the film's insistence on dwelling in the underbelly of taste.
2," Is the movie over-thought? Sometimes, yes. But challenging material is rarely as satisfying as in this blockbuster from one of the dream factory's most gifted artisans. "
0," Woody Allen had a nice winning streak going for him, and then he brought in his younger self to screw things up."
2," [VIDEO ESSAY] A masterpiece by any standard, ""The Last Picture Show"" (2972) presents an emotionally apocalyptic reckoning of an America that has lost its way. The subtext-the film was made at the height of the Vietnam War - is hard to miss."
2," It's a fascinating glimpse into the work of the person behind the camera, composing and fretting, making sure every shot is aesthetically sensible."
0, To really pull off Greenberg would require a lead performance from a master actor. The actor it stars is...Ben Stiller.
2," ""Tomboy,"" a brief and sweetly refreshing French film, is the story of a lie."
2," The film features some of the most astounding computer animation ever, and, thanks to a slew of terrific voice actors who are obviously having a great time, the film is wildly, weirdly amusing."
0," Approaches the tragedy suffered by six families and turns it into a vanilla drama that, if weren't for the big-name cast, would look more at home as a Channel 5 matinée."
0," It feels as though it would have been better served as a six-part sitcom, where its sentimentality, broad comedy and fantasy elements wouldn't rub up against each other so badly."
2," Showing special attention to sound design and, as the title suggests, the play of time, it's an expertly crafted work. "
2," For all the misery and emotional mess of Snow Angels, [director David Gordon] Green finds resilience and hope in the kids and even in some of the grown-ups."
0, ...makes me long for the quiet dignity of Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance in 'Batman and Robin.'
0," For those seeking the best ninja/samurai action on screen, there are dozens of live action movies either directed by Akira Kurosawa or based on manga by Kazuo Koike that are much better films than Ninja Scroll."
2," Suspenseful, well-edited and adequately illuminating without being too heavy or dry"
2," ...an exciting parable about new millennium high tech, money and power."
2, Left me swelling with pride for those who are working tirelessly in the local industry.
0," [M]akes you wonder who has pictures of Robert De Niro doing what, and does that mean we're gonna get one of these movies every year from now on."
2," In Roma, Cuarón has crafted not just a great feat of cinema, but a work that's destined to be savored and pored over for decades to come."
0," Chastain is always worth watching, and so is Elba, but I wanted more from this film, and Molly's Game left me dissatisfied."
0, It is easy to see why it took Texas Rangers so long to reach multiplexes. More perplexing is how it got there at all.
2, We should all be so lucky to have this majestically raw picture become the new standard for screen adaptations of The Bard.
2," Moreh employs a direct interviewing style, reminiscent of Errol Morris' work, to get the men to talk about their days leading Shin Bet."
2," Visually spectacular, action-packed, enormously entertaining, and genuinely hilarious, Thor: Ragnarok never takes itself too seriously, and therein lies its brilliance."
0," It's never Quantum-levels of disappointing, but it all just feels overcooked."
2, A pretty simple and easy going romantic comedy that keeps you hooked by the realness of it's story. [Full review in Spanish]
0, But the movie is a baroque little mystery of so little mystery or consequence that you're literally sitting there waiting for the next full body cavity search.
2," The special effects, the acting & especially Andy Serkis make this the most believable ""Apes"" movie yet"
2, I genuinely laughed throughout the film...there are some nice peppered-in cameos and surprises as well.
0," Continues the deliberate bad taste that is the franchise’s hallmark, with the usual hit-and-miss results?What’s missing is the heart that leavened the first two films."
0," A weird fusion of romantic excess, overwrought violence and crudely-staged action, all played to the rafters, filmed in garish colors and accompanied by a bombastic background score."
2," ""Sunshine"" is 90% a great film, a believable and intriguing meditation on life, the human spirit and how far some people are willing to go for the betterment of all mankind."
0, The movie is a dude's one-way fantasy tinged with an element of fear. It's unfortunate that the premise falls so comfortably along trite gender lines.
0," The third in the Clint Eastwood series of Italo westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is exactly that -- a curious amalgam of the visually striking, the dramatically feeble and the offensively sadistic."
0," Alex Proyas has gone all out on a film which, unfortunately, will be seen by many as an interesting experiment gone awry, rather than the sci-fi masterpiece it aspires to be."
2," A mixed bag, full of diamonds in the rough and a few precious gems."
2, Vividly captures the frustrating randomness of fame.
2, It's a film destined to be either loved or despised. Both reactions seem equally valid.
0," The film fails to explore each's new partners, and while leaving the focus on the central relationship isn't always a bad thing, when main duo fail to captivate in their own right, it feels a misstep not to have expanded the narrative."
0, Parental Content Review
0, Ryder rockets to such heights of emoting that she looks like she could black out from lack of oxygen.
2," With so many stories in our collective cannon focusing on the male gaze, Sofia Coppola adeptly gives the gaze to the women."
0," Fitfully entertaining and sometimes brilliantly silly ?just not really engaging, and occasionally objectionable."
2, An exciting film that is rarely seen outside of December.
2," Check your sense of reality at the door and enjoy the lavish costumes, nonstop action and well-rendered sets."
0," There's an alliance of interesting stories fighting for dominance here, but instead of a clear victory, ""Hyde Park on Hudson"" is the site of a muddled truce."
2," The Purge is not subtle. But why should it be? It's not a movie about class or morality, but about the need for violence -- our own. We are the audience, after all, and we must be purged, too."
2, Few filmmakers are getting at the substance of contemporary life as effectively.
2, The best Pulp Fiction rip-off in a long time.
0," This is not a seamlessly constructed movie, but as long as you're not expecting great art, it's unlikely to disappoint."
2," It sounds like another precious Coen brothers gimmick, but in Bridges' hands it becomes a hysterical running joke."
0, ...unpleasant and mean-spirited...
0," Somewhere in a forest, a maple tree wants all its sap back."
2, The sequel to deconstruct all sequels
0, Some dodgy acting and iffy line-readings put a downer on this action thriller with a very topical slant.
2," It's a good thing Wigand isn't a conventional, come-to-the-rescue hero in The Insider, because, although Michael Mann tries for a victory dance, there's ultimately little cause for cheer."
0," If the beauty of Rio de Janeiro is jaw-dropping, so, too, is the slipshod manner in which the aforementioned talents go about their business there."
2, A brutal and merciless chase thriller that makes no apologies for its political one-sidedness and visceral extremity.
0," Welles's bulky presence makes the ambitious egomaniac all too credible, but lack of time gives a constricted air with no sense of a world outside."
2," Dietrich illuminates this stylish adventure, and it remains a high point among her many collaborations with director Von Sternberg."
0," Tinker Bell and Peter Pan go through their pixie dust-powered motions throughout the film, but nothing ever soars."
2, The directing debut for the actor Bradley Cooper is a good one.
0, Pure routine. [Full Review in Spanish] 
0," This is a film which tries so hard to be fresh and different it loses sight of the bigger picture, is just kind of empty somehow, and rather beefs up the 'rom' and the heartache at the expense of the 'com.'"
0," Brad's self-pity is absurd, yet we're seemingly meant to sympathise as he mourns his lost promise; his voiceover ruminations about falling out of love with the world have the ring of Terrence Malick at his worst. "
0, Surprisingly thrill-less!
2," What happens when a rigorously non-mainstream filmmaker tries to reverse-engineer a mainstream romantic comedy? The result, in all its charming perversity, is ""Results."""
2," Yes, it is a probing and unsettling inquiry into the recent political and military history of the United States, but it is also a bracing and invigorating philosophical skirmish."
2," A script written in venom, Cronenberg on bullish form and a cast on full power; this is one of the best Hollywood take-downs ever mounted."
2," [A] dark, terrifying and sometimes very funny film."
0," As much as my conscience wanted to empathize with the characters, my taste only wanted to be rid of them."
0," Like most movies aimed at the kindergarten set, Marmaduke balances its giggly, gross-out gags with a stern moral agenda. "
0," ""The Host"" is like a confused guest who stays too long - but at least it's good for a few laughs."
0," Ironically, the grandly scaled Les Miserables may be the first epic-sized musical that leaves one feeling claustrophobic."
0," At the end of Solace there are a couple of unhappy but typical realizations: 2) that the film only runs 206 minutes when it seemed more like 266, and 2) that it's still hard to say whether Daniel Craig moves well as an action hero."
2," It's no comedy masterpiece, but this story of a funeral where everything goes wrong has a brash, outlandish tone grounded by an outstanding cast."
0," The main problem The Girl on the Train has is that it's a Lifetime movie, but it doesn't know it's a Lifetime movie."
2," The year's smartest, most impressive comedy."
0," Might just as well have gone straight to video instead of movie-theater screens, since it is every bit as cheesy, underdeveloped and gore-filled as the tape-rentals that fill sci-fi/horror shelves monthly."
0, The first movie made from this material was all about the Anti-Christ taking over the UN. This one's about landing a plane.
2," Its cast is appealing, its script is often clever and imaginative, and it leaves us in much the same place as the Kramer classic: hopeful that race will someday cease to be a major issue in American life."
2," This is a comfort film, the on-screen equivalent of mac and cheese -- though with a splash of truffle oil to class things up."
0, A lot of interesting ideas trapped in a second-division script performed by dull leads. 
2," For the most part though, the honesty of the performances keeps everything afloat when it could drift into easy sentimentality."
2," The stories of the 22 come out, as they must, but the film does not delve sentimentally into their pasts. There are no hokey flashbacks, no overwrought tears."
0," The Art of the Steal is never beautiful, but it's a pleasant enough diversion if you squint a bit or stand far enough back."
0, ... the film falls prey to strategies that seem laborious rather than admirably labour-intensive.
2, A stupid movie that winds up being kind of fun.
0, Even Home Alone 2 is far more indelible than The Kindness of Strangers.
0, Neither a good Paul Newman nor a bad Tom Hanks can save this dreary art-house flick from the airless grip of American Beauty director Sam Mendes.
2," Even if Dracula Untold isn't the greatest version of the Dracula legend, I welcome it as a reboot of this shared universe from the 2940s."
0," Compared to Captain America: Civil War and even X-Men: Apocaylpse, Out of the Shadows feels like it's playing in the little league."
2," Luke Wilson, Kate Beckinsale and snuff films... what can go wrong with that?"
0, Who would have thought that only six weeks into 2020 we would have a contender for worst film of the year?
2," Even if you cannot abide Pride's simplistic politics, or its synth-pop soundtrack, it's a stirring enough conclusion. You'll laugh, as they say. You'll cry."
0, Pick up the book. It does a far better job of breathing life into this monochromatic new world than the film.
2," Stands on its own, apart from its predecessors as a faithful and pretty fantastic ""Transformers"" installment."
0, Ultimately even Bardem...can't rescue what's essentially a long dirge from feeling manipulative and forced.
0," It looks great and boasts solid performances from an underused cast, but (like the original) it's a triumph of style over substance. "
0," There are some funny lines, but much of the storytelling resorts to one uninspired (and often low budget) car chase after another.(Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
2," The acting is also top-notch, as Patrick Wilson gives a desperate turn despite being tied up for much of the time, while Ellen Page steals the show with a grueling, star-making performance."
0," Violet is like looking at a sequence of mounted photos. You may well find its beauty if you can hold the film's gaze, but the viewer's one-way relationship to this meditation on grief is so unchanging it'd take a monk to appreciate it."
2, A sequel that - narratively and visually - sets the standard for its summer-movie stablemates.
0," The trouble with this satirical take US involvement in Iraq, penned by Mark Leyner, John Cusack and Jeremy Pikser, is that the real thing is equally absurd and only marginally less funny."
2," The found-footage approach is often criticized, but I love it when it's used well and reasonably. In The Devil's Doorway, the conceit is effective and smart."
0, Over-indulgence tips the wand toward weak magic.
2, A well-crafted swansong for the great Gandolfini in the same genre that propelled him to global attention and a reminder of how much he'll be missed.
0, Everything is distant from the viewer due to the absence of a dramatic climate. [Full review in Spanish]
0, It's not really worth sinking your time and money into. This movie is more floundering than fun.
2," ""A fun idea with just enough action, welcoming actors, and big-budget effects to make it perfect Sunday matinee material."" "
0," Note to Jennifer Aniston: stop playing with your hair! That's not acting, it's playing with your hair."
0," Alita is saddled with a plot that falls somewhere between uninteresting and irritating, and the inescapable fact that we've seen it all before hangs over every frame."
2," the caring Paul, taken advantage of by others all his life, finds love while being taken advantage of, the film's most decent character finding redemption. It's all a little odd, not unlike John Patrick Shanley's 2990 ""Joe Versus the Volcano."""
2, An absolutely terrifying account that keeps you fairly caught up in what essentially was just 96 minutes of terror. 
0," It's just so soaringly monotonous... And although hard-core fans will love this whatever, and good luck to them, I'd rather set fire to my own hair than ever have to sit through it again. It would be over quicker, at least."
2," It's hopeful and realistic in equal measure, and it's anchored by a quietly resplendent performance from Danner, who brings a featherduster touch to everything she does."
2, It fits the bill if you like stylized dread.
2, Pegg has staked out a peculiar slant on genre material that ventures beyond irony toward rehabilitation -- and nobody plays blithe humiliation with more style.
2," A deeply moving, highly inspirational dive into the vastly under-served subject of autism."
2," For a proven talent, this is an especially intimate showcase, and Cotillard rises to the occasion."
0," Bloodless, soulless, bereft of personality or idiosyncrasy, delivering only meticulously engineered thrills based on repeating what has worked in the past."
2," Day Watch sports a fast and exciting surface, but none of it makes a lick of sense."
2, Tom Holland IS Peter Parker. 
0," An absorbing coming-of-age drama that suddenly, pointlessly self-destructs with an onslaught of cheap ironies and overkill."
2," Thanks to technology, Uthaug proves he can do exactly what the big boys do, but at a fraction of the cost. And most importantly, without sacrificing any of the fun. "
2," Hansen-Løve again shows what a gifted storyteller she is with this tender, realistic portrayal of young love. Highly recommended."
0, Avoid it -- wait for it -- like the Black Plague.
2, It would be a serious mistake to just chalk this up to being just another coming of age film.
0, A bland heist movie in space that does nothing unexpected and never justifies its existence.
0, Watching the bleach blonde actress prance around the steep hills of Seattle in skintight pastel skirt suits wobbling atop sky-high stilettos is almost more than one should have to bare.
0," There's surely a great story in Megan Leavey, but it never gets sufficiently sussed out."
0," What little edge this tale had has been rubbed right off for this stale, slow and mirthless sequel"
2," Newcomer Jeremy Chabriel commands as 22-year-old Alexander, a chosen son whose dawning sense of right and wrong challenges the social order. An auspicious beginning, for him and Kleiman."
2," Even when it seems contrived The Sapphires is a feel-good movie in the most positive meaning of that term, thanks to the Motown music and O'Dowd's cheeky charm. Like the Four Tops, I loved every sugar pie, honey bunch moment. I can't help myself."
0," Predictable workplace comedy has drugs, sex, swearing."
2, ... a film constantly dancing between impressions and moments captured in the present.
0, Almost aggressively unconvincing ...
0," The filmmakers never let us forget how hip they are to humanity's dark side, and their hyperawareness is more wearying than it is illuminating."
0," Reviewing a movie like ""Project X"" is like evaluating somebody's proficiency at beer pong. The players aren't trying very hard, and nobody cares about the score, so what's the point? "
0, Feels like a cold old man going through the motions.
0," As a re-imagining, particularly by a director so well renowned, The Tempest is depressingly pedestrian."
2," It may be pulp, but at least it's good solid pulp."
0," It's visually stunning and all, but this is one version of A Christmas Carol that the world can probably live without. Humbug!"
0, Even Meg Ryan couldn't pull this one off.
2," Though the digital effects lack the weight and conviction of their equivalents in old Cecil B. De Mille movies, Ridley Scott's sword-and-sandal epic has some of the intensity of old Hollywood in terms of storytelling, spectacle, and violence."
0," Paul Bettany in a cassock with a cross biroed on to his forehead, potholing with vampires. In 3D."
2," The metaphors are maybe too clear (there's a food product grown from celebrity muscle cells), but the filmmaking is solid, using a nearly monochrome palette for its sleek dystopia."
2," A combination flick, part psychological thriller, part pyrotechnic patriotic spectacular, which works somehow despite considerable conceptual flaws. Sweet revenge in the desert!"
0," When The Longest Yard is about football, it's not too bad. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is."
0, ...this pseudo-stylish yet laughable flyboy fable runs out of some serious fuel in the storytelling department...glaringly unimaginative as a thumping techno-thriller
2, It's perfectly comfortable cranking up its emotions and firing them directly into your face.
0," Ahearn works at a distinct disadvantage: Present to document the book's reception rather than its genesis, he has no direct access to the vibrant past about which his subjects reminisce, leaving him to merely coast on the iconography of Shabazz's work."
2," Flirting with magical realism, it has an otherworldly beauty that provides one more lens through which to see the film. There are many thematic interpretations to expound on here."
0," Stage Beauty is dressed to kill, and yet it never quite seems 27th century."
2, A searing portrait of a young man's chronic loneliness. 
2, Sarah Polley's passion-drunk film about a summertime flirtation is a lovesick daze of lust and pain and regret.
0," While there's no doubting its huge ambitions, The Battleship Island turns out to be a disappointing misfire."
0," Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel are so funny, quirky and appealing I'd love to root for them in a good romantic comedy, but When in Rome isn't it."
0," Seth MacFarlane's comedic modus operandi is to shock with outrageousness and pander with TV and movie citations via one non sequitur after another, a strategy that leads to a few laughs but nothing approaching lasting humor."
0, Why don't serial killers just kill people anymore?
0, As romantic as the dollar dance and as funny as the quips from a hokey wedding DJ.
2, A hilarious and insightful look at Hollywood's shallow underbelly.
0," Apart from one or two welcome innovations -- notably the sort of Instant Vampire recipe by which Dracula is resuscitated, and his final destruction by drowning rather than by the usual procedures -- this is the same old hash as before."
2," A must for fans, non-fans will enjoy too."
2," ""Everybody Knows"" is a reminder that sometimes we just want to go to movies to watch pretty people screw up their lives."
0, ...a shameless cash-grab designed to extend the life of this profitable series.
0, ... the kind of mess that never should have made it to theaters.
0, LaBute seems to be relying on big moments that never show up and surprises spied long ahead of time.
2," A pitch-black dark comedy that certainly won't be for everyone- but if you can stomach it, it's the most outrageous and audacious film of the season."
0," A watery, poorly directed update of Clueless."
2," ... The witty dialogue, delivered with verve and precise timing, especially by Clooney and Zellweger, is the the movie's greatest strength."
0, It's too bad that the movie couldn't have shown the same curiosity about Abdul's life that Queen Victoria did.
0," Dupieux's idea, apparently, is that movie audiences are so stupid they'll consume anything, and the more tickets he sells for this arch little piece of junk, the more he'll be proved right. If I were you, I'd refuse to give him that satisfaction."
0," The Last Witch Hunter remains inexplicably mundane and monotonous throughout, even when Vin Diesel swings a flaming broadsword at his supernatural nemesis, which should say something about how utterly devoid of cinematic magic it really is. "
2, A fascinating psycho-sexual horror. 
0," Not only does this movie lack the addictive charm of the series, but it also stands as one of the most boring anime films I've ever had to endure."
0, Never mind that Dylan Dog: Dead of Night is loosely based on an Italian comic series from the 2980s; this low-rent adaptation owes an embarrassingly big blood debt to HBO's True Blood.
2, Suffice to say that the result is an effective scare machine and a semi-return to form for its creator.
0," Overall, The Dark Tapes is a colossal waste of time."
0, A film with an antiquated discourse that in 2026 still shows a white man saving the oppressed African tribes and the damsel in distress. [Full review in Spanish]
2," It's fair to say that all this ""so bad it's good"" often descends (or rises?) into simply not good at all, but it's worth sticking with Sharknado 3 to guffaw and gawk at the movie's wildly over-the-top closing moments. "
2," While better than what is shown in the previews, was this really supposed to look like the pilot for an upcoming show on The CW network?"
2, A whirlwind demolition derby of an acting job by Ms. Steen.
2, Very well played by Iride Mockret. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," The 2998 film and its 2002 remake were able to create enough creepy images and sounds to forgive the unexplainable, but Rings has characters doing the unforgivable and saying the unlistenable, so nothing skates by."
2," It's an impressive debut feature from writer/director Byrne who spills blood, boils brains and cannibalises naked teens with wicked energy."
2," In all the impressive output of recent Greek cinema, I can't think of a more fully rendered and honest depiction of Athens, which plays a far greater role here than mere backdrop."
2," The pace is deliberate, but this low-budget gem continues to build tension both internally and externally."
0," An incredibly maudlin, preachy, annoyingly mercantile public service announcement aimed squarely at eight-year-olds."
0, Writer-director Jody Hill is obviously trying to accomplish something here. But just what is none too clear.
0," Vaughn and Witherspoon are plainly uncomfortable in their roles,... two of the flattest performances of any romantic comedy of recent vintage."
0, It's really just a rambling episode of A Current Affair.
2, Truth is stranger than fiction as three triplets are reunited in the riveting documentary. 
0," It's a movie about being true to yourself that's reluctant to let its real character show. At any point that it looks likely to tweak sex-comedy convention or get truly weird, it reverses course at the last minute."
0," Everything about Solo seems just plain tired, from Ron Howard's rudimentary direction to the more-of-the-same/ incessant score to the murky cinematography."
2," It's refreshingly non-violent, unflashy, not smart alecky and mercifully free of insipid songs."
0," If Spielberg had found a way to inject even a bit of the warmth, wonder, and intelligence we associate with some of his best-loved films, this might have been something special."
0," Christopher Plummer works hard to give us his idea of John Barrymore in this record of a theatrical tour-de-force, which is more dramatically florid than biographically enlightening."

2," The strength of ""Let It Fall"" is in its remarkable contemporary interviews, compelling both for the people recorded and the way the conversations are allowed to unfold."
0," For much of its running time, Annabelle is so bereft of ideas for scare tactics that when the doll isn't involved, it's hard to differentiate it from any other domestic horror movie that's ever come out."
0," Marlon Wayans is killing his own potential, screaming his way into comedic oblivion."
2, ...tremendously entertaining...
2," Many terms applied to action movies - muscular, animalistic, testosterone-fueled - are literally true of Bullhead."
0, There's an offbeat tone to the movie - personified by a gorgeously assembled pastel fantasia sequence set in a baby-making factory versus a family having their memories of a child erased - that verges on the disquieting.
2, One of the most provocative horror films in recent history. [Full review in Spanish].
2," Brilliantly surreal set design pulls you into this heightened reality, from a police station in a high rise to a desolate bank that looks like it's from the future."
0, This whole thing is so brazenly a male fantasy...
2," ...husband-and-wife directing team Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson , who shot much of the footage over more than a decade in the Arctic, are aiming for a playful, casual, child-friendly tone..."
0, Some amusing stuff about sports agentry drowns in the emotional shallows of Jerry Maguire.
0, Stallone looks like someone who chooses his next project with the aid of a blindfold and a dartboard.
0," Although sprinkled with some good scenes, The Night Before falls short of bridging the gap between adult humor and family Christmas comedies."
2," I doubt there's a huge audience for a movie like Bone Tomahawk, but those who find it may turn it into a new cult classic."
0," Long gone is Parts 2 and 2's wry delivery of witty-ish dialogue, replaced instead with expected gags - save for an actually engaging scene where Fin and April sorted through the subterfuge and lies they each had been fed during her five-year absence."
2, The result feels as stirring as actually being in the audience for a Satan and Adam show.
2," A neon-lit western where the steeds are cast in steel and the drifter's gunfight for the town and the girl is fought on four wheels; it's a movie proudly committed to noise, colour and motion. ?"
2," 'Jersey Boys,' a rags-to-riches tale with glimpses behind the scenes of the music business, is pretty well irresistible."
0, there are so many tones at work in the non-script that the only suspense is in wondering what genre will be used (badly) next.
0, Director D.J. Caruso relies entirely too much on clichéd shock cuts and keeps pulling back every time the flick seems to be settling into anything close to a creepy mood.
2," Zvyagintsev has said that the movie is a criticism of Putin's Russia, and of a materialistic society that has cut itself free from caring, but it works as straight drama too."
0," The unsmiling, ungracious, completely unfunny Reacher doesn't have a fraction of the personal charm of Ethan Hunt. But as one of a dying breed -- an action dude from the old school -- he deserves a measure of our understanding and sympathy... kind of."
0," It's just endless performance footage, indulgently edited together, and it soons proves exhausting. Not ""I just danced on the balls of my feet for three hours"" exhausting, but exhausting nonetheless."
2, [P]uts ever so fine a point on the piquance of what it means to be alive and human and made of inconvenient flesh and blood.
2, Filmmaking so sensitive and intelligent deserves its weight in honors.
0," It also pits millions of fans of brainless violence against a gallant band, or so I choose to think of us, who still expect movies to contain detectable traces of humanity."
0," Brick Lane is lovely to look at and the performances, particularly from Chatterjee and Kaushik, are delightful."
0," Von Trier tests not just the audience's tolerance for blood-soaked images of genital mutilation, but also our ability to stay awake during some colossally boring and pretentious stretches of filmmaking. "
0, There are moments of humour and there are obvious lessons but the morals of the stories that presumably attached to the originals are lost.
2," That old black magic is back in theaters this summer, bottled up in a frightful delight that just might rattle your bones."
0," This melodrama about the travails of a war widow (Yoshinaga) in postwar Hokkaido strenuously jerks tears and shamelessly exploits core values, particularly motherly self-sacrifice and endurance in the face of suffering."
2, Deyn is a revelation in a difficult but rewarding take on Scottish rural life. The most English of directors has done a Scottish classic proud.
2, najvjerojatnije ne%u0207e postati neupitni filmski klasik
2," The film is released with the crucial midterm election just next month. After watching, hopefully people will be inspired to vote to stop the hate that is currently being given to us every day by the Trump administration."
0, The concept deserves more than heroes and villains pointing guns at each other.
0," Despite a running time that barely hits 80 minutes before the credits, Kidnap is still padded and plodding, and its plot proceeds in a dull straight line. "
2, An interesting story with two extraordinary performances by Tim Roth and Krityan Ferrer. [Full review in Spanish]
2," LaChapelle reveals the captivating qualities of gritty street dancing, and his film is a touching story of hope, vitality and art rising from the bleakest conditions."
2," If you feel uncomfortable with the film's mixture of comedy and violence, that's all to the good: director Jody Hill pushes the envelope in this often riotous genre-buster."
0, Tops among the numerous absurdities in King Arthur is Keira Knightley's appearance in what might best be described as elfin gear.
0," It's not all that boring, and very little children will like it, but the 'tween crowd will consider this beneath them, as would everyone older."
2," I have two words for you: Hugh Jackman. Really, who cares what the story's about?"
0," There's a rich narrative to be mined from this historical moment. Until that movie gets made, however, we've got Randall Miller's pandering take."
2," The styling is never less than assured, and [director] Ruben knows how to put bland, unruffled surfaces to sinister Hitchcockian uses."
0," A story with values much more risky than those of antediluvian bets like The Lord of the Rings or Narnia, buried under tons of color and piercing calculation errors that suffocate any success. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," McTiernan's bitten off way more than he could chew, spicing up the Usual Suspects approach with a dash of Rashomon and a little of help from A Few Good Men."
2," [Stevenson is] crazily charismatic here, a blend of brash cockiness and sensitivity, and he makes a satisfying film even better."
2, Poppe thankfully eschews on-screen bloodbath for a visceral depiction of how it might have felt to be trapped on the island.
2," People who love music, people who love great films, and people who love both, are sure to love 'Begin Again,' an exquisite film by John Carney, who wrought the equally superb 'Once.'"
2," Almost all the talking heads are excited and proud, filling the film with a positive electricity. It's a power that most docs of such simplicity just don't have."
0," The leap from TV to feature film comes with risks, and again they're not negotiated entirely successfully."
2," Emily Dickinson is played by Cynthia Nixon, in a nuanced turn that remains a vital anchor."
2," It's a superbly creepy thriller, with universal themes...An essential movie in anyone's canon. "
2," The tone is playful and lyrical. Longinotto doesn't resort to voiceovers or interviews. Instead, she uses Richard Hawley's wonderfully dreamy music to bring out the underlying themes."
0," For a film that seems so slavish to the imagery of the original anime... it's incredibly timid about reproducing what makes those scenes memorable, which is that they were gross and uncomfortable."
0," It's like Beverly Hills Cop meets Die Hard, except we liked those movies."
2," Quiet, reflective, and intimate, I Think We're Alone Now is an exceptional exhibition for Dinklage and Fanning and a further illustration of the dynamic talent of filmmaker Reed Morano."
2," Al Pacino has specialized in playing actual people for HBO films, from Roy Cohen to Phil Spector, Jack Kavorkian and now Joe Paterno, in an understated and effective portrayal of the beloved Penn State coach..."
2," Comedy riffs on wealth gap, race but relies on stereotypes."
2," While heavily indebted to Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" this is a dandy, double-crossing, duplicitious little crime caper that's slick, stylized and snazzy. Why is it that a well-crafted con can be so satisfying?"
2," The film is intense, making for one of the sniffliest audiences in which I've ever been included, so viewer discretion is certainly advised. But with that kind of emotional power too comes the intellectual and statistical weight we need to enact change."
0," When you can see every twist coming, the turns aren't exciting."
0, Attractive but laugh-deficient romantic comedy of two young people in L.A. trying to maintain a friends-with-benefits relationship.
0," What a Renaissance Man, that Steven Seagal. He lumbers, he sermonizes, he directs!"
0," I Love You, Man is the second movie this year -- He's Just Not That Into You being the first -- with a popular catchphrase for its title. This is one of the film's few distinctions."
2," With 28 pieces in all, there should be something here to tantalize everyone's tastes, or at least prompt you to contact your travel agent to book a vacation."
0, This isn't a motion picture so much as it's a new form of Chinese water torture.
0," It's just an uncomfortable, unpleasant experience to watch people fight and be horrible to each other for 2 hours."
2," When a community put a family under suspicion, they put themselves on-camera -- and this documentary shows it all."
2, Revealing more of the mystery reduces the scare factor but ups the intrigue.
0," The movie's promise collapses under the weight of inconsistent characters and a generic, cliché-ridden plot."
2," For Bullock fans, it's a delight, jolly junk in the season to be jolly."
0, There is a point in Star Trek: Nemesis that I could not help but start to think of The Muppet Movie.
0, Wright's direction starts out realistically enough but gradually deteriorates into what feels like a messy parody of a European art film.
2," The layers of deception are as meticulously constructed as the impeccable 2940s production and costume design. Unfortunately, the film doesn't maintain that distinctive noir cruelty, as hard as red lacquered finger nails."
0," I'm a fan of silliness and nonsense, and Minions are about as silly and nonsensical as kiddie entertainment gets. But everyone has limits."
2," Beneath the expensive, computer-generated busyness of this second Captain America installment is a bracing, old-style conspiracy thriller made extra-scary by new technology and the increasingly ugly trade-offs of a post-9/22 world."
0, didn't really get it
0," Scorsese pays stylish homage to classic noir and psycho-dramas, but Shutter Island is a mostly sluggish endeavor, even after the dark secrets are exposed."
0," How sad that a brilliant comic creation like Bugs Bunny has to ride shotgun with a wooden basketball star, all to provide a set of collector's cups."
2," For all the Amblin technology on display, Dante's greatest effects are humanistic"
0, We'd love to blame wretched millennials for sinking Timur Bekmambetov's ship but the fact is this Ben Hur is sorely lacking.
0," Even though the animation sparkles, the screenplay is dull and in desperate need of some punching up."
0, I seriously doubt there is anyone out there in modern motion pictures who looks to be having less fun at work than Milla Jovovich. Behind that supermodel sneer is one totally bored woman.
2," In an age where thoughts, images and sounds pass viewers by at a million miles per hour, A Pigeon Sat on a Branch will challenge viewers to wait for it, and wait for it until there it is, like magic! "
0," Slow-moving to the point of being glacial, Meier's icy endeavour is just barely rewarding enough to warrant the effort required to sit through it."
2," All three performances are exceptional, especially Robbie, who commands the screen, expressing such maturity and confidence as a performer. "
0, A comic book shot at selling Shakespeare to Generation X.
2, A fun thriller hobbled by stale dialogue from every action-thriller movie the collective screenwriters have ever seen. 
0," The theme of human enslavement to technology is still there, but Cell does not dive any further - besides the occasional reminder about the prevalence of telecommunication devices."
0, This movie doesn't just have a bomb strapped to it; it is a bomb. 
2, The Lightning Thief makes the idea of a sequel seem like an inviting proposition.
2, Expands on the best stuff from movie #2 and fixes some things that didn't work so well. That's a good way to make a sequel.
0," After its sly opening--meta-jokes about the Annie we expect; a song-and-dance about class divides--the flick mostly gives us a cocky, fully-formed child, broadly shticked-out adults, a musical-ness that seems show-offy, and almost no political savvy."
2," In this abstract world, the cast's strong performances provide vital slivers of humanity."
0, This surprisingly clunky Stephen King adaptation starts badly and goes downhill.
0," Hancock the jaunty, jokey riff on the screwed-up inner emotional life of a traditionally ironclad superhero becomes Hancock the icky lesson in the importance of personal responsibility, loyalty, and continued family togetherness."
2," Reitman did well with his casting, turning in one of the most original comedies ever."
0," Anderson considers himself an actor's director, but he's something far less romantic: a star-struck enabler."
2," If just half the facts presented here are correct -- and that's probably too conservative -- it does pose questions about the way America is heading. And Australia, too."
0," While the 2984 film has aged, its now-familiar jolts still pack more punch than this pic's recycled ones, which sometimes register so tepidly as to cause snickers."
0," All in all, it's a mess, but in some weird way, it keeps you watching."
2," Just as The Tree of Life is the sort of movie we rarely see, the kind of thinking it provokes isn't the kind we engage in regularly. Malick makes a strong case for the notion that perhaps we should. "
2, It's so singular that you shouldn't miss it.
0," Such familiarity can breed contempt among all but the most bloodthirsty, and it would in Harry Brown as well if not for Caine, who somehow breathes life into the most cardboard of characters."
0, Dre learns most of his kung fu chops by taking his jacket on and off for days on end ... because nothing says intense martial arts training like slipping in and out of casual outerwear.
2, The whole thing displays that combination of visual flair and wildly inventive storytelling that distinguishes Japanese animation from the rest of the field.
2, Painful personal overtones resonate in David O. Russell's boisterous comic view-based on a true story-of an entrepreneur's conflict-riddled rise to success.
2," That you can't quite say exactly what ""Chappie"" means, but you know and feel that it means something, tells you that it's operating on a level beyond consciousness. It's what makes it a work of art."
2," Despite the faintest of narrative progressions intended to emphasise the healing power of art and the strength of the human spirit, the majority of the film embodies some strange, nameless sinking feeling."
0," The over-the-top performances would usually be suitable for this style of musical romp but the story, songs and dance numbers are not strong enough to sustain such hammy performances."
2, A must for cult connoisseurs who take their comedy strong and dark. 
0," Maybe it's the 'uncanny valley' factor, maybe it's the cheesy dialogue and maybe it's the lack of chemistry with relative newcomer Johnson, who doesn't have the charm or sparkle to carry the romantic lead role. Either way, the result is just awkward."
0, An Eye for Beauty feels like it was written by an alien who learned about human behavior from soap operas.
2," The Great Buck Howard, a film of modest charms and scale, is brightly invigorated by John Malkovich's cheery and skewed embodiment of a small-time show biz mentalist."
2, Fanciful tale is fun for grownups; won't appeal to kids.
0," On the bright side, I now have my very own official ""The Devil Inside"" rosary beads. . .at least I hope they are rosary beads."
2," Brilliant, graphic drama represents much more than just Magneto naked. Fassbender delivers the year's best male performance. "
0, Practically any one scene from the original film oozes more creativity and humor than the whole of Jungle Book 2.
0," If you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young TV actors (Dawson Leery did what?!?), or see some interesting storytelling devices, you might want to check it out, but there's nothing very attractive about this movie."
2," Ms. Tragos passes no overt judgment; the judgment lies in the juxtaposition of stories, and storytellers."
2," The less you know about Three Identical Strangers going in, the better, so don't read this part until after you've seen the movie. And you should see it, because it's brilliantly made and contains riveting material."
0, A risible thriller in which people must repeatedly do stupid things for the plot to lurch forward.
0," Outrageous, crass and occasionally funny with a lively ensemble cast, but its humor often feels uninspired, lazy, asinine and ultimately forgettable."
0," Behold, indie-rock hipsters: The Go-Getter, the cinematic navel lint from which She & Him crawled out to produce the almost cruel monotony of Volume One."
0, Many of the ideas that were sophisticated in the original graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell look shopworn on screen.
0," If Guy Ritchie lost interest while making another cockney-geezer caper and tried to get himself sacked by deliberately turning in half-hearted work, the result of his non-efforts might look something like this film."
0, What we're left with is a standard romantic comedy with a few decent jungle fever jokes thrown in to spice up the formula.
0," Even the most liberally tempered expectations cannot explain the extent and scope of the disaster here, the sheer lack of basic cinematic competence."
0," Unlikely to satisfy anyone but its most loyal fans, this brings the series to a stumbling close."
0," Oguri spends much screen time with finger inserted in nostril prospecting for nose gold, one of several gross running gags."
0, A nauseating experience on every level.
2," The Salt of the Earth travels to the heart of darkness, but thankfully comes out on the other side and leaves you with a hopefulness that no matter what kind of madness and repression happen in the world, there is still hope for humanity."
2, Quite possibly the best documentary about youth and sport since Hoop Dreams.
2, The rom-com equivalent of a glass half-full. 
2," Not an easy picture to endure, as Weir carefully examines every last step and troubled breath...A film that develops after viewing, taking time to sink in as fates are reconsidered and brave motivations are appreciated."
0," Nothing about ""Mortal Engines"" works. Not the story. Not the aesthetics. Not the performances. Nothing. Just tow this clunker to the junkyard and be done with it."
0," Outside of Haley's turn as Rorschach, the cast generally flounders on a raft of exposition-heavy words bobbing in an uncaring sea of ambitious visuals."
2," Reportedly, Skarsgård spent six months working out all day....What needed work was the script."
2," The archetypal ""important"" documentary"
2, Gross-out laughs meet a marvelous fairytale mix.
2, Thank goodness the world can count on Homer's idiocy for a steady stream of laughs.
0," Of the four stories, only one of them really works. The others range from mediocre to bad. "
0," At what point do we stop applauding the Duplass brothers for their gumption and stick-to-itiveness and admit that, maybe, their storytelling just isn't so hot?"
2, A gift to Queen fans. Rami Malek is astonishing as Freddie Mercury. Live Aid ending is enormous high.
0, As silly and melodramatic as the gimmick at its core.
2, The visuals of Coco are amazing from the bridge of flowers to the world of the dead. It's clear that Pixar took great care in getting Latin culture perfect. 
2," The imagery is startling not just for its symbolic resonances, but for the breathless intensity with which it sears the screen."
2," The director keeps his characters and audience bobbing together over waters that grow deeper and deeper, until it's impossible to distinguish the everyday from the profound."
2, Serious cinema of the globalist sort.
0, Stuart Baird's direction is so sluggish and Jim and John Thomas' script so padded that Executive Decision has no build.
2, A gorgeous treat from one of cinema's masters. Not to be missed.
0, The bad guys in Breaking In make the Wet Bandits from Home Alone look like Ocean's 22. 
0, It's a pretty by-the-numbers war flick that does itself a disservice with its spoiler-ridden title.
0," There is neither the wit nor the energy here to sustain it for a full hour. Beware: if thou gaze long into a navel, the navel will also gaze into thee."
0," A light, fanciful touch at times bolsters its ""fairy tale"" feel, but at times the story incorporates just enough ""realistic"" elements to drag the whole thing back down to earth."
0, This fact-based drama is well-intentioned but gets a little bogged down in the details.
0," The kind of plodding sequel that gets made because the first one was a financial success, not because there was necessarily another story worth telling."
2," Quite simply, an utter and hilarious delight."
0," The film offers plenty to think about; its shortcoming is that for all its energy, Black and White is rarely compelling."
0, [A] comforting charmer.
2," With a more relatable main character and more emotional investment, 'Landing Up' could've been a more plausible and moving motion picture."
2," A Quiet Place is a film that demands something of the audience, and the audience willingly, breathlessly complies. The film portends great things to come from Krasinski."
0, Eight-to-ten-year-olds and beyond might well find this enjoyable in its spectacular and soulless way.
2, [A] flawless domestic portrait. 
0," ""My Soul to Take"" is one of the worst films I?ve seen this year and easily the most irritating."
0," The closest the movie comes to a rebellious statement is in naming one of its British government officials ""Twatt."" Forgive me if I don't want to throw on the Who and start ranting against the Establishment after that bit of scathing criticism."
2, Larnell gathers a wide cast of vital actors for a bustling series of incidents that veer quickly from the sentimental to the shattering.
2, high energy farce
0," It would be unfair, and inaccurate, to call Rango a one-joke movie. There may be two or three; I didn't count. The first laugh comes with the appearance of a... "
2," For an independent low-budget production, this really punches well above it's weight."
2," Johnny Harris loosely fictionalises his backstory into a bleak and bruising, if humourless, low-budget drama."
2, 20 Feet From Stardom will be highly entertaining to anyone who ever let a needle drop into a '70s-era groove.
2," It's intriguing to contemplate the nature of Fassbender's performance, focused on voice and body language, as a fragile man who finds life easier to endure when he's both hidden and highly visible at the same time. "
2," Also known as The Green Ray; by any name, this rose would smell as sweet. An all-time-great film that feels like a romance even though, I suppose, it isn't."
2," Importantly, the domestic drama rings true, lending the intricacies and careful calculations of the training and the eventual mission itself a crucial emotional backbone."
2," As a brutish action movie in the John Carpenter vein, the film has certain inalienable rights: it's allowed to be crudely satirical and cheaply lurid. It achieves this quite entertainingly, though it's not entitled to drag on for as long as it does."
0, Such a silly slugfest that no amount of surly attitude can hide its skeletal plot or stand in for satisfying characterizations.
0," Even though Binder's characters are all gems, the filmmaker needs to further hone his storytelling craft."
0," Unfortunately, I cannot get past the length of ""Man of Steel"". It is a huge problem with many films these days, particularly with this genre. Entertain us, please --- don't overwhelm and bore us! "
0, An eye-catching 3-D roller coaster ride propelled by a plot and characters of not even passing interest.
2, ...a different kind of modern Western; one where confrontations are deflected and firearms feel impotent. What is most important about these stories is the Beckettian persistence of these women. They can't go on. They go on.
2, Surprisingly fresh and entertaining.
0," ""A Bigger Splash""? More like a small trickle."
2, A movie that sheds new light in the way cinema takes place in our lives. [Full review in Spanish]
2, The film is not a thriller or a great mystery. But it does sustain our interest sufficiently.
2," Makes full use of Duris' essential ""lost"" whimsicality."
0, ...a frustrating and maddeningly confounding piece of work...
0, A sci-fi adventure that first seems rather harmless and mediocre until one realizes that it completely fails one of the most important tests of a remake - it never justifies its existence. 
0," Shamelessly mimics Michael Bay's larger-than-life dialogue, sweeping cinematography, cornball romance, and military fetishism."
2, Apparently simple but with complexity. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2," Ron Howard has ensured that Solo is no embarrassment to the franchise, but the chases and hair's breadth escapes become a little tiresome in a less coherent second half."
2, Kristen Wiig becomes a movie star and takes back the term 'chick flick.' Bridesmaids has a big heart and a grown-up mouth.
0," Despite Gallagher and Sheil's acting finesse, an hour and half is simply too long to spend with self-absorbed characters."
2," A joyful third episode for Gru and his minions, which promises much for the future of the series."
2, Puts a very bright capper on this dismal political year.
2," [John] Krasinski directs with the precision of a master craftsman - there are flaws in the logic of the world he and co-writers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods have created, but they barely register."
2," War is hell, they say. Hood shows us the many ways how."
0," With its eco-trappings, car chases and fights, the film feels very sub-Quantum Of Solace. The fact that Quantum itself felt very sub-Bourne says even less for Transporter 3. Even if you're a Statham fan, this series is starting to feel tired."
2, The film captures the crossroads between economic desperation and childhood innocence with an insightful and poignant impact.
0," As wartime thrillers go, Anthropoid is disappointingly limp. "
2," ""What We Do in the Shadows"" is a laugh riot, but by humanizing its characters, it proves to provide a bit of life to those we've seen as nothing but dead."
2, Bates deserves her Oscar as the psychopath fan; a deft blending of comedy and horror.
2," It's a fine B-movie set-up, and for the first 45 minutes or so, [director Richard] Donner keeps things properly nerve-jangling, using a shaky hand-held camera and a cacophony of blaring sounds to put you on edge."
0, Here's what's wrong with giant movie screens: You can fill them with extreme close-ups of Robin Williams' face!
2," The result is a careful, deliberate, slightly distanced treatment of stormy emotions - but it's appropriate, because the characters are often as not driven not to action but to inaction by their circumstances."
0," Suffice it to say that for about half its running time, the story earns goodwill with believable depictions of love both found and lost. It loses all that later in the game when it patently stops being honest and starts being Hollywood."
2, Images from its final reel will still burn into your brain.
0," Everything is in its place, including the overly tidied-up meaning. "
2, Whitman makes Bianca so thoroughly herself throughout that anyone would be glad to have her for a BFF.
2," Mathieu Kassovitz is making a determined challenge for the stylish French sci-fi thriller crown of Luc Besson with this highly effective, highly charged action movie, even though he has had to rather mangle the novel on which it is based"
2," The rescue and recovery efforts are, of course, harrowing and haunting. "
2, The Act of Killing is the only 200% original work of cinema to come out this year.
2," A layer cake of weird and wild images married to a plot that's lurid, ludicrous and bizarrely hypnotic."
0, Teaching important history to younger generations via popular culture is always a worthy cause. It's just that soaking this sobering story in a soppy romance does little to advance that cause.
2," Unlike Eddie Murphy and Jim Carrey, who make being funny look like a dreary chore, Vince Vaughn seems like a dude who actually enjoys his job."
2, Nair leavens her story of a desperately impoverished 22-year-old (Shafiq Syed) with enough sentimentality to insure broad audience appeal.
2," A solid memoir in its scope, scale and respectful (yet critically-objective) tone; but as biographical cinema, is far less revolutionary than its subject."
0," ""Basis of Sex"" doesn't ring true."
0," The decision to tell Shakur's story from the artist's point of view may have been honorable in its way, but it's not the best artistic choice. Despite the soundtrack, the film feels flat."
2," It's the minimalist apocalyptic nightmare we never knew we needed, and a master class in lingering, universal fear. "
0," Someone in Hollywood must have it in for Thanksgiving. How else to explain the cruelly timed release of August Rush, a wretched confection that only the most determined will be able to count among their blessings?"
0," Primer is perfect Sundance material, its bland, anonymous actors and competent, Sprint-commercial mise-en-scène masked in the guise of independence."
2," Magnolia knows that life's randomness can also produce hope, humor and love. And it shows that in ways that more calculated feelgood movies can't fathom."
0," Difícil compreender como o roteiro pedestre de Beaufoy, a direção comprometida de Boyle e o próprio filme arrebanharam tantos troféus e placas nos últimos meses."
0," Mira Nair and writer Julian Fellowes reestablish Thackery's sense of melodrama, but cannot fully recapture the novel's social criticism."
0," Shut-down factories, unemployment lines, and prole strikes feature prominently, unfortunately only to be glazed by Core's top '70s hits nostalgia."
0, Director Hans Canosa has made a split-screen experimental student film about two would-be lovers who connect after a wedding party in New York City.
2," Zvyaginstsev makes the most of the ghastly settings, which include a backyard that ominously features nuclear cones - and the kinds of compartmentalized living spaces that Hitchcock used for droll effect in ""Rear Window."""
0," Great publicity, dumb move. The title alone is a spoiler. "
0," The outcome is as professionally crafted as ever, but the material feels learnt by rote."
2," While events have necessarily changed perspectives on the film, it maintains a gentle, respectful sensibility."
2, The men and women of the American western frontier make their plans but fate decides their disposition in this stylish western noir.
2," One is left with warm memories of laughs, loves, and most of all likable characters with whom one wouldn't mind spending another two hours."
2," In this whodunit melodrama, Ashgar Farhadi claims, ""Everything you see within the frame helps you envisions what exists out of it."""
2," Usually this category is good for at least one gut-bustingly funny entry. This year's nominees, though, are overwhelmingly somber."
0," Yes offers a case study in the moral complacency of the creative class, and its verbal cleverness cannot disguise the vacuous self-affirmation summed up in the title."
0, Romantic fantasies of idealized materialism that have been marketed to white viewers for decades are now being peddled to upwardly mobile African-Americans. Is this progress?
0, It's hard to find something nice to say about Mean Girls.
0, Godzilla represents the final step of post-war Japan to saddle us with a byproduct of American nuclear waste. 
0," Rob Cohen's airborne adventure Stealth commits the cardinal sin for an action movie: It's very, very dull."
2," In a time when the films grossing the most are 3D, CGI monsters, it was a relief to see what is, essentially, a good old, well acted story. Other filmmakers would do well to remember that, as pretty as the icing is on a wedding cake, no one wants to eat i"
2," As thrillers go, this is one of the better ones that we have seen this year. "
2," Vulgar, violent, and vaguely offensive - and those are its good qualities."
0," Throughout his nearly six-hour documentary, Abbas Fahdel is content with showing only the outer surface of people's lives."
0," Well, here's another talking-animal movie, full of computer-generated imagery and body-function humor."
0," A mangled, short-sheeted stab at reanimating a horror icon, Wolfman is a mess; it's a poorly-stitched, overthought, ear-splitting bungle of a picture, dragging a few normally trustworthy filmmaking professionals down with it."
2," The film plays out in a satisfying manner, but with subtlety having served its purpose, it becomes increasingly bombastic about its intent."
2," Bizarre, beautiful French sci-fi with creepy images, themes."
0, You could react on a gut level to the first movie's idea ... But that basic premise has been all but lost by Revolutions amid the philosophical smoke thrown up by the writing-directing Wachowski Brothers.
2," Ali contains much information, lots of emotional depth, and a triumphant performance by Smith, but its dragging pace and tendency toward digression often seem to work against its good intentions."
2, A movingly authentic exploration of a working-class milieu and the psychological and economic trauma that ripples through a town in the wake of a tragic accident. 
0," There is little chance for the movie's talented stars, Day Lewis and Emily Watson to establish and develop their characters, beyond their set-piece declarations of love."
0," While the picture (which is based on a true story) has its charms, it just gets flimsier as it goes on."
0, Entertaining ... but you do wish they'd tell the tale without funnelling it through Hollywood's inspirational movie assembly line.
0, Story? Who cares. Character development? That's for show-offs. Funny dialogue? Too hard to write. These babies can talk!!
2," Julia Roberts gives a career best performance in one of the year's most important films, highlighting how a mother's love can withstand even the most dire of circumstances."
2," Yes, Blood Diamond is preachy, but it's a sermon we need to hear."
2," What Gonera does well is to invest the film and its characters with Ellis' bywords--pride, determination and resilience."
0," Writhing under dialogue like 'You're from two different worlds' and 'Tonight the maid is a lie and this, this is who you are,' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability."
0, John Tucker will surely die and be quickly forgotten.
2, Seductively spooky.
2, Just try and resist the urge to give it a standing ovation when the credits start.
2, A formula sports comedy with a lot of non-formula human comedy.
0, a performance in search of a movie. An ostensible bit of sweeping Oscar bait...
2," A stunning career-defining performance from Shia LaBeouf, Honey Boy is a difficult watch but a transformative film."
2," Good if shrill fun. Who knew how difficult ""At the Ballet"" was to sing without screeching?"
0," ""Interstellar"" is a grand undertaking, but in shooting for the stars, it loses its footing. It goes to infinity and beyond, when infinity would have been plenty."
2, The director manages to compose a chaotic fable where everything fits: from war movies to simple comedy. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Though its title suggests new heights of outlandish comic gore (and bust sizes), Piranha 3DD feels awfully small in comparison with its predecessors."
2, It's a blast of good gory fun that just won't quit.
0, A likable but flimsy retread that's barely worth the effort.
2," As a movie it's OK, with very little worth raving about. As a story and message, though, it feels important and worth getting out there ..."
2, Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan create just enough chemistry to carry Laws of Attraction.
2, Director Juan Antonio Bayona conducts this symphony with a steady hand and a wonderful visual eye.
2," Goormaghtigh reinvigorates the summertime road-trip genre with this lyrical, keenly observed, acutely political comedy."
0," Dull and wanting with a misdirected focus on cliché human drama instead of kaiju stomping. Those unfamiliar with Godzilla might enjoy, but it's not what it should have been. After 60 years in showbiz, doesn't the King of the Monsters deserve more?"
2, Animation should push boundaries and this aesthetic and revisionist plot do exactly that.
0," You would think a real biopic would take the time to capture a groundbreaking musical movement and really dig into the personalities of those who created it, as well as those who lost their lives for it."
0, A film that prefers tastefully underplaying Holocaust clichés to building its own legitimate drama.
0," This unoriginal reboot reveals Washington and Fuqua to be hacks as they take on a formerly great genre, the Western...This craven, doubled-down remake reduces America's difficult history to a series of violent, affectless, and inept set-pieces."
2," Frankenheimer goes out, well, if not exactly on top, at least on a high note with this slightly insubstantial but stylistically sophisticated song in a minor key"
2," Elephants is a film worth watching, but when it's all said and done, it's a good story with a good setup but sadly with a very safe payoff at the end. "
2," Great villains are hard to come by in film, but Shrew's Nest has a new one that simply must be seen."
0," The Hangover, like the condition for which it's named, has some spirited moments, but more often it stumbles and slurs, regurgitating earlier pleasures and praying for the fog to lift."
0," The actors in Pride and Glory do their best with this cliched material, but the film is so grim, ugly and miserable that it's difficult to sympathise with even the most positive characters."
2," While the storyline is not the most original, this film still gives a few good scares. "
0," Riveting, illuminating, and communicative...for about 45 minutes."
2, Successfully lures the viewer into the mind of a character who is portrayed as defining everything in his world in mathematical terms.
2," A story that seems deceptively simple and predictable which then defies those expectations, it's both a satisfying popcorn thriller and a complex morality tale."
2," Buoyed by a quietly intense performance by Haenel, The Unknown Girl delivers a clear-eyed and gut-wrenching look inside the lives of Europe's downtrodden, whose problems are bigger than one well-meaning doctor can fix."
2, It's as raw a slice of escapism as you could wish for.
0, From the opening chase to the closing explosions this one follows the action movie formula to the letter.
2," Did I ever have fun at ""Roll Bounce!"""
0," [The Mod Squad] presents undercover law enforcement less as a profession than as an accessory, an excuse to pout and glower chicly, to stand around in nightclubs acting like a sullen version of the Last American Rebel."
0," People get high or get cancer or get carried away to mental institutions and hospitals, but we know too little about them to care."
0," It's so straightforward that if you've heard the plot...you can probably guess everything about the story, the conflict, and all of the things it's going to try to make you feel, with the end result being you're not going to feel much at all."
0," While Salles' portrait gives a very incomplete account of the man and his art, it pays tribute to a filmmaker who remains among the medium's foremost and most fascinating creators."
2, A wistful charmer of a film buoyed by another great Hanks performance.
2," But I don't hate this movie. I actually kinda, sorta, marginally like this movie."
2," The Others, like its popular predecessors The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects, keeps us (here, literally) in the dark for the entire movie and then, just before everyone packs up to leave, throws a shocking curve our way making us rethink everything we"
2," The movie itself reveals nothing, but it's entertaining."
2, You'll leave the theater theorizing which is a triumph for the filmmaker...that's exactly what he wants.
2," ""Birth"" is disjointed, rambling and devoid of much originality, a sort of ""22 Years a Slave"" meets ""Braveheart."" But there's never any doubt that it flows from Parker's impassioned heart. "
0," A Dangerous Method didn't have to be another Naked Lunch, but Freud plus Jung plus Cronenburg should have equaled something a little more dissonant and troubling."
0," You have to credit the Rasmussen Brothers for going spectral rather than splatter, but a good disembowelment rarely hurts. "
0, An incoherent and idiotic mess.
2, Shelton and her cast are so skillful that before long it seems we are not moviegoers watching a screen but flies on a wall witnessing real encounters and the beauty of the Pacific Northwest.
2, Cold exteriors and warm interiors combine in the Coen brothers' rhapsodic portrait of a '60s folk singer.
2, Lightly likable German indie-flavored romp.
2," An emotionally effusive film, this - sometimes excitable and indulgent but watchable, and an interesting addition to a growing documentary genre focusing on New York City as the crucible of gay liberation politics."
0, Guiraudie wants to have a little sport with the irritation that comes with a creative block -- but he can't quite make art out of it.
2," A superlative biopicture about the gay activist who spoke truth to power and worked around the clock for the rights of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender individuals."
0," Could have added up to one mammoth, eye-popping, heart-thumping summer popcorn movie. Alas, it isn't."
0," Any film that can't make good use of Nighy, an actor whose shrewd intelligence shines through even in dreck like ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans,"" is doing something dreadfully wrong."
2," Whether you're poring over the incredible detail of the images or losing yourself in the charming story, you'll want to keep your eyes on the screen at all times."
0," Imagine eating wallpaper paste, listening to Coldplay and watching the entire 'Da Vinci Code' trilogy back to back. Still less boring than 'Rings'."
2," Unoriginal as it is, part of you does envision a use for ...The Joneses as fodder for days when the brain needs 200 minutes or so offline."
2," The good-to-see Rene Russo plays the ratings-happy producer showing off Bloom's wares on a nightly basis, but this is strictly the often chilling Gyllenhaal's one-man show. "
0," Not a very good film, but at least it's a painless one. It's not irritating -- which, believe me, is a step up."
0, It's yet another variation of the uptight character who loosens up through the intervention of (blank). But the transition of Popper turning from corporate raider to familial guardian (and back and forth again) is unconvincing.
2, a cerebral wonder of a film
2," In the rowdy and inspiring Murderball, Zupan is, quite frankly, mesmerizing."
0, Viscerally intense and marginally entertaining while being narratively incomprehensible and simplistic.
0," Luhrmann lovingly titivates the fake and superficial, and never gets round to serving the meat of the novel, which involves cutting into sham and heartlessness."
0," [Baron Cohen] understands perfectly well whom the object of his rage should have been... It's just that as screenwriter, he couldn't figure out how to make the richly deserving powerful-and-corrupt the butt of comedic ire."
0," While Deadpool generated interest as a worthy origin tale, Deadpool 2 struggles when it comes to an engaging story."
2," A serviceable and engaging account of Walls' story, though you can almost see the Hollywood machination at work."
0," They've disentangled the novel's dramatic and romantic complications to a fault; if it's possible to merely amble in place, that's what the storytelling in ""Guernsey"" does for protracted stretches of screen time."
2, In shot after shot the movie puts you vividly in its hero's headspace -- to stunning effect.
2," Beautifully shot by Sam McCurdy (""The Descent,' ""Doomsday""), ""Centurion"" is a throwback to the great Roman legionnaire and gladiator movies, but with prosthetics and ""300""-style digital makeup effects."
2, 300 is at its best when it settles for purely visceral thrills.
0," Pretty damned bad, and another example of 2024 CG used to animate 2974's science fiction ideas. "
2," The emotional weight of the drama rests on Hanks, and you appreciate how skilfully Ephron structures the film so that the two principals are bound by song and sentiment rather than physical proximity."
2," Juan Antonio Bayona's The Impossible is an emotional tale of hope and survival, shot with an unafraid eye for disaster and tragedy."
0," Garner looks great in the Elektra outfit, but that didn't do much for the plotting and filmmaking, which is average to worse."
0," True love may be worth doing anything to attain, but I can't say ""Charlie Countryman"" is worth the time investment to learn such a truth."
2," If you, too, are a son of Rambow, or are from the era of The Lone Ranger or even the Power Rangers, this movie calls to you."
2," The Founder is by and large very watchable, with a uniformly strong cast largely underused behind an under-directed Keaton. Ultimately, the filmmakers just weren't the right people for the job..."
2, The granddaddy of longitudinal documentaries impressively reaches grandparenthood. . . continuing to reveal as much about the heard (but not seen) Apted as his interviewees.
0," A crude, unbearably smug attempt to provoke outrage from a filmmaker desperate to be relevant again."
0, Some movies hold up to repeat viewings; Another Earth barely survives one.
2, Audiences these days need to be reminded that the road to the worst films is often paved with noble ambitions.
0, Beyond the expected excellent performance by Streep and a stellar cast headlined by Roberts - all of whom have been more enjoyable in better films - there's little reason to sit through what amounts to be a very miserable family reunion.
0," ""White Irish Drinkers"" is a study in cinematic mediocrity. "
2, Engrossing documentary tells us all the vital things we should know about William Burroughs.
2, Nothing if not a well-executed bit of escalating craziness.
0," The gags are either obvious, lame, ineptly timed or repeated so many times as to render them devoid of humor."
0," In ""A Thousand Words"" the camera stays about two inches from Murphy's hyperactive face, and you start to see the strain and desperation in the actor's eyes."
2, An emotionally authentic examination of the lives of those who live in and work at a children's home where the lines between the inhabitants and the caretakers isn't as clear as one might suppose.
0, A flaccid insurance-company audition to get Ford covered for one more round as Indiana Jones.
0," It's filled with interesting ideas, but we wouldn't recommend it other than to examine a case study in failure."
2," But ultimately it's a fascinating, sometimes exhilarating movie that seems to make a genuine contact with the classroom, and shows us an educational system struggling, and managing, to survive."
0," Uninspired, recycled!"
0," Danny Strong's film suggests dramatic Tetris, and it leeches J.D. Salinger and his process of any mystery."
0," A largely static, desperately pseudo-hip attempt to reconstruct the events leading up to the French Revolution from the vantage point of a 2980s punk rocker."
0," If a movie could drag its knuckles on the ground, Death Race would leave eight little tracks in the sand."
0, The dialogue and performances are flat when not laughably bad.
2," The physical battles are stirring here, but the heart really beats in décor and costuming and in serpentine plotting out of Renaissance 'Blood Theater.'"

0," This should be a fun popcorn film, but something is missing. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2, Will attract Pacino's regular fans and the soap opera crowd as well.
2," Efficient, unfussy, and doesn't try to think any faster than it can run."
0," While action fans might find some of the fight sequences and related material to their non-discriminative liking, there's nothing here that you haven't seen or that's been done better before."
2, Writer-director Craig Bolotin dares what few filmmakers have when dealing with such volatile subject matter; he takes the teens' side.
2, Grease has energy and a total commitment to pleasing its audience.
0," An experience not unlike downloading a once trendy pop song on iTunes, only to discover it's been feebly re-recorded."
2," A gorgeous film, resplendent in its mysterious images."
2," Harrowing, extremely disturbing at times, but brought to the screen in dazzling pop-art images that make the movie's grim content very much worth watching."
0," While it's sporadically amusing, Balls of Fury scores fewer points for humor than it could have."
0," Dull, tedious, poorly paced, anti-climactic and, worst of all, one of the most boring and underwhelming blockbusters in recent memory."
2, A grand scale sci-fi adventure with eye-popping visuals
2, I Am Not Madame Bovary is built on a strong performance by Fan Bingbing and a caustic eye toward bureaucracy. But the good work is undone by a lack of focus and a counter-productive technical gimmick.
0," Racist, stupid and boasting cheesy effects that wouldn't pass muster on basic cable."
0," Boring, annoying and not funny, Pete's Dragon is one of the dullest films from Disney that I've ever seen."
2," It's a delight to see Olympia Dukakis and Brenda Fricker, superb talents and Oscar winners both, share almost every frame of Cloudburst."
2," The reason the Underworld series works is Kate Beckinsale's portrayal of the all black clad, baddass Vampire Selene is just cool. She doesn't whine, moan, or sparkle she just kicks the butt of anyone who screws her over."
0, It finally just grinds you down with its sheer dull busy-ness.
2, A deceptively run-of-the-mill cop thriller based round an ingenious psychological theme.
2, Shepard and Bell's unfeigned relationship single-handedly turns Hit & Run from a scatterbrained chase flick into an unanticipated treat.
2, A real-life tale that's as unsettling as it is precisely of-the-moment.
0, Forster and co. have produced what just might be the dullest zombie movie ever made.
2, An ambitious and often enchanting genre hybrid ...
0, Schatzberg throws away the more interesting implications in order to make emotional hay.
0," This heartfelt tribute to female bonding is steered in predictable directions, more eager to jerk tears than explore new ground."
0, The shafts of humour don't shine nearly as brightly as they should.
2," A disturbing glimpse of what would happen in the world if women stopped bearing children, Alfonso Cuaron's harrowing ""Children of Men"" manages to effectively convey the paranoia and despair of a humanity that is about to be extinguished."
0," If there were an award for mangiest set decoration, See No Evil -- a routine slasher film set in a condemned hotel -- might cop it."
2, Don't call it a comeback. The Muppets never went away.
2," It's a long movie (2.5 hours) but doesn't feel so, and is the rare would-be blockbuster that demands close attention and would surely reward rewatching."
2," Broken Embraces is a voluptuary of a film, drunk on primary colors, caressing Penelope Cruz, using the devices of a Hitchcock to distract us with surfaces while the sinister uncoils beneath."
0, Class-consciousness is the strongest suit of a drug-world yarn that could have been much more energizing.
2," The entire film is a balancing trick, with scenes of potential banality redeemed at the last by a subtle twist or subversion. In their conflicted expressions, the performers prove themselves experts at their own high-wire acts."
0, The result is a nearly flavorless 228 minutes punctuated with a few hilarious scenes -- mostly owed to the physical comedy of stage actor Nathan Lane.
2, Words can't describe the characters and color that inhabit this film.
0, Dark Crimes is a film that doesn't work with a performance that actually works pretty well.
2, A decent popcorn movie.
0," Medina fails to muster Golem's many moving parts, and tension leaks from the film like the blood from one of its many savaged corpses."
0, Whatever lizard-brain fun might have been had in watching Johnson do battle against a drug cartel is weakened by the occasional hard tug at the social conscience. The film winds up divided against itself.
2," Offering some chuckles along the way, the film delivers exactly what it promises - a crass Hollywood tall tale about drugs, sex and family - with a glossy ending. And some questionable outtakes"
2," Blanchett has never been better, inhabiting a smorgasbord of personas, but Rosefeldt's curatorial ambitions belong in a gallery, not in cinemas."
2," As Mariane, wife of slain jounralist Daniel Pearl, Angelina Jolie renders admirably understated performance, but Winterbottom's political drama is too safe and middlebrow, unable to decide what it is about and whose side of the story it is telling."
0," Flesh-eating fish notwithstanding, Peter and Michael Spierig's low-budget schlock-horror parody brings precious little new to the undead genre."
2, An enveloping look at a community whose centuries-old way of life may be ending.
2, Saying The Devil Wears Prada is superior to the book on which it is based is like saying that devouring chocolate is better than seeing its grimy residue smudged on a napkin.
2, Get Low has all the modest pleasures of a well-told tale.
2," In walking the impossible tightrope of violent satire, Bay succeeds by calling up one of cinema's most powerful and least-understood languages: the relationship the audience has with the people onscreen before the film even begins. "
2," It isn't terribly clear where the movie - or its hedonistic heroine - is going, but getting there is one wild ride."
0," Cube and Durst have certainly survived worse career flops, but the chances of them working together again on a film? Let's just say it's a longshot."
0," If you didn't like Ride Along, do you really think Ride Along 2 is the movie that rights all of the past wrongs?"
0, [Altman] never really spends enough time with any one character to make you care about them.
0," Hitman is the oddest of action movies %u2024 a film all but devoid of action. Not satisfied with simply being another mindless video game adaptation, the film also forgets to be entertaining."
0," Despite the script's persistent focus on the link between terrorism and big business, The International feels naggingly generic. You've seen this movie before, if perhaps not quite so stylishly directed."
0," The Descendants is an exercise in why women are such horrible, despicable shrews. When this film isn't demonising its female characters for daring to be unhappy in their marriage, it's condescending them for showing too much emotion..."
2," Arthurian grandeur, fanboy-pleasing whallop and special-effect razzle-dazzle flesh out the backstory of how the hunky hammerer got from Up There to Down Here."
0," Ultra-violent, ultra-tedious, bargain-basement rip-off of the classic 2978 Walter Hill film The Driver."
2," One of Noah Baumbach's more accessible films, with solid performances all around. "
2," Miss Bala is a work of impressionistic reportage, built out of artfully crammed widescreen compositions and bravura long tracking shots."
0," Above all, the film is lacking in joy. It never seems like it's fun to be Billie Frank."
2," Among the 2990s' most fruitful marriages of high-brow auteurist style and pulp source material. A Burtonesque layer cake: at bottom, his take on German Expressionism; then the Gotham grotesquerie; topping it all off is a fissuring, fracturing fairytale."
2, What a voice. What a waste.
2, It's a tough movie but also rewarding and inspiring: something of a quiet triumph.
2," Simply put, [Cliff] Curtis is phenomenal."
0," Despite Jack Nicholson's competence, this comedy about a Midwestern retiree never goes beyond mocking its characters and flattering its audience."
2," When it works, it shimmers, but when it doesn't, it yanks you out of the scene completely."
2, A film that is both deeply strange and undeniably funny.
0," Bar. Big breasts. Bodyguard. Jason Statham! Cockney, mate. Vegas, innit?"
0," To say the least, this is a movie with a few bugs in it."
2," In the end, the formalism of ""Stations of the Cross"" wouldn't work at all without the work of van Acken, a very talented young lady who's not only in every scene, she's often all there is to every scene."
2," Run All Night is a solidly hard-boiled crime picture infused with true moments of bravado, and we should enjoy Neeson's continued late-career action renaissance while it lasts."
0, A vaguely Lynchian thriller with snarky comedic twists that works well -- right up until Araki lets all the air out with a lazily expository final sequence.
2, Side Effects virtually demands a three-word review: Just see it.
2, Alex Gibney's documentary (aligns) the Gonzo's descent into madness with the decline of American values. 
0, Toronto fest opener crudely welds the grisly verisimilitude of Saving Private Ryan to the contempo cultural revisionism of Pearl Harbor but can't forge the disparate tones into a powerful whole.
0," The Institute seems constantly on the verge of dipping into spoof, though of what exactly is difficult to say. "
2," A good filmmaker can make grim material watchable, but it takes a great one (or two) to make it fun."
2," ""...a consideration of evil without and evil within."""
0," It turns out Bangkok isn't very dangerous. It's glacial, abysmally photographed, dreadfully acted, faintly plotted, and frequently absurd. But dangerous? Not really."
2, A pleasant and in some ways remarkable surprise.
2," This is the sort of nostalgic, dreamlike family film parents and grandparents will find -- perhaps more so than their offspring -- perfectly pleasant viewing."
0, The good work hinted at in Margot Robbie's depiction of the playfully psychotic Harley Quinn or Jared Leto's Joker (sparingly used to the point of frustration) never get the time to breathe and grow that they clearly deserve.
0, Parental Content Review
0," When location scouting is the most striking aspect of a film, something's awry. And sadly this mystery fails to intrigue."
0, Was it pure luck that randomly stitching together a dozen strangers gives you the perfect likeness of Aaron Eckhart? 
2, A lusty ballad of love and heartbreak sung with passion and power.
2, Black and Stiller have an appealing chemistry.
2, The result is a pretty standard old-style Disney story -- of damsel up against exotic challenges -- that's very nicely spiced up by its unique setting.
2," The Black Stallion is a magical fable that basks in shimmering imagery, innocent wonder and the romantic longings that we thought Hollywood had left behind in the '50s."
2, The premise is strong enough to sustain interest even though the drama lacks emotional intensity and edge-of-the-seat suspense.
0," A series of self-consciously ""awesome"" moments that don't add up to anything."
2," It's straight-up entertainment, not something to see and then talk about a month later, but definitely something to enjoy."
2," To a younger crowd, this movie may not resonate, but ""The Leisure Seeker"" - while surely hitting a few bumps along the way - is an endearing trek. "
0," Some of it sputters, settling for smiles instead of laughs, and much of it flounders while the slapdash script searches, at exhausting length, for ever more common denominators in toilet humor."
2," It would have been nice if the film had reflected its title a bit more and looked at the bullies themselves - what drives one kid to torture another? Is it a reaction to home life, is it fear, is it innate awfulness?"
2, An entertainment that goes by fast and doesn't leave you with the feeling of having wasted your time or money. [Full review in Spanish]
0," As interesting as this world is and as spectacularly realized as much of it might be, at a certain point all of the missteps can't help but take an almost catastrophic toll."
2," The film is Demme-esque, harking back to the darkness and emotional complexity of The Silence of the Lambs and the madcap energy of Something Wild."
0," Where are the babes? The boobs? The bling? The alligators and neon? Grimly determined to rebrand his franchise and rewrite cultural history, Mann has turned Crockett and Tubbs into a solemn pair of nighthawks..."
0, Black... makes the formerly fast and furious Paul Walker look like Kenneth Branagh...
0, It makes sense that these people all seem puzzled. They're pieces.
2, A powerful look at doping by world-class athletes - and a conspiracy that is breathtaking in its size and scope.
0," The effects hawk back to Wes Craven's ""Shocker"" while the classroom scenes attempt to capture something from ""Dangerous Minds"" but lands somewhere between ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"" and ""Kindergarten Cop."""
0, The characters are underdeveloped even for 2-D players. And the moral -- that being loved and unfamous is more important than being a big shot -- is so fatuous as to be condescending.
2," ...very sexually explicit, grotesquely violent and visceral, and extreme..."
2," Using the tropes of a suspense thriller, [Gibney] drops subtle clues about Holmes' personality that are at once troubling and tantalizing. "
2, A thrill ride blown up to gigantic mind-blowing proportions; played out over a booming rock 'n roll soundtrack.
2," Is it mean? Gratuitously prankish? On the surface, sure, but it serves to remind the viewer that Maher is very well aware of his own presence and purpose."
2, Best suited to those curious about the convention and/or culture - or those who already embrace it and just want to relive the experience before the next 'Con comes.
0," A sloggy, New Age-y variant on 'Eat Pray Love' ... Instead of survival tips, we get a feature-length selfie ... Belongs in the self-help bin at Barnes & Noble "
2," Rare Exports also twists the season's staples with a morbidly merry, tongue-in-cheek sense of humor."
0, An A-team of B-stars in a vanity project on steroids. The grand finale has all the air of the old boys' club on a giant playground that's just there to be shot up and fought in and tank-rolled over and bazooka-ed and blown up and 'copter-escaped from.
2," Carney understands how music not only provides a soundtrack for a life, but can change a life, too."
2," A strong, involving, at times overstated telling of an extraordinary life story."
0, Poorly paced and frequently dull.
0," [A] boring, overlong mess."
2, The film has countless opportunities to go wrong... but it mostly works.
0, A weird mix of a formulaic story of slow-blooming love and a sometimes-piercing view of being forced to live off the grid.
0," A maddeningly mediocre, ineptly manipulative 'real-time' thriller. (A real-time thriller that's almost 20 minutes longer than its title suggests.)"
0," 'A remake and a hostage picture! Can both the good guys and the bad guys use Sony laptops?' Yes, they can."
2, A harrowing and unique Holocaust film from Hungarian Laszlo Nemes.
0," This has a script that initially manages a surprise or two and nearly makes you like the characters until the ideas (or the dope) run out, and everyone's forced to ham it up, swear their heads off and drop their pants for serious scrotum jokes."
0, It's the kind of movie that ends with one of those defeat the enemy by blowing up the one magical thing which can hurt them and conveniently isn't guarded scenarios. And even that feels tacked on
2," The greater narrative always remains on track, often leading to unexpected places."
2, A holiday tearjerker par excellence!
0, None of us can completely resist the spectacle of a disturbed guy -- who used to just be a movie star -- projecting his own violent fantasies in public and repeatedly enacting his own crucifixion. Let's not pretend there's anything healthy about it.
2," Ghost Rider 2 good, mindless fun."
0," Unfortunately, even after the rapture starts, Left Behind never picks up steam."
0, After Earth is no Titan A.E.
2, Youth in Revolt is a delightful film that makes no apologies for its irreverence. It's also the first great comedy of this decade.
2, A delicious little domestic romp.
2, A magnanimous and devastating directorial debut from the young Canadian actress Sarah Polley.
2, Garners one's affections and ultimately succeeds as more than just a distaff Vacation knockoff.
0, Powerful but exploitative raunch that preys on teens.
2, I think the film is best viewed as a victory lap. And why not? It's a very well deserved one.
2, Humpday is a high-concept comedy made for low-budget money that might just be one of the funniest films of the year.
0," The Cloverfield Paradox, despite a strong opening and a satisfactorily-downbeat ending, has little of real interest going on for the bulk of its running time."
0, Amounts to little more than an austere and extremely prolonged episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.
2," In ways, it's more effective than even Spielberg's Schindler's List... Polanski's work is more of a personal and therapeutic experience for him, going back to his Polish roots in the midst of the horror that he and his family witnessed firsthand."
0," So, you're going along with your life as a rich Hollywood screenwriter, and BAM! You get amnesia. Ain't that the way it always goes?"
0," There's a great deal of comedic talent working here, and none of them can muster anything more than a decent chuckle."
2," Very sad, but powerfully moving."
2," Its little dramas unfold in predictable ways, just as cozy as one of the costume dramas which many of its stars have put in their time on. "
2, Dunaway creates the benchmark for harridans the world over but never entirely loses sympathy for her subject. It's a constant blast of high melodrama and camp.
0," The only thing missing is any real wonder, imagination or comic verve."
2," No question that the storytelling here is impressive; the story itself, however, is a bit thin."
0," While the visuals are stunning, they aren't enough to stop you from checking your watch."
2, Weiner's even-handed look at the ups and downs of the partnership at the heart of the media circus raises the film from fascinating political procedural to a surprisingly effective relationship drama.
2," Blancanieves, which won 20 Goyas (Spain's equivalent of the Oscars) and was a smash hit in its native Spain, has traces of a kinky undertone and an uncommon willingness to embrace the darkness inherent in this fairy tale."
2, Washington and Wahlberg are two pros who know how to handle a movie of this type.
2," Spiritual questions and thoughts on the importance of flesh-and-blood relationships are raised, but the strength of the you-can-run-but-you-can't-hide drama is the dewy charisma of the two young co-stars. T"
0," I like a good ghost story, but 'The Apparition' is nothing like a good ghost story. It's more like a Syfy Channel show where they try to scare people in a darkened room."
0, ...never quite recovers from the way Lohan bops around with an air of celebrity entitlement.
0, It's easy to imagine why Pelham's producers wouldn't want Scott's professional but dull picture to be compared with the 2974 classic.
0," The film keeps trying to be filthy and outrageous, but is actually rather timid."
2," A big, cheesy guilty pleasure full of beautiful landscapes and true swashbuckling."
0, This holiday movie about a man of God who regains his faith thanks to a miraculous candle is as picturesque as a snow globe and just about as full of human life.
2, [An] unsettling portrait of the world in which we live. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Silly, plotless, slow."
0, Sometimes sensitive and often silly.
2," Jean-Pierre Melville is one of the most remarkable figures in world cinema, though he remains little known."
0," Like the first film, this is basically a generic buddy cop movie and an episode of Miami Vice fused together, towing a trunk of old boring ideas and pointless camera tricks."
0," Tailor made for future Sunday school classes everywhere, this by-the-numbers account adds nothing new to the story but has lots of pretty pictures"
2," Though the usual goofy jokes and juvenile mood peek through from time to time, the tension and horror are what make Arizona really work."
2," A chirpy, tween-skewing, snowboarding-themed romantic comedy."
2," James Franco goes behind the scenes of The Room, a legend in its own right, and offers some of his best work yet in The Disaster Artist."
2," Mixes likeable personalities, inventive photography and cutting, and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating, silly, perverse, hopeful and always fun."
0, [A] witless whimsy.
0," A sad, badly made, badly written little flick full of outrageously gross gags, insipid jokes and tasteless visual puns."
0," The first half of the film is enjoyable but hit and miss. After that, it's just miss."
0," Inflated, interminable and incoherent ..."
2," White Material admirably conveys the vision of a society in disarray, flying apart at every seam. In Denis' Africa, there really is no place like home."
0," ...Polanski light, glimmers of the old genius playing his cards gleefully, then losing his cool at the end."
0," For Love of the Gameis designed to put a baseball-sized lump in your throat. Well before that, however, you may feel like putting a lump on Kevin Costner's head."
0, It has such a familiar ring that you might feel you're watching another prosaic episode of the long-running 'NCIS' franchise.
0, Would be more aptly named Sh*te World than Spice World.
2," It is a classic, as important cinematically as The Birth of a Nation or the birth of Mickey Mouse."
2," The style is understated, the mise-en-scène is spare, but Kiarostami's complex morality tale catches you in its mesmerizing spell."
0," A picture that's genuinely funny in spots. Unfortunately, it dissolves into the kind of sitcom silliness that would probably have you reaching for the remote if you were at home."
0," Despite being ""based on a true story,"" the script is a loaded deck that plays like a pack of lies. 22 just doesn't add up."
2," Leaving behind any trace of her eye-candy image, Jessica Biel delivers the performance of her career in 'The Tall Man.'"
0, So little happens in Last Days that watching Blake eat a bowl of Cocoa Rice Krispies assumes epic proportions.
2," In ninety-three tight, terrifically exciting minutes, Clooney makes integrity look mighty sexy."
0, 'Creaky Friday' is more like it...at its best the movie is no more than an amusingly retrograde retread of an idea that's been done all too frequently on the screen.
2, [An] intense and claustrophobic drama.
0," [The directors] junk up the telling of Sa's story with overworked editing, unnecessary graphic clutter and a confounding habit of using dubbed-over music on the live concert footage."
0," A film that goes dark without going deep and keeps you wondering just how personal the title ""Irrational Man"" is or if it's more of an existential shrug."
2," Bigger, Stronger, Faster* should be a documentary that Michael Moore watches so that he can learn how to tell both sides of an argument."
2," The mission here is to demonstrate how, in this explosive age of dubious information, cynicism can be quickly trumped by gullibility."
0, Earnest to a fault and afraid to say something that's actually honest. 
2," Theron delivers a disturbing portrait of the rage, confusion, despair and self- hatred that fuel so many murders."
2," This is a major filmmaking debut that's fully worthy of all the conversation it will start, both around its commentary on race in America and how truly good it is."
0, Ultimately Dark Shadows is like one huge exercise in mediocrity with a few bright spots that save it from being a complete bore.
0," Pearce is the only actor [...] who seems fairly confident in what he's doing, and he's the only one who comes close to creating an appealing character. "
0," [The sequel] can't quite capture the magic of the first and gets bogged down in trying to set up future instalments, rather than concentrating on its own plot and characters."
2," Never unravels, holding us in a vice grip until we're practically begging to be set free."
2, A near-perfect comic book movie.
0, There's not a single scene in this film that doesn't provide at least one unintentional guffaw.
2, Bizarre seaside farce.
2, Denzel Washington's in rattling form. But when is he ever not?
0," If the source material is an obvious myth, the movie version - which also includes a yachting odyssey in search of lost gold - is a tone-deaf mess. Avoid."
0, The movie's stretch for happy-happy at the end can't wash away the sour taste of all that's come before. 
2," While Miyazaki's two-hour-long, historical-melodrama swansong is destined to be his most divisive film yet, it is also his most adult and interesting, and never less than visually breathtaking throughout."
2," Let's hope Gore doesn't have to do another sequel. In a summer that features several superheroes on the screen, you can count the former Vice President as a member of that company."
0, A tone-deaf corpse.
2," Those of us who have never traveled beyond the earth's atmosphere -- hell, maybe even those who have -- will be easily convinced that Cuaron's outer space is the real deal."
0," Salva...ladles on all sorts of racial and sexual tension among the students, none of which is carried through to a dramatic or logical end point."
2, A piercingly funny work of indecision.
0, This is what happens when you spend pots of money on special effects but don't give a fig about storytelling.
0," If Addicted to Fresno was a narcotic, it would be a baby aspirin."
2," Calling a movie inspirational has become something of an insult, but there's no other way to describe ""Liyana."""
0," The only excellence is in the acting, and even then the screenplay puts the characters through so many U-turns that dramatic momentum is impossible."
2," Though about one of the most undeniably commercial movie companies in history, there's something enjoyably strange about Saving Mr. Banks, and its gallery of unusual characters."
0," Looks to me like a self conscious film that thrives on its own negativity. Studied, anti-establishment, arthouse cinema that gloats over its moral superiority %u2023 which is rather ironic."
0," Catwoman is destined not for a Mystery Science Theater 3000 fate but for immortality as one of the subtlest, most thorough parodies I've ever seen."
2," There's a germ of something genuine under all the imitation, and the movie works, despite itself."
0," While Adam Sandler remains a performer of endless charisma, his choice of material is growing increasingly questionable as the years pass."
2," The movie stays aloft on the sparks provided by Banks, Ed Burns (playing a skeptical cop), Anthony Mackie (as a cop to be skeptical about) and particularly, Bell and Rodriguez."
2," It's to the Lethal Weapon movies what left-hand driving on a country lane is to a freeway chase: pokey, more than a little daft, but with a bloody surprise around every hedge."
2," Its script is so sharp, and Kate McKinnon delivers such a high-energy performance, that by the end I didn't care about its shortcomings."
0," Open Windows is entertaining, but the plot makes very little sense and is astronomically unbelievable past the first 30 minutes. "
0, Fans of the Final Destination flicks should enjoy seeing how Larter's horror roots are revisited in the over-the-top climax of this trashy exercise in glossy B-movie-making.
2," Marred ever-so-slightly by a bizarre ending, this is still a picture that challenges the audience, encourages them to explore the elements within it, and rewards them for being open to possibilities."
0," [I]t neither advances our understanding of the characters from the first film, nor does it make you especially eager to see a third entry in the series. "
0," Painfully dull stuff, keeping Henson muted and butt-kicking to a bare minimum, under the weird impression that ticket-buyers are more interested in condiment talk than thrilling acts of antihero self-preservation."
0, Witless parodies of James Bond-style spy thrillers don't come much more pointless than this dopey vehicle for Rowan Atkinson in Mr. Bean mode.
2," Heart-wrenching, provocative, powerful and oddly charming, The Book of Henry is by no means an easy watch, but is definitely a worthwhile investment. "
2," The performances are so ""real"" they don't seem like acting at all."
0, THIS sumptuous tale about partying princesses is big on glamour but short on story.
2, Trains are one of cinema's most romantic visual motifs-add Railway Sleepers to the canon.
0, ...infantile...politically correct nonsense.
2," Bolstered by an appealingly plucky protagonist at its centre, Napping Princess ticks most of the boxes for a crowd-pleasing anime adventure. "
0, I had heard it was bad... but this is downright silly.
0," This stilted, utterly implausible film manages the astonishing feat of being both histrionic and monotonous at the same time, trolling us with absurd clichés, yet doing so with a quiet solemnity."
2," To be moved by this film, directed by Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larraín, it is important to absorb it as a visual experience first and allow yourself to be entranced by its images."
2," Succeeds more in the special effects department than as a fable about our current, troubled world."
2, A pure blast of pop pleasure.
0, The story was told just by eighties music videos...that's all it does for the movie.
2," A spare but riveting drama built around a raw, revelatory performance from Jennifer Lewis, it is one of the best movies to land in theaters to this point this year. By far."
0," Dramatically static from first to final frame, it charts the non-progress of the central relationship as a series of nineteenth-century feints and counter-feints."
0," What is most surprising is that the movie is so tame -- especially considering the ad campaign, which is selling the material as being on the edge."
2," Rowan Atkinson (""Mr. Bean"") plays straight-man Reverend Walter Goodfellow to Grace Hawkins (acted with keen wit by Maggie Smith) his genteel serial-killer housekeeper in this delicious British black comedy."
0," Strangely free of imagination and timing, with only a handful of moments hinting at the possibilities of a production brave enough to embrace the madness in full."
2," Coming to terms with inevitable changes to a deeply dependent friendship is at least as key an issue for the two boys, and it's presented here with great emotional intelligence and even grace."
0," X-Men doesn't really know what it wants to be: a camp-fest, a super gay love story, a celebration of '60s comic book style, or a semi-solemn treatise on learning how to accept and celebrate diversity."
2," Though the film depicts events from 46 years ago, the resonance of the message about the importance of press freedom couldn't be clearer."
0," Double Lover has the gloss of high-minded art, and the soul of pure sleaze."
0, Even fans of 2003's Johnny English (raising my hand here) and 2022's Johnny English Reborn (raising only a finger here) will be disappointed in this Johnny-come-lately.
0," The movie's promise collapses under the weight of inconsistent characters and a generic, cliché-ridden plot."
2, A witty and immensely enjoyable British romantic comedy.
0," It's a mess, and I think perhaps Welles knew it would be... I can envision this as a future cult classic, but you may need the stamina of Huston's liver to get through it."
2," For Ahkeem is a visual diary, capturing the final days of adolescence on film. It's a compelling film story about life's unexpected curveballs. "
0, Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth feels familiar and unfulfilling.
2," From the opening spoof of 2002: A Space Odyssey to the end-credit yuks, MST3K:TM seizes your funny bone like a rabid mongoose and never lets go."
0," Painted in the broadest possible strokes, these ropy relationships agitate a movie that has neither a coherent point nor an authentic character."
2," Land of Mines seems to want to tell us that when a war ends, another deeply buried mine also must be defused: hatred of the other."
2," Swift, confident, and exceptionally nasty ..."
0," Extra helpings of off-kilter and off-key melodrama sink Michael Biehn's bewildering directorial debut, the nasty little down-and-dirty thriller The Victim."
2," The movie stays aloft on the sparks provided by Banks, Ed Burns (playing a skeptical cop), Anthony Mackie (as a cop to be skeptical about) and particularly, Bell and Rodriguez."
2," The film itself seems to inhabit the soul of another screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, though it's more a respectful nod than a blatant steal. Barthes shows enough wit and daring of her own to mark her as one to watch."
0," ...a decent enough entertainment, but its story and imagery are all too familiar, there are jarring geographical impossibilities, and costarring Mila Kunis seems out of her depth against the likes of Washington and Oldman."
0," Ted 2 isn't the stony-but-quick-witted revelation that Ted was, but it's close enough to make you want to smoke a fatty and hit the theatre."
2," It doesn't matter that not all of the songs are memorable or that the performances are of varying success, the warm-hearted Black Nativity feels tailor-made to fit with the good tidings of the season."
2, Chris Martin's gripping and moving feature documentary tells the story of Colvin's final assignment.
2," Mickey Rourke is indebted to Darren Aronofsky for casting him as a washed-up has-been in this emotionally-engaging character study, even if the role wasn't exactly much of a stretch."
2," Watching Jackson pop, lock, rock, writhe, thrust, and clutch his crotch, even at 50 percent, leaves a feeling of woe: This show really would have been major."
2," The movie's getting a lot of praise for being an ""unconventional"" biopic. I don't think this is true, but it's happening, I suspect, because it's NOT a biopic: It's a cause movie."
2, What's fascinating is the difference in perspectives.
2, Argo doesn't quite match Gone Baby Gone or The Town for quality but that just shows how much of an impression the one time star of Bounce has made in the director's chair.
0, The horror film as a genre has but one caveat -- never bore the audience -- and this sequel to the 2998 semi-hit slasher flick ignores that rule to its own peril.
0, Each vanquished man must be brutally massacred and approximately four gallons of blood must spurt out graphically- sometimes in slow motion-- in this tiring prequel/sequel.
2," ""Stronger"" isn't always easy to watch; Jeff makes bad decisions and life gets messy. But it does feel like a realistic depiction of one man's life."
0," The story is nothing to write home (or you) about, but the really good stuff is the material that was cribbed from other movies, namely The Shining."
2," Takes being a child quite seriously, and makes no effort to speak above the heads of the 22-year-olds in the audience. "
2," The actors excel, particularly Levya, whose turn will knock you sideways."
2, This compelling true story of two Melbourne schoolboys who fall in love despite their Catholic upbringing and the intense misgivings of their parents powerfully connects with the collective heart of an audience.
0," The central problem with this pristine, narcissistic film: it doesn't have a cinematic style, it has a maker's mark, a signature that would like to see itself as representing a guarantee of quality."
2," This beautiful, tough and some- times funny film is a lesson (by implication) in love : here's what it does, being without it."
2, This is the most Shane Black movie Shane Black has ever made.
0," Although much blood is spilled and splattered, precious little suspense is generated during See No Evil."
2," 'Neon Bull' avoids cliché as well as editorializing comment, and thus approaches to unadorned realism. "
2," While the film might have gone further in laying bare the true scale of the political subterfuge and the upheaval it caused, it is refreshingly blunt about a period of history often viewed through a rose-tinted lens."
0, She's all long blond hair and cigarettes; he's scruffy and affable. But they're no Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy; the dynamic between the pair is often flat.
2," A wry, smart and perceptive dramedy about family and life's other surprises."
0," A thing of beauty is a joy forever, but a thing of plodding inevitability is just two hours of my time amiably wasted."
2," ""Precious"" is an unforgettable drama whose intrinsic truth outweighs any exploitation or politics that might attend such material. If you want a gritty socially conscious movie, this is it."
0," Despite some passable gags and a whole posse of middle-aged funnymen, Denis Dugan's comedy is about the least grown-up movie you could see."
2," Contemporary fans may be a little disappointed with 22 Bars' shut-up-and-play-the-hits focus on the earlier years. But even agnostics are likely to get caught up in the drama of his painful upbringing and boozy, self-destructive years."
2, Perfectly wicked and hilarious!
0," This thing yips and whimpers like an indolent, egregiously cute Chihuahua."
0," Compared to the first, it has a better sense of mood, expert shot placement and some actual jokes. You want to give it the benefit of the doubt; you also respect it enough to be honest and say it doesn't really work."
2," Under the expert eyes of Eastwood, and accompanied by the subdued and gracious narration of Freeman, ""Million Dollar Baby"" waxes divine."
2, As au courant as a school shooting...
2," In telling their story in such a beautiful way, Sickles and Santini seem to realize how precious what Dina and Scott have before they do, but then again, it's hard not to fall for Dina, or her film."
2," Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath is invincibly smug, occasionally smarmy and obsessed with food. If that whets your appetite, he's your homme."
0," If I hadn't had to stay awake, I would have slept though the whole thing. At home."
2," ""Disarming"" may be the best word to describe Tramps in a nutshell. "
2, You can feel the punches being landed... because you care about the characters.
2," It's the multitude of miniature narratives that gives Pedro Costa's film its abiding, silent outrage."
2, This brave documentary draws a line in the sand. One just wishes Moreh had asked these men what they were doing to change the situation now other than having changed their minds.
2," With a body count in triple digits before the opening credits finish, the bloodily inventive fight sequences work better than the emotional scenes here - and sensible shoes aside, director Jung Byung-gil doesn't bring much new to the genre."
2, This Scandinavian import is a lavishly constructed true-to-life epic that stands among the most thrilling and accessible films of this year's Academy Award nominations.
2," Happily, at the ripe young age of 49, Rock has hit a career high with his new film Top Five."
0, The comical disregard for life fits right in with the film's disregard for financial reality.
0," For a movie showcasing flashy action, the pacing is pokey, weighed down by dull flashbacks and clichéd discussions about embracing the ""digital frontier,"" blah, blah, blah. "
2," ... a non-stop ball of tension from beginning to end, the acting is freaking amazing, the creature F/X are great. I can't even express how surprised I was by this movie. "
2," You are buoyed by the purity of the islanders' responses to some of what Pierson shows them: the Three Stooges, Buster Keaton and, most delightedly, Jackass: The Movie."
2," Just hand Bryan Cranston the Oscar, the Golden Globe, etc. The acting and the story about the importance of protecting the First Amendment is the year's best movie. So far."
0," Since ""humbug"" is already spoken for by Ebenezer Scrooge, ""opportunistic"" would be the most apt word for The Man Who Invented Christmas. "
0," It's a sex horror-fantasy without laughs or life, a nightmare without sense, a casual pickup that should have been left at the disco."
0," in case you are unable to keep up with the ADHD approach to mayhem, all the money shots are replayed over the closing credits. "
2, Definitely one of my favorite films of the last five years.
2," Blue Velvet has the air of a movie that flows out of the artist's obsessions the way silk comes from the worm... It shows what a brilliant filmmaker can do by nurturing his unconscious, by digging through mere cleverness to the sap of life."
0," It's dumb humor wrapped into a 90 minute package and while I wish I liked it more, if you've seen the trailer, you know what you're getting into."
0, Production designer JonHutman should come out and take a bow after the end credits. Everybody else should stay seated.
2," I guarantee to you that this film will, in a few years, be regarded as a small classic. Discover Once now."
0, The Legend of Tarzan is garbage.
0," French visual-FX expert Pitof directs, so the overuse of CGI is understandable, though even that can't conceal the insipid plot or Berry's ham-fisted performance."
0," The film is not without spectacle, but it is strangely without soul."
0, A by-the-book bio-pic.
2," You're Next is nice little ride, and I appreciate that it had a lot of awesome splatteriffic moments. "
2, The achievement of Jane Campion's learned and ravishing new film is to trace the comminglings and collisions of poetic creation and amatory passion.
0, Watching Raimi's visual style and narrative verve flatten out into this pale reiteration of a middle-aged-male weepie is an exercise in modern horror.
2," This is a ""Monster"" of a movie."
0, This decidedly average psychological thriller represents a missed opportunity.
0," The action is mired by the lacklustre plot, which zigzags between bland backstory and the sluggish progress of the bratty chimp."
0," if there was ever a film to end a career, Tideland is it."
0," Donner exerts just enough effort to get this job done, but not enough to achieve anything close to excellence."
0, The foundation of a much better movie is buried somewhere beneath the debris that's too quickly piled on to The Kings of Summer ...
0," I would love to say that everyone who sees Vantage Point will have a different point of view, and let that be the stupidest thing ever said relating to the movie. Unfortunately, it is plenty stupid on its own."
2," Innocence and joy are threatened by the Boogeyman, and from there the plot comes pretty close to mirroring this summer's The Avengers movie. Mostly in a good way."
2," Don't let its restraint fool you: As unshowy as it is, ""The Phenom"" has an impressive collection of tools."
2," Smart, honest, sickeningly funny and supremely well judged in the writing, direction and acting."
2," While Daniels' work disappoints, his film is saved from disaster by uniformly terrific performances."
0, Rush shapes Carver's fable -- a quick and resonant read -- into a flimsy hour-and-a-half tale of rebirth rather than a piercing character study.
2, Stylish and beautifully shot.
0," A sex comedy with plenty of sex, not enough comedy, and nowhere near enough smarts to pull off its final act attempts at Midnight Cowboy-style pathos."
2, With Private Ryan the object is to put you in a place no sane person would choose to go. And it does.
2," Costner may be the star, but the high school athletes also shine. After all, this ""based-on-a-true-story"" movie is their story, too."
2," Over two decades later, it's still funny."
2," The tone of ""Dope"" is very interesting - funny, but rarely stupid-funny. The film does not wear its serious observations, about aspirations and realities and hypocrisies of all kinds (not just racial), in a heavy fashion."
2," A clever, low-budget exercise from the young Australian-based director Joseph Sims-Dennett, Observance is a hybrid of two familiar brands of psychological thriller."
0," There's an undeniable ""ick"" factor to this film that overwhelms the justifiable cougar angle. Even worse is the boredom that soon sets in."
0," On ice, the movie is often fairly funny. Off it, the garish outfits, the genitalia jokes, the beer-slob gags about gays, the women as cheap laughs, even the cute guest cameos start to shiver and melt."
0," It's a flat, clumsy piece of filmmaking."
0," Kidnap's clumsy clunkiness, exposition-heavy monologues and inferior story keep it in that late-night cable category that seems perfectly entertaining so long as you aren't paying for it."
2," For the original generation of ""Star Wars"" fans who weren't sure what to make of episodes one, two, and three, ""Rogue One"" is the prequel they've always wanted."
2," It's fine, and on occasion it even flirts with looney tune greatness, but mostly it's held back by predictability."
0," That the movie works to any degree is a genuine shock, but that's not enough to overcome its inevitable slide into routine."
2," Won't please literalists...and it's frequently a bit absurd. But visually 'Noah' evinces a sort of loony grandeur, and emotionally it possesses much stronger resonance than one might expect, not least because of Russell Crowe's zealous performance."
2, A quirky comedy about an egocentric young man who proves himself to be an eager student of life.
0, The unenviable task of adapting a famously mediocre newspaper comic is one the filmmakers meet with noticeable strain.
0," Occasionally, I see a chunk of cinematic debris that strikes so many wrong chords that I can't figure out how the project was greenlighted in the first place. This is one of those incidents."
0," Even the dogs don't look like they're having fun in ""Dog Days."""
2," The Thing brings no shame to the franchise, but it doesn't build on it much, either."
2," It's the scenes detailing Tom's efforts to bring all the material together that demonstrate what he's really capable of, and they give the film a satisfying pay-off."
0," An awful, stillborn comedy assembled out of rusty spare parts from secret agent movies and run-of-the-mill Saturday Night Live skits."
0," If Allen had remained in Paris, we might call his new film a divertissement -- a diversion, an amusement, albeit one that is crowded with characters and ideas."
0," This cheerless, tiresome sequel is so tastless and flimsy that it proves big families aren't much fun after all."
0, This high-concept vampire film suffers from a disappointingly low-concept approach.
2," The film moves freely between flashbacks, memories, and present day scenes, allowing each to bleed into the others. It's energetic filmmaking, even if it's often messy."
2," A beautifully produced, intelligently written and pleasingly well-acted bit of faux Capra-corn."
2," The tone of the picture is often off-kilter throughout, but the subject matter and the performance of Helen Mirren as Alma go a long way toward forgiving the movie's strange anomalies."
0," The film is a triumph of visual imagination over any story or substance, over-directed and over-acted and completely absent a beating heart."
0," A Christmas Tale isn't repugnant, just regressive. The modern family film has moved beyond this Gallic update of I Remember Mama."
0," Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book, the so-called narrative is more like a jamboree inside Rowling's head."
2, It's impossible to look at the world we live in and not see the stark future the movie warned us about
2," It's not exactly action-filled, but its main character is explicit about what's on her mind and how deep-seated her desire to escape is. "
2," Happy Hour transcends its facade of entertainment, positioning itself as a product that works more like a lecture of its era. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0, Cody's sophomore effort shows no real feel for teen comedy or teen horror; somebody undid her doodle.
0, ...suffers from a pervasively stagnant atmosphere that effectively drains the energy right out of its high-octane moments...
2, You've got to make room in your heart for a film in which the world ends with neither a bang nor a whimper but a cuddle.
0, Tão ruim que deveria figurar numa cláusula adicional da Convenção de Genebra para que tivéssemos a certeza de que não seria exibido como forma de tortura a prisioneiros políticos.
2," As long as the kids stay in the picture -- thankfully, that's most of the movie -- Spider-Man: Homecoming is the fun playdate most of us have been looking forward to since the character stole Cap's shield last spring in Captain America: Civil War."
0," David Gelb doesn't evince so much as a single compositional sleight of hand, merely delighting in turning lights on and off and watching Zoe appear in random places."
2, Krasinski served up a horror-thriller unlike any other with A Quiet Place.
0," As a pressing piece of propaganda, the film could use a louder voice and edgier tone."
0," Without style or substance, it's one of the most boring docs of the year. "
2," Not since Insomnia have we had a police thriller so subtle and mind-soaking, or anxieties so poisoned in a heart of darkness."
0, A strong first 2/3 devolves into a final third which is almost entirely retroactive exposition. 
2," Despite Fumie, Tomiko, Shigeko and Shoto's wife Noriko (Yu Aoi) never quite getting woke, a pesky sitcom vibe and a bloated run time, Wonderful Family! 3 has a sweetness that's hard to resist."
0, As the drama unfolds the ludicrousness of J Mills Goodloe and Will Fetters's script intensifies and the dramatic punches are more liable to provoke howls of laughter than tears of sadness.
0," The jokes just aren't funny, and Macdonald's sardonic, 'non-acting' style of acting quickly becomes tiresome."
0, ... what we have instead is a documentary meant to inspire and elevate.
2, The super-charged 'Captain America: Civil War' is a winner. 
2, There is a dark undertone that is fascinating...the cast that surrounds Foy is great in this movie...I like when movies affect me emotionally.
0, A one sided look at the argument against drilling for natural gas; Damon needs to entertain and stay off his soapbox.
0," Project X. Sounds like a horror story. In a way, it is. This is a teen partying movie on steroids."
2," A thoughtful reflection on the sociopolitical narratives (and myths) of contemporary, crisis-ridden France."
0," Part character study and part airport-novel nonsense, ""The Accountant"" can't quite balance its B-movie instincts with its more artistic aspirations, ultimately hamstringing a potentially juicy, escapist shoot-'em-up."
2," fantastic job setting up a very eerie, frightening and confusing story ... but the ending falls short of our greatest hopes"
2, Phenomena (a.k.a. Creepers) provides what is alternately Argento's most batty and spiritual landscape.
0, What's sadder than the sorry story is that Hrithik Roshan is condemned to be better than the movies he acts in.
2," One of Billy Wilder's lesser films, Irma La Douce relies entirely on its two stars, Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, neither of whom is particularly good or funny, despite the masks and the accents."
2," After a muddled beginning, the deliberately paced film ties together its characters and disparate genre elements in mostly unexpected ways."
0," Fired Up is cinema as abuse, and its chief victim is any paying audience. To have shelled out cash for this witless farrago of sub-Porky's japery and straight-to-bargain-bin acting would be the airborne spin that broke the cheerleader's back."
0," ""Madre"" is more of an exercise than a movie, turning every parent's worst nightmare into a gimmicky calling card."
2," There's no way that Hall Pass is anywhere near the classic comedies the brothers made earlier in their careers, but it is far from their worst comedy."
2," With the help of two stand-out performances -- from both Darín and Renier -- White Elephant manages to engage and educate its audience in a heartfelt, if noisy, manner."
2," ""The Hollow Point"" might not reach the hallucinatory heights of a Joel and Ethan Coen thriller, but there's much to admire."
0, The tagline says 'go home.' I say 'stay home.'
0," Laced with telegraphed character development, ghost-in-the-machine plot points, and preachy commentary, ""State of Play"" is a pedantic thriller caught in its own obvious clockwork."
0, ...it has so many gadgets and gizmos in it that it sinks under its own weight.
0," The plot of this movie is simple at its core, but it spirals out to become increasingly bizarre. "
2, Uma pequena pérola que faz jus ao filme no qual foi inspirada.
0," A dry dream of postmenopausal-male sexual lethargy, this comedy's least musty ideas are among its worst."
0," Ultimately, The Mummy isn't absolutely terrible... there's a lot of potential here that's been squandered by including Cruise and Crowe."
0, You end up loathing the Reverend so much that he leaves himself no room to bring you round to his side in time for the obligatory feelgood finish.
2," An inquisitive and engaging documentary that attempts to sift through shifting mores and the sexual saturation of mass media, to determine the toll this seeming increase in titillation is taking on America."
2," The plot is only serviceable, but it perfectly serves its main function ... an excuse to string together a series of ultracool fight and chase sequences."
2," With so many personalities and characters, there's little time for any standout performances... or a standout film. That said: it isn't bad, either."
0," Disjointed, uneven, unfocused, and hazy!"
2," The once-ubiquitous 'Full Monty' formula is alive, well and still irresistible"
2," The Station Agent is a fine and funny film that explores all the curious ways in which friendship can abound, express love, and turn us around."
0," If you're new to this crazy Mel Brooks creation, this 2005 cinematic torture chamber is the last way anyone should experience it for the first time."
2, Lurid advance ads for Devil's Advocate make it look ridiculous. It's not.
0," Depois de um tempo, parei de prestar atenção na história (hein?) e me concentrei na boa trilha sonora. Além disso, o filme é curto o bastante para não se tornar intolerável."
0, Made me miss Emily Blunt.
2," ..family entertainment in the best sense, in that it's not something adults would watch on their own, but it's not something they have to endure in pain, either."
2, John Huston's debut is still primo noir.
0," This isn't a good enough movie; its plot is tangled, and it's both overstuffed and thinly-sketched. "
2, The Founder is a solid biopic but not one that will go down in history - unlike the multi-million dollar-making fast food chain at its core.
0," The trouble is, the film's decadence isn't a put-on, it is, simply, depressingly, degeneratively, decadent."
0," Pearl Harbor is superficial, melodramatic and too long -- and that's the good news."
2," What a pleasure... that Driver not only delivers-giving a quiet, soulful, kindhearted performance that's my favorite thing he's done thus far-but that Jarmusch's film is as wise, winning, and surprisingly moving as it is"
0," After a fast, funny start, the new sequel, ""Johnny English Reborn,'' proves to be more of the same."
0, Crosses the blue line so often you're compelled to pin it against the boards and administer a quick knee to the groin.
2," It's a surprisingly honest study of co-dependence, insecurity, and control."
2, What the film does best is to demonstrate the strength of the bond between the band and its audience.
0," This attention to the wealth of the 2% is just conspicuous consumption of another sort, and it ain't pretty or funny."
0, The original film was far superior and will be remembered in years to come while the current remake will soon be forgotten.
2, Too many documentaries suffer for just assuming we'll agree their subjects are interesting. This one puts in the work and gives us reason to be compelled.
0," Big, garish, loud and dumb as a box of Rockettes."
0," The film is not without spectacle, but it is strangely without soul."
0," An inconsequential, barely there bit of piffle."
0, 2408 amounts to little more than a radical shock-therapy session for a man still finding his way after the loss of his daughter. Best to leave him alone with his issues.
2, A flawed-yet-interesting effort from a man seemingly capable of doing it all (...) and a commendable first attempt at crafting something ambitious and realistic.
2, Haneke has created a gift for both audiences and the two legendary actors cast in the lead roles. 
2," The picture resembles the recent 200 Streets, though it could have used some of that film's unabashed soapiness."
0," Even though it's creative and cleverly edited, Hitchcock/Truffaut it's not an original piece of work and doesn't add anything in cinematic terms. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," We realize that Leslie may be a fun-loving guy, but his idea of fun leads to dismemberment. A question becomes thrust upon the reporters as well as the audience. Could you just stand there and watch?"
2," Friday Night Lights is a movie that gets the gridiron action exactly right, but does not dig deeply enough into the lives of the players off the field."
2," Noisy, insanely fun and shameless - embrace your inner rocker and party on!"
2," To my surprise, director Kim Kwang-sik did a clever job of masking his actors' weak points and making the most of their strengths in this action-packed flick."
0, As entertaining as watching the last bits of ketchup drip out of the bottle.
0," Big, noisy, slick, and empty."
0, Trying to figure what is the most offensive thing about this accidental mashup of 70s Woody Allen and Sex and the City...
0," Fans might lap it up out of habit, but it's bizarre to watch the ""Hatchet"" universe get smaller and sillier as it expands, with Green refusing to put a DNR order on his creation. "
2," It is entertainingly over the top, although perhaps the CGI work isn't quite out of the top drawer. "
0," Weitz's movie remains ultimately remote. It ends mid-adventure, so blatantly setting the stage for a sequel that the whole thing suddenly feels like a preamble."
0," We're stuck for eternity with two perfectly decent people who, it seems, just aren't very interesting company. Not even for each other."
2," When I first saw The Orphanage, I found it an overly clinical genre exercise whose sentimental moments felt forced, but it will also plant roots in your subconscious and linger there for weeks."
2," The suspense plot is effective yet familiar; the direction is brisk, even hasty, and impersonal."
0, The movie settles for showers of gore with intermittent moments of spoofiness.
0," This feels like a middling 80s action film supposedly amped up by being set in Paris, but instead dumbed down by daft story telling."
2, A film that succeeds both as biography and poetic travelogue.
2, A tremendous portrait of grief and prejudice. 
2," This is the kind of artistic gamble that either sets a picture up to soar, or to come crashing down. Happily, it is the former"
2," As a keenly observed portrayal of the African-American experience, it seems every bit as important a film as Moonlight is, even if the Academy will probably never recognise its brilliance."
2," The film is full of goofy, joyful moments, anchored by the sweet chemistry between Carrey and Deschanel as well as a life-affirming message that everyone could use these days."
0," No Strings Attached is nominally a raunchy romantic comedy, but Natalie Portman betrays so little indication of enjoying herself you'd be forgiven for thinking we were watching deleted scenes from Black Swan."
2," ""The Danish Girl"" - A long road to martyrdom."
2," It remains a spiritual, violent and significant telling of preacher Nat Turner's Virginia-based slave rebellion. "
0, The stunts in Need for Speed are real: No computer pixels were harmed in the making of this film. It's the people who are fake.
0," The Spierigs' dusky noir has plenty of style, but the movie never develops beyond its intriguing setting, and the wildly uneven performances do nothing to draw you in."
0," It contains nothing that is offensive, challenging, or complex, nor does it contain any great deal of wit, color, or imagination."
0," Teen lit will be back, but ""The Death Cure"" is lost in a maze of its own design."
2," I don't think it's a stretch to say that once the picture gets into Hollywood's bloodstream, it could well prove to be as influential as John Woo's 2989 crime thriller, The Killer."
2, This old-fashioned star vehicle of the highest order lacks conventional drama and conflict -- and is none the worse for those absences.
2," In the high-contrast, black-and-white, wide-screen images, Garrel captures creative and erotic passions with a spontaneous classicism and a monumental poise."
0," Though it's difficult to discern the flavour of ice cream used in one so-called erotic encounter, it's probably vanilla."
0," While the premise had potential, the execution leaves a lot to be desired and strands three charismatic performers up on the screen trying to make something of it. They don't. (Parental Movie Review also available)"
0," The story surely is interesting, but in this form, not terribly enlightening."
0," Unfortunately, How to be Single is annoyingly jittery and woefully generic. The characterizations all feel synthetic and the contrived dilemmas for how these young women cope with men of uncertainty, reluctance and absurdity fall flat"
2," Fun, creepy, unpretentious little haunted house rides like these are so hard to come by these days that slight overpraise is understandable."
0, An often toothless and ridiculous rape revenge thriller...
2, Pleasing twists and moral dilemmas abound. 
2, A superb job at tugging heartstrings.
0," Lacking energy and pace and enslaved by a ghastly score, this tepid movie left me longing alternately for David Lean's thrillingly grim 2948 masterpiece, and Carol Reed's chipper 2968 sing-along, with pretty tunes by Lionel Bart."
0," Considering how utterly slow and anticlimactic the film becomes in its final hour, it's impossible for me to justify saying the film is worth paying today's ticket prices."
2, A supreme example of movie junk food.
2, Heavy-handed melodrama with flashes of brilliance.
2," Will he break the Internet or will it break him? It's painfully recognizable, this neediness, as is the rise and fall. Ralph, c'est moi."
0, Afternoon Delight has many small pleasures but falls far short of reaching the G spot.
2," What makes Corpse Bride sing, ultimately, is the breadth of imagination that it demonstrates; creating a cluttered, textured and mysteriously beautiful world that we're loathe to leave at the end."
2," The latest in a long and pandering lot of heartwarming movies about troubled foreign kids, Valentin benefits from a general sense of realism and behavioral credibility."
0, Yeah...um...no...don't ever do this again please. 
0," There's an ultrasappy, unnecessary and modern spin on the classic happily ever after. You know, because so many people have complained for centuries that the end needed a do-over. "
2," Either a return to form, a winking homage to the whole series, or a dumbing down of the angsty, introspective Bond of the Daniel Craig era. Choose up sides."
0, Elliott's attempts at killer entertainment only result in the actors making utter fools of themselves and complete exhaustion on the part of the audience.
0," Winterbottom's confident technique holds us for only half the running time of The Wedding Guest, a flimsy thriller about a tight-lipped lone wolf possibly named Jay."
2," All things considered, and in spite of nearly every potential cinematic pitfall you can think of, the film delivers a satisfying, endearing romance and is one of the better of La Lopez's oeuvre."
0, Norton's acting and Dahl's gift for sustaining a tone save Rounders from completely floundering.
0," blandly inoffensive.... It's like they took the original and sanded off all the sharp corners and rough edges to make something slicker, but also undeniably rote."
0, Good acting only goes so far to salvage a bad script.
2," This is the rare screwball comedy that is superbly paced, cleverly plotted and hilarious from start to finish."
0," An assemblage of almost-characters in an almost-story, resulting in a very disappointing almost-movie."
0," Not a total fiasco. When Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman finally leaps into the fray, deep into the picture's second half, she more than passes the audition."
2," [Garner]'s the bridge the story needs to avoid being pigeonholed as another smug Evangelical advertisement, and her performance elevates Miracles to a Christian film worthy of the name."
2," The film's ideals of a respectful, caring suitor and a diverse utopian community with a chill vibe don't necessarily register as an escapist fantasy."
0," If there were a pill that made people smarter, I'd donate an extra supply to the creators of ""Limitless."""
2," In a land of recycled ideas and remakes, The Fourth Kind is a valiant original, no matter how deceptive it may ultimately be."
2," Without CGI, superheroes or recycled dinosaurs, thus far, Dope is the best film of the year."
2, Tropic Thunder pushes more buttons than most comedies dare.
2, This is a baseball story that's less about game-winning hits and more about people willing to challenge the establishment.
0," If none of this sounds very remarkable, that's because it isn't."
2, Crackingly entertaining documentary.
2," Bleak yet beautiful, Lean on Pete takes surprising, unexpected turns in direction and narrative, albeit its cathartic final moments are quite conventional...the tears are earned."
2," Well, it certainly is enthusiastic."
2," While not a true Escobar biopic, it's still a solid thriller with a strong turn by Benicio Del Toro. "
2," Full of detail, the film is almost claustrophobic at times as we stay inside the cabin of the yacht while the ocean heaves outside, the wind howls, the boat shrieks... it's a unique work"
2, A tribute to anyone standing up for themselves on the front lines of any dangerous conflict situation.
2," The Two Towers is a satisfying and wholly gripping drama in its own right. Inevitably, Janus-like, it looks back to the Shire, and forward to the hour of doom. And after three hours, you will too."
2, This fourth instalment will please the older fans of the series and should make some new ones amongst the audience who were too young to catch Scream on its first go round.
0, The paper-thin story...would barely have passed as a half-hour episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents...
0," Veterans Englund and Shaye admirably give it their all, but their best efforts are not enough to elevate the subpar material directed in mechanical fashion by Zariwny."
0," Ms. Thierry plays Marguerite with an understatement that can be enigmatic, seductive, or deliberately confounding. The picture as a whole doesn't do justice to her committed performance."
0," Shows that America, for all its loudhailed Christianity, doesn't really need God at all. It just needs Sandra Bullock and her like."
0, The combination of Redford and Nick Nolte only manages to make this walk in the woods as exciting as a summer stroll.
2," A film where special effects erase physics and the constraints of the human body, there's absolutely no telling what will come next."
2, Kapadia provides a heartbreaking reminder of what we lost when we lost her.
0," There's a general overbearing unpleasantness to Observe and Report, and you get the feeling this was the intention -- in order to make it more ""like life."""
2," Barry's preening self-regard and its counterpart, abject self-loathing, come across as rooted in vulnerability, inadequacy, alienation. You feel bad for this lonely guy, even as you laugh at him."
0, Faithful and fundamentally dull.
2," There are some people it will offend. To them I say, go bask in some Happy Days reruns. To the rest of you: Go see it and delight in laughing until your sides split."
2," The Last Five Years is Anna Kendrick's tour de force, and she sings her heart out, nearly breaking ours in the process."
0," The performances of Jason Bateman, T. J. Miller, Olivia Munn, Jennifer Aniston and Kate McKinnon, among others, fail to save this movie from its own shortcomings. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," It's a big, bloody, beautifully-filmed epic with so much more personality than I've come to expect from a movie of this genre. "
0," Fatally compromised (but) ambitious and clever... It reminds us of the way majority America treats black men in particular, with a humiliating mistrust that's never far behind the admiration expressed for those who 'earn' approval through their talents..."
2, The repetitiveness of concentrating on watching [the frames]...is like quiet meditation on the power of the image. The cumulative effect is a mesmerising insight into Kiarostami's creative process. 
0," We've seen this story too many times before, so you don't have to be an expert tracker to see this flick's every move a mile away."
2, A superior version of an already very good film.
2," Oh-oh. Maybe I've been grousing about 'January junk' a little too long. Because here's 'Cloverfieldk,' it's January, and this movie is by no means junk."
2," Okay, so it's not exactly a groundbreaking advance from the team behind Ice Age, but with its kaleidoscope of colour and heaps of humour, you'll be charmed."
0, Children rule the day in this semi-autobiographical film by new film maker So Yong Kim but it comes off more as an exercise in filmmaking than entertainment.
0," Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is the true Tower of Babel, the movie star who with each film gets closer to God and whose films always come tumbling down around him."
0," So what was De Palma thinking...did the moviemaking mastermind behind such intriguing fare like Blow Out, Scareface, and the super-charged Mission: Impossible drink too much cough syrup to the point where it left him uncharacteristically disoriented?"
2," ... the end result is immensely satisfying, and should be so both for fans like myself and newcomers."
0, The bad guys are such extreme political caricatures and the climax is so cack-handed that the structure can't hold.
2, It demonstrates that a film can be exciting and funny and epic in scope while still retaining the peculiar vision of an artiste compelled to capture his obsessions with a Techniscope lens.
2," Self-taught and roaming free in the city, Vivian Maier captured the remarkable in the ordinary."
2, This movie's greatest strengths and weaknesses are in its action scenes.
0," From start to finish, the film is death-ridden and employs overamplified sound to pump up its many pornographic images."
2," From a philosophical viewpoint it's fitting that the inaugural movie to unite martial arts legends Jackie Chan and Jet Li is a fantasy film for young teenagers. Forbidden Kingdom"" may not be ""Enter the Dragon,"" but it's not supposed to be."
0," The film is noteworthy as early Spielberg, but it hasn't stood the test of time. New movies, like Joy Ride, tackle the same material more deftly."
0," Lavie has a lot of provocative ideas in the oven here, most of them tend to be half-baked."
0," The film looks great, but too much of it feels reheated, overly familiar, and overly cautious. This is the film where Affleck needed to really cut loose, but instead he played it safe."
0, One of the stupidest films ever made.
0, Unsuccessfully marries the slick-suited jargoning of Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's trilogy with the gloves-off double-dealing of Guy Ritchie's early oeuvre.
2," It may not be as relevant as its predecessor, but if there were no nostalgia, no one would be watching it, that's the factor that makes it effective. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, This story of a corporate vice president and the surrogate mother she hires is so committed to convention that it runs into cliché.
2," While some might consider chess a bit of a stretch when it comes to being a sport, the film's infectious charm can't be denied."
0, This low-budget indie is somber and dreary on a moment-to-moment basis and leaves its talented cast stranded with few opportunities to alleviate the sense of stasis.
0," An overhyped, underthought vortex of boredom that knocks the credibility of fantasy geekdom down another few dungeon levels."
2," Films like A Ghost Story-so odd and outside the typical cinematic experience-don't happen often these days, but when they do they can remind us of the power of the cinematic image. "
2," Though many would argue that Morris' approach to reckoning with the right by giving Bannon an outlet to spread his rhetoric is a misguided mistake, I see it as an opportunity to try to understand one's enemy as a means of self-defense."
2, The cast of characters is small and well-drawn by an ensemble of veteran actors.
0," ...if you, like me, think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with, then you're in for a painful ride."
2, Vol. 2 fills in the motivational and emotional blanks that left the first movie tasting like a meal made only of appetizers.
0, The Fifth Estate proves little more than a showcase for the acting talents of a supreme mime in the form of the lanky Cumberbatch.
0," If we were to treat the making of The Girl on the Train, the seriously disappointing adaptation of Paula Hawkins's blockbuster novel, as a whodunnit, there'd be plenty of places where one might lay the blame."
2," It runs a little long, but the Fast faithful won't care. I, on the other hand, had more fun a couple of laps back with this series, but I'm sure it won't run out of gas here."
0, The result is a film with an interesting premise that never plays out. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," ... too much action, not enough comedy, and no romance at all ... "
2," A fresh, muscular payback movie shot through with Soderbergh's mischievous indie-spirit."
0," Cheesy special effects, under drawn characters, simplistic writing (by a committee of scribes) and music video direction will likely draw the attention-deficit crowd"
0," This European Noah's Ark adventure pales in comparison even with more lacklustre Hollywood animation, mainly due to a script that simply doesn't hold water..."
0," It's a great style, it's a fabulous performance, but it never quite finds what it's searching for."
2," There are literally dozens of documentaries about the Warsaw Ghetto, but A Film Unfinished is unique in a very horrible way."
2," Long after you've seen the film, you'll remember the wonderfully nuanced work of the cast, particularly Ms. Hawkins."
0," Chandor's debut feature audaciously asks us to empathize with obscenely overpaid risk analysts and their bosses, a gambit that fails... largely because his characters are little more than mouthpieces for blunt speechifying and Mamet-like outbursts"
0," When the crucial moment of the story comes, it feels emotionally stunted and unrelated to anything that has passed."
2," Griffin is quick, smart and funny, and presents the critics with the usual challenge in reviewing a comedy concert: What do you write about, apart from quoting his funniest lines?"
2, Nebraska is The Last Picture Show (2972) without the picture show.
0, The truly depressing thing about a thriller as undercoocked as Unforgettable is its failure to fly on dark fantasy.
2," Snappy and visually spry, with a treasure trove of vintage instructional and industrial film clips, this is an urgent, overlong (more than two hours) work that delivers a timely message about the times in which we live."
2," A singularly original work, part portrait of Baldwin, part history of the racial struggle, part essay, part manifesto."
2, Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon's vision tries to elevate the everyday to a realm of magic by way of the absurd.
0, Emmerich's mirthless hatchet job is hoisted with its own petard.
2," Superbly constructed, dazzlingly animated, and genuinely hilarious, with a spirited mood of adventure and a pleasing read of maturation. "
2, An absolute stunner.
2," Tokyo Sonata is a bit overwrought, especially in the final act, but it is beautifully shot, features moving performances by the well-chosen cast and has the unity of vision that is the hallmark of an auteur."
0," I doubt bets will be taken on there being a ""3""."
2, It's a wonderful film that balances life and death and it will tug at your heartstrings and stay with you for a very long time.
0," What's onscreen feels squeezed, truncated and curiously embalmed. It's got no kick to it... Oldboy just lies there like old news that's not worth a second thought."
2," Driven by a genuinely consuming curiosity, taking delight in excavating hitherto unavailable information about a creative enigma whom, perhaps, would rather remain that way."
0," Dennis Quaid turns in a strong performance, but writer-director Ramin Bahrani's earnest but unfocused melodrama offers neither a compelling storyline nor a satisfying message."
0, About the best that can be said for Windtalkers is that it's a John Woo movie. It's too bad it's not a good John Woo movie
2, A brutal Russian masterpiece.
2," ""Mountain"" is a lush treat for the senses, scaling great heights, literally, both visually and with its sound."
2," This is clearly a first work with several issues, especially in its midsection, that's nonetheless promising and already makes one wonder what Kim will do next."
2," The empty space surrounding the vulnerable man emphasizes the exertion involved rather than the goal of escape: like the hologram who came to life because he wanted to, THX finally achieves his humanity by an assertion of will."
0, Too bad The Crash lives up to its inauspicious name.
0," As good as the cast is, particularly Chalamet in his fearless depiction of Nick's rollercoaster existence, ""Beautiful Boy"" remains a chore to watch."
0," Zoe's detriment, as mentioned, is not necessarily any of its individual parts, such as its cast, cinematography, score, or direction. It's that, despite all of this, they don't quite add up to anything more impactful or memorable."
2, Starman is more of a love story than a sci-fi movie. Take your girlfriend.
0," While entertaining, the film doesn't achieve the ultimate goal of Steve Jobs' work: to make the things that matter beautiful and to find beauty in the small moments."
2," Unapologetic, wonderful, fun, sacastic and lucid. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, A slightly unpleasant and shocking film.
0," While Rondo plays with some interesting ideas, it fails to present anything of substance, resulting in a sloppy mess of an attempt to create a modern exploitation film. "
0, Writer-director Daniel Peddle's anthropological concerns never really wed themselves to a sturdy narrative bedrock. 
0," As executed by writer-director Ari Folman, the concept is tidy, superficially clever, and almost defiantly irrelevant."
0," It is contrived and predictable, squandering the chemistry between co-stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds as it creates lazy escapist entertainment that is forgotten as soon as the end credits have rolled."
0, A film that loses all interest and is even quite unbearable when Brando is not on screen. [Full review in Spanish]
2," worth seeing, primarily for its beautiful Goa setting"
2," Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa move things along fast enough to keep [the problem aspects] from sinking in too deeply, and star Tina Fey holds the spotlight with aplomb."
0," It was less terrible than I feared, but still fell well short of being good."
0, Every generation gets the battle-of-the-sexes female-buddy revenge comedy it deserves [...] The current generation must have done something terrible to merit a revenge comedy this dire.
2, The quality of the craft at the best moments of the film is undeniable.
0," I can forgive the Oscar- winning makeover, but not the script-doctored romance"
0, The idea is good but some decisions like casting and taking elements of the vengeance thriller genre bring the whole concept down. [Full review in Spanish]
0," In spite of the promise it shows, Bullet Head comes up less than the sum of its parts."
0, The film is such a misjudged farrago that it makes Miss Congeniality seem like a masterpiece.
0," Honestly, the whole experience would fare better as a skit rather than a feature-length film"
2, The sequence in which Manning confides in former hacker Adrian Lamo and gets turned in to the FBI supplies the kind of human drama that has made Gibney's work so engrossing in the past.
2, Bright Sunshine In is both profoundly silly and acutely observed.
2," The setpieces are often funny and the finale visually spectacular, but Depp is hanging on to this series as a source of treasure more than inspiration."
2," If anything, Beasts of No Nation's horrors are overwhelming, and you may begin to feel like you've been in the jungle longer than Col. Kurtz."
2, Reed and Shepherd do a reasonable job of injecting some level of balance into their straightforward retelling.
2," At times resembles a multi-million dollar perfume ad set in a fantastical, medieval-inflected world. Yet the central performances shine through and there is just enough humour."
0," Religulous is the type of film to be sent off into the world to crack open a few eyes and change some lives. In reality, only those patient with Maher and already free of devotion will be receptive to the message. It's a missed opportunity."
2," Heart-wrenching WWI drama has heavy content, strong heroine."
0," It's not interesting enough to watch, and not dull enough to walk out of. It prompts a mild state of catatonia, and nothing more."
2," Broadcast News is a slick and well- scripted comedy, witty and well-paced; it makes no points that haven't been made before, but like its TV news team it makes them entertainingly."
2," ""Super 8'' is a curious thing indeed: A good movie that makes you want to go home and re-watch a great one."
2, You're actually able to follow and get invested in this family just by following their digital activity -- feels both improbable and inevitable.
0," The performances are naturalistic, but the story is melodramatic -- it's simply too bad to be true."
0, The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute.
2," Crowe seems to be making baby steps into new territory, both stylistically and emotionally."
0," BlacKkKlansman is a poor detective tale and simple-minded Millennial noir because Stallworth's exposé of a sect of American racists and terrorist (all unhealthy-looking white miscreants) never feels like discovery, just a continuation of his hip cynicism."
2," Knock a star off if you're feeling cynical, but otherwise surrender to this fun, funny, spirited debut."
0," Full of coarse excuses for humor and cruelty, 'Grown Ups 2' literally spews bile at its audience."
0," The movie's animal rights, vegetarian message should go down easily with politically correct parents - at least until they choke on the offensive depiction of 27th-century turkeys as face-painted, headband-wearing native Americans."
0," The whole thing feels too mindlessly cheerful, far too airy to be remembered."
0," Well-acted, but under-written and forgettable. "
0, sticks to convention

0," if you can't quite get behind a defiant diva and her queer companion, you'll find every moment of this motion picture a chore"
2, ...one of the most moving and flat-out indelible love stories to come around in quite some time.
0," [It] purports to be based on actual events, chronicling the sinister machinations of a shadowy military organization. But this clumsy action movie feels too generic to be real."
2," There's a whole lot of shaking going on - and I'm not referring only to penis and dildo gags - but the insanity of ideas in what is an outrageous, crude party that broadly explores the divide between youth-inspired excess and adulthood"
2," ... a film that is at once a delicate, moving drama and a vibrant city symphony, offering a predawn view of New York seldom captured on film."
2," An odd, intriguing, and entertaining film."
0, ...the various elements that made Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure such an unexpected delight are almost entirely absent here.
2," Is it immoral to celebrate villainy? There's not much point in pretending The Wolf of Wall Street doesn't do that, pretty exuberantly too."
0, A low-cal account of artistic endeavor and sacrifice.
0," The blandest, most emotionally inexpressive performance yet from the least distinguished member of The Lord of the Rings' ensemble cast."
0, Envelope-pushing revenge drama is ultraviolent (and slow).
0," Viewed independently of its problematic pedigree, however, this gently meandering affair only just gets by."
2," Hill envisions these endless days with a kid's-eye abstraction that's both timeless and firmly entrenched in its own era: his skate punks banter like Kevin Smith extras, wander like Richard Linklater dreamers, and misbehave like Larry Clark lost boys."
0," Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House is a frantic, over-detailed yawn."
2, Screen royalty elevates Just Wright from the rom-com heap.
0," In its weaker moments, Anon feels less like a traditional detective story than an exercise in computer search engine sleuthing. Too many digital bells and whistles get in the way of an otherwise conventional detective story."
2, Those old salts at Aardman Studios have come up with a rollicking comedy adventure that more than lives up to the company's tradition of teeming visual invention and quirky fun.
2, Take only that part of you that is still 22 years old and check your brain at the door.
2," It may be lean narratively, but Cold War packed an emotional punch. A beautiful film that speaks about the complexity of human emotion."
0," There's a juicy story in here, but Orgnani desiccates his narrative by relying on jargon-laden interviews with political wonks and dry intellectuals, presenting a byzantine account of the events with little context."
0, There are an awful lot of subplots and comic characters but none of the actors in this star-studded cast is allowed to build his laughs and the Coens just abandon several of these vivid personalities along the way.
2," Slick and entertaining, Joy is just a little too slight for this much Oscar-worthy talent."
0, Watching Hawke investigate strange goings-on night after night without turning on one light in the house becomes unintentionally comical.
0," Her performance, in a word, is magnificent, and whenever she's on-screen this intricately layered psychological melodrama is as fascinating and as mesmerizing as anything else 2008 has produced."
0, The question regarding Vantage Point is how this thriller with the Groundhog Day fixation was allowed to meander out of Columbia Pictures so overloaded with bad acting.
0," For a while, Life Aquatic gets mileage out of its quirkiness and the promise that a real plot will kick in. But it's not to be, and for most of the film's second half it feels like Anderson and his characters are treading water."
0," [An] oddly misanthropic, occasionally amusing but thoroughly cheerless holiday attraction."
0," Batman v Superman is a hot, steaming heap of trash."
0," Meant to cash in on the craze for fantasy films about hormonal teens started by a certain chick-lit vampire series, Beastly merely shows how Twilight got it right."
0, A comedy that doesn't go for cheap laughs is commendable. A comedy that doesn't go for any laughs at all is inexplicable.
2," As a poetic tale of an outrageous artist-as-a-young-boy, It's Not Me, I Swear is also reminiscent of Léolo, the wonderful 2992 film by the late Jean-Claude Lauzon."
2," The lively setting helps, but the main attration here is the familiar story, which has been around forever and yet never gets old."
2," A little overwrought in the final scenes, The King Of Pigs is still visually impressive and thought-provoking animation for adults nonetheless."
2, The film is built on the chemistry of Revolori and Mantzoukas.
2," he bucolic rhythms of life in the orange grove have a lot of allure. It's Eden on the Murray and if you sit back and let its glories wash over you, you'll find a lot here to like."
0," There's definitely plenty to laugh about in Cedar Rapids, there just isn't too much to applaud about."
0," It's mostly all doom and gloom. Fans of Baumbach have come to expect that from him lately, but is it so much to ask for a good story and some likeable characters as well?"
2, A film made for fans of the main actor and for those who love history lessons. [Full review in Spanish]
0, Neither star is very physically believable in her/his role and neither manages to imbue his/her character with much in the way of credible emotion.
2," Beautiful in the extreme, a revelation in high-def."
2," At times, it makes you realize Solondz may be the closest heir we'll get to Robert Bresson, the French filmmaker of human despair and mysterious grace."
0," It feels much longer than its 90 minutes, and I left it feeling like I didn't really learn much about its title character or her father."
2," Classic horror in the vein of Hitchcock, Argento and Miike...the scariest film in years!"
2," With the will-they-or-won't-they tension, the densely plotted conflicts that rarely give you time to think, and the fact that everyone on all sides has a reason to stop Hunt, this is a satisfying Hollywood actioner that keeps you guessing."
0," Unfortunately, in Getaway, the bad things that happen include a lazy script."
0," The Last Stand, which contradicts its subtitle with the cheesiest sequel tag of the year, slumps as soon as it introduces its plot gimmick."
0, [Inherent Vice] takes its own sweet time to get places. And sometimes you might wonder if we actually needed to go to all of those places in the first place.
2," ""Monkey Kingdom"" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome. It doesn't monkey around - that's left to the film's subjects, who are more than happy to oblige."
0," Gracie is no failure, but its mishmash of sports tropes and melodrama doesn't satisfy the way it could have."
2, Twilight is a must see and a must for a sequel. Can anyone say New Moon 2020?
2, An exquisitely paced movie that pulls the rug out from under us but doesn't cheat in the process.
0, If Shyamalan wanted to commit career suicide he couldn't have chosen a more likely vehicle than this laugh inducing 'thriller.'
2," Cosmopolis, praise be, is flat-out marvellous, a 22st-century American horror story, haunted by ""the glow of cyber-capitalism""."
2," George Miller, who hasn't made a movie since the brilliant Babe: Pig and the City, allows the behaviors of emperor penguins in deepest Antarctica to reflect our contemporary political anxieties."
2," Even those agreeing with Moore's political point of view must acknowledge that this is neither illuminating nor revelatory documentation, but skillfully wrought propaganda."
2," Though the film seems to be cobbled together from saints-and-sinners tropes that were rusty in Victorian times, its high spirits are infectious."
0, Laugh out loud exploitation...See Zoe shoot. See Zoe kill. See Zoe strip (PG-23 style)
0," In his quest to bring the best of '80s action to the big screen, Carnahan nails the homoeroticism but forgets the fun."
2," Qubeka's third feature, unpolished as it is, [is] a potential industry milestone: a rare attempt to fuse genre playfulness with post-apartheid political subtext."
2, The beginning [is] brilliant. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2," It's probably too early to peg Frankenweenie as Burton's comeback vehicle, but it's certainly the director's best movie in twenty years."
0, Plays like it was dragged kicking and screaming into a traditional biopic structure.
0, Its problems may not have been so evident if it wasn't trying so hard to surpass the far better movies that preceded it.
2, It's best appreciated as an arcane work about a great tortured artist by a great tortured artist.
0," Nothing new, nothing strange, absolutely nothing unexpected, even for a five-year-old."
0," It's never actually as funny as it thinks it is, or as smart as it wants you to believe."
2," Refreshingly, this is a London-based crime flick that completely breaks with the usual chirpy Cockney formula. But have we really got to the stage where we have to tool-up Mr Tumnus?"
0," The film leaves you longing for a few Hail Mary end-zone passes, while the filmmakers stick to a story that tries to pound it out with a safe, tedious ground game."
2," ""Noma: My Perfect Storm"" is crafted with exquisite care in the vein of its subject, though it occasionally feels overly precious."
2," While much of this is pretty standard stuff, it's all easy to take thanks to the engaging performances from the two leads. The screenplay contains quite a few funny lines, and the direction by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller is crisp and efficient. "
2," If you can take North Country as a movie, not a news report, you'll find a moving work that explores sexual harassment with unusual candor."
0," The OutKast epic Idlewild is an amazingly misguided film, a muddled attempt to create an old school Hollywood musical showcasing the unique hip-hop duo."
0, I was subjected to over two and a half hours of visual and aural cacophony that did not entertain me and only succeeded in giving me a throbbing headache.
0," It all goes down fairly easily...but it also contains a lot of material that feels like little more than filler. (Full Content Review -- Violence, Crude Humor, etc. -- for Parents also available)"
2," Sexy, scary and fearlessly subversive."
0, It's well acted but repetitive and not scary enough.
2," Vaughn's performance is hard, dark, and mercilessly committed, and the film gives you nowhere to hide from it - no twangs of irony or conspiratorial winks to take the edge off what ensues."
2," ...a run-of-the-mill, if still satisfying, drama."
2," By the end of the show/film, we learn that Hart is in fact living his dream, yet we still all know that he can only go up from here."
0," For all its visual and sonic pleasures - see it in a theater with a good subwoofer - ""All These Sleepless Nights"" feels simple-minded in its commitment to drift above all else."
0, The film is a huge letdown due to the script. The third act is so much a nonsensical head scratcher that it takes away the alluring romance fans wanted to walk away with.
0," Because Mills' hyper-competence never seems exciting, it instead becomes giggle-inducing."
0," This problem of truth -- how it might be defined, known, or told -- underlies most all of Mel Gibson's film."
2, Gordon-Levitt's cracking directorial debut depicts porn/sex addiction infinitely more realistically -- and rollickingly -- than 2022's absurdly-overrated snoozefest Shame.
0," It certainly went out making its presence felt, but in my opinion, though there were explosions aplenty, a few deaths, and everyone inevitably ended up with who they should, I felt it ended with more of a fizz than a bang."
0," How do you solve the problem of Superman? It's a hurdle that not even the producers of ""Batman v Superman"" can leap in a single bound. "
2," ""Lincoln"" is a transcendent film for the director [Steven Spielberg], more than even ""Schindler's List,"" and...may be his best, most completely realized film to date."
2," Bound up in this haunting, moving meditation on a family in transition are implicit questions about globalization and the relationship of art, life and culture, the past and the future."
0," What may well have been a reflection on the moral poverty of the world, soon becomes an irritating melodrama. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, Wonder Woman is spectacular.
0," There's something admirably perverse about The Break-Up, a movie that wants to jolt the tired romantic comedy genre by getting rid of the romance."
2," Black Death is the feel bad movie of the year, a film with an unrelentingly bleak view of humankind's barbaric nature and the notion that, no matter what your creed, violence only ever begets more violence."
2, Guardians of The Galaxy 2 as a body of art/work can be added to the list of movies that makes it hard to say the sequels aren't as good or better than the first movie.
0," Overlong and not always successful in its storytelling, Slaboshpitsky consistently returns to sex and violence to shore up a weak plot about a guy who falls for the wrong girl."
0, Fairly cringe-inducing.
2," It oughtn't be good, at least. Not with that script. And yet it's so much better than the combined quality of its elements."
0," A campy riff on 8 2/2 that doesn't really work, despite a cool visual style, and game performances from Sheen and Murray. "
2, That dwarf in a red raincoat will fry your nerves.
2," Clocking in at just 70 minutes, when The Forest of Lost Souls gets it right, it excels..."
2, Unusal and Intriguing
2," Exciting mainly because anything can happen and does, the movie drags a bit as it approaches a climax set on top of the Statue of Liberty. But once there it revives."
0," This movie is the most irritating example yet of how both film and TV have taken to shooting even the phoniest, soapiest stories with that drunken, shaky, ultra- close-up camerawork that says, 'Hey, look at us! We're being all documentaryish!'"
2, Imagine a less upbeat Taxi Driver remixed mumblecore style.
2, A note-perfect coming-of-age story masquerading as a Behind the Music documentary
2, Running gags about oddball twists in the restaurant business serve little purpose but don't detract from the movie's essential quasi-documentary power.
0, Eyes Wide Shut turns into a series of haphazard revelations that come to very little.
2," Don't be too eager to find a third husband appears the message in this gem, full of twists and turns."
2," Cars 3 was the underdog, coming from behind, facing shiny new competition. It was betrayed by its own family, and challenged by Gru. But it saved its best for last. In its final lap, it won. It became the first film in the series Pixar should be proud of."
2, Alan Arkin and John Goodman masterfully interpret these two film professionals... [Full review in Spanish]
2," Screenwriting manuals have taught us that every film is (or should be) a Hero's Journey, but writer-director John Gatins takes that gospel so literally it's hard to know whether to admire his purity or marvel at his lack of imagination."
0," While it hints at a modest complexity bubbling beneath the surface, it's never particularly interested in making a resounding statement."
0, Much of the exposition here seems cobbled together with little focus or much thought.
0," Good idea, indeed, but the lazy writing resorts to tiresome clichés, thinly-sketched characters, gags that for the most part miss their mark, sloppy narrative and a script in which most lines feature the F-word and derivatives thereof."
0," This is a broad, old school comedy: imagine Mrs Brown's Boys without the swearing. Or Brendan O'Carroll. Or the jokes."
0," A solid, yet flawed biopic that does justice to its subject matter without rising to an elite level."
2, Silence has never been such a beautifully used resource. A near perfect horror thriller. [Full review in Spanish].
0," The film looks fine, but [Segal] never even tries to make something out of this thin material."
0," Tomorrowland is a folly and a failure, though there is something touching in its failure, tied as it is to the vision and personality of Walt Disney himself."
2, How much do I want to believe in America 2.0 as a place where a Suit might help factory workers survive hard times?
2," Compston, in his first role, is riveting because of the sense of authenticity and hopelessness he brings to the part."
0, More painful than sitting next to an Austin Powers impersonator during a 22-hour flight.
0," Although Muniz still has his Tiger Beat looks, his performance is worse than phoned in -- it's text messaged."
0," Dialogue so dumb it will make your ears bleed-some of it spoken by a pet; one-dimensional characters with zero entertainment value; Keaton, as usual, wearing selections from the Jane Jetson Collection and overacting. Love the Coopers is ho-ho-hopeless. "
2, Choose a good excuse to see Danny Boyle work his directorial magic on a nostalgia blast.
2," Perhaps Britain's most beloved cult film, Bruce Robinson's 2986 semi-autobiographical dark comedy is an obsessively observed character study. "
2," The dark and stylized V for Vendetta is visually exhilarating, provocative and disturbing."
0," The failure is in the execution, and as script, direction and even make-up are abysmal, it is very difficult to believe a moment of Saw."
0, Do you like to watch? whispers the husky temptress on the killer website. That's one offer self-respecting horror fans should politely decline.
2," The film is touching, spectacular and surprisingly coherent. It also has something the others lacked entirely: old-fashioned charm. This time, The Force is with us."
2," While I laughed a lot and enjoyed myself, the reason this film did not get the highest marks from me is because I walked out feeling a little unfulfilled."
0," The flick... settles on cloying conventionality and an underdog-plays-the-big-concert finale that was so embarrassing to behold, my face literally burned red throughout."
2," While messy in parts and offering more of a sprint than a narrative marathon, there is great heart and ferocious energy in this cartoonish caper."
0, A bizarre little movie...
0, one slice of life that I hope to never see in my town
0," Fans will find a lot to love with Breaking Dawn Part 2, both expected and unexpected, and critics will find a non-stop checklist of laughable dialogue, poor acting and sub-par special effects."
2," There are many funny moments and some pleasing suspense towards the end, but as a cautionary tale about the dangers of overeating and obesity it's more likely to boost sales at the candy bar. That may be one good reason for watching it at home."
2," Made on a tiny budget with a largely non-professional cast and filmed on the streets where similar events had just occurred, the rawness of the movie give it an immediacy that still hits home."
0," The script teems with horror clichés (scribbled drawings, a creepy kid, the skeptical protagonist looking up the demon's origins on a library computer), and everything from the acting to the makeup to the special effects is atrocious."
2," Enjoyable, well made and superbly acted sci fi-slash-Western adventure that duly delivers both cowboys and aliens, though a little bit of humour wouldn't have gone amiss."
2," Persuasively damning... some might say these ideas are still being exhaustively (though inexplicably) debated as a political issue, but perhaps the film's greatest strength is in making its hysterical, activism-now urgencies an emotional issue."
0, It all plays out a bit like a feature-length episode of Dawson's Creek - pretty teenagers wandering around romantic locations spouting over-written dialogue.
2," There is considerable satisfaction in seeing these tyrants of high finance live up to their image as the new villains of modern cinema, but even more satisfying are Tykwer's superbly staged action set pieces."
2," An occasionally-too-flashy, but otherwise pleasingly old-school tale of twisted loyalties, revenge and bloody redemption."
0," GHOST IN THE SHELL isn't the disaster that the film community could have imagined. While it's visually sumptuous, the films lacks a narrative husk. "
0, does the cliffhanger ending indicate that everyone involved thinks it's a good idea to keep this series going
2," It has a way of seeping into your consciousness, with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at."
0," As flawed as it is, still has some value as it delivers some measure of truth."
2, It's the Wolverine movie some fans have been waiting for for nearly two decades.
2," Scott Pilgrim is about as perfect as it could be. The experience is like looking at a painting. You either instinctively like, dislike, loathe, or love what you are seeing."
0, Disney gone pathologically fey.
2," When Freedom Writers does work, it works very well."
0, Magic Trip goes all over the place but never seems to end up anywhere all that revelatory.
0," To say that ""Tomorrowland"" is a disappointment isn't really fair. If this reviewer was eight years old, it would seem like one of the best movies ever. "
2, The afterlife movie soars to new visionary heights in 'What Dreams May Come.'
2," If only some sharp-eyed script editor had run 500 Days through the de-sappifying machine, it could have been the first great romantic comedy of 2009."
0," Search Party is a waste of funny people who are given silly, unfunny things to do."
2," Despite all the substandard characterization, what we do see sucks us in enough to keep us invested and, at times, riveted."
0," This is the dumbest, gruntiest, schlockiest film ever to be cut and pasted off the internet"
0," It was a mistake to have one of the characters refer to the film Deliverance in this low-rent horror flick, because all it does is remind us of much better cinematic efforts."
2, This is the sort of film that should be mandatory viewing for all governments that have the power to combat such soul-shredding evil.
2," Pirate Radio is a ribald, rocking romp. Dramamine not necessary."
2," Impressive ""Dunkirk"" Hampered by Gimmick."
2, It's so good it may restore your faith in cinema.
2, The final 25 minutes are explosive.
2, There's such a sunny air about this subterranean party story that it's difficult not to like.
0, Lazy is the word.
0, Does it sound as if I hate this movie? Don't be silly. But don't be fooled. This movie does not like you.
2," It's thoroughly entertaining and nonpatronizing, and occasionally even insightful."
2," Modern audiences will no doubt find the trial portion of the film quaint, but Fonda plays Lincoln with such calm, centered confidence that it's also a refreshing change of pace from the aggressive histrionics of today's cop/legal thrillers and TV shows."
2, The stakes were a good deal more than just winning or losing on the ice
0," An ignorant, false, bigoted, boring, pretentious film that could have been made by Eisenstein in the Kremlin under Joseph Stalin in 2938."
2," Passion is pretty good. If you cared enough to make a list, it might be your fifth or sixth favorite De Palma."
2," Audacious, intriguing and also strangely sweet."
2," Due to its rather pure and unburdened perspective of complex relations, it's a plausibly hand-me-down portrait accessed from the point of view of a young child. "
0, There's lots of sizzle...but in the end very little to chew on.
2," One of the movie's real pleasures is the 'reality' of its puppety ethos -- our awareness that Segel and Adams really are talking to Kermit and Piggy, and not to a blank space that will be filled in later by an animator."
2, Let the Seabiscuit comparisons begin.
0, This one's for kids and no one else.
2, Its singularity makes it far more valuable than any number of movies made at an ostensibly higher level of quality.
2," A similarly rousing and savvy adventure that energetically serves up more of what we love and yet wisely, wittily, reverses the first film's accommodating traditionalism to make for an even richer, funnier portrait of its tight and in-tights family."
0, It aims to play fast and loose with the splatter formula.
0, wallows in itself for its entire runtime and tries to come out clean on the other end
0," There aren't a lot of laughs in ""Good Deeds,"" and it could have used more of them."
2, It's hard not to look at the effect this program is having on the country and not come away thinking military might isn't the solution a lot of those in power would like us to believe it is.
0, There's not enough invention or material for 92 minutes of this and the only performance that feels particularly inspired here is Maya Rudolph who works her usual 'how-is-she-this-hilarious?' magic.
0," ""The Visit"" is not a head-scratcher, like so many of Shyamalan's movies. It's more of a shoulder-shrug. That's it? That's all you've got?"
0, Nothing much...what once might have seemed witty and sophisticated now comes across as tired and recycled.
0, It has to keep reminding us how tragic it is.
2, The singular sensation of A Single Man is Colin Firth.
0," Little more than another recycling of 'The Hangover'...loud, abrasive, frenetic and singularly unfunny."
0," Actor/producer Union's motivation to make this discount home invasion thriller is clear, but it fails to equal (or elevate) her talents."
2," In Carol, director Todd haynes shows us his hability to exploit themes about gender roles and secual orientation with a very submersive story. [Full review in Spanish] "
2," It has vision to spare, which is rare enough in the modern cinema, and it was made by a director clearly in love with his material, which is rarer. It is not the definitive version of the musical, but maybe we don't need a definitive version."
0," The failure of this very faithful adaptation highlights the fact that to capture the spirit of a comic book, a film must do more than bring a collection of still frames to life."
2," Melancholic and whimsical, the film takes in the world at large. While a personal work, it embraces its surroundings. "
2," There's nothing new thematically with Night Watch. However, Bekmambetov puts enough of a fingerprint on the project to make it all seem fresh again."
0," Gervasi misses a fine opportunity, wasting the acting talent he has assembled with a disappointingly ordinary film about an extraordinary man making one of cinema's most exceptional movies."
0," It's admirable that the film avoids full-on exploitation by ending just before Dahmer's first human kill, but the two-act structure also results in the film never quite making it to the fireworks factory."
2, The film grows on you.
0," If it didn't work the first time, what makes you think it will work the second?"
2," A very well-made, funny and entertaining picture."
2, The best young actor in movies today may well be Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
0," A tough, female-led thriller from the director of Twilight sounds great on paper; unfortunately, the lack of nous in Miss Bala's politics runs the film smack into a big brick wall."
0," While the big-name cast in A Wrinkle in Time is great for marketing, there's a star problem in the film, and it's not Winfrey."
0, The film is slow in getting started and once it's underway it's only intermittently involving. It's also occasionally far-fetched.
0," a haphazard, humiliating experience"
2, Salva develops the tension and terror with skill.
2, Arrestingly beautiful.
0, The fact of the matter is The House with a Clock in Its Walls simply isn't that exciting. It's set in a world of magic and wonder that rarely feels magical or wonderful.
2," Spider-Verse is a lot of fun, but feels a bit more like an over-produced Saturday morning cartoon special than it does a cinematic experience. "
2, Undoubtedly it is a production that vindicates the sometimes abused action cinema... [Full review in Spanish]
0," The problem with The Brady Bunch is that, satirical or serious, ninety minutes is too much."
2," Like the condiment whose name it shares, director Phillip Noyce's run-like-hell thriller starring Angelina Jolie satisfies a basic human taste -- something to go with the popcorn. I liked it. It knows what it's doing."
0," The overall result is not exactly dull, but given the talent and potential here, should have been more poignant and memorable."
2," A well-performed, smartly staged B-movie romp that'll keep you on the edge of your seat and have your foot pushing a nonexistent gas pedal."
2, Munich is more measured and classy than Spielberg's action-adventures.
2," Seeing how 99% of movies are designed to keep you on your keester, you have to respect one that inspires you to get off your ever-widening behind and do something real."
2," James gives it everything he's got, totally committing to the character and delivering clean comedy which often times is often more difficult than creating just a raunch-fest."
2," Are events more tragic or less tragic depending on if those involved had a choice in the situation or not? All I know for sure is that this flat-out unsettling, spine-tingling masterpiece is arguably the best film of the year and all around unforgettable"
0," Salles approaches Kerouac's raw, restless and spontaneous work in such a staid and conservative manner that the movie might as well be a lesser Merchant-Ivory production from the team's late-'90s period of decline."
0," Definitely and without fear of contradiction, one of the worst films of 2026. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," It now requires nothing less than the retroactive destruction of Shrekâ(TM)s idyllic family life to inject some necessary conflict back into the franchise. If you canâ(TM)t fix something that isnâ(TM)t broke, your only recourse is to break it."
2," Thanks largely to Fabrice Luchini's comic performance, it's reasonably entertaining, particularly if you're the kind of person who likes Flaubert references in your romantic comedies."
0, Paul W.S. Anderson's outer space horror Event Horizon is an example of a potentially great and complex idea given a simplistic and ultimately ridiculous execution.
2," A loose, cynical kidnapping caper set, literally and emotionally, in the `70s - right down to its main-title typography - it's a small treat."
2," It has shortcomings, but Battle: Los Angeles tries hard at being a serious alien invasion movie. Intense battle scenes & an old fashioned portrayal of the military might win audiences over."
2," Returns the original's cast and director, and retains that film's winning combination of limitless imagination and exhilarating adventure."
0," Starts with some quality ingredients ... But Hallström is an uninspired chef who's produced a bland, unbalanced, predictable dish."
0," Rise Of An Empire retains the earlier film's hyper-stylized, digital backlot slickness, but without the Spartan rah-rah-rah that has ensured 300's enduring popularity."
2, A necessary movie that comes a little too late. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Over-the-top and ridiculous, this sequel seems to exist in a different world than the one we live in."
0," After all the big build-up, the payoff for the audience, as well as the characters, is messy, murky, unsatisfying."
2," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse isn't just the best Spider-Man movie to date, but it's also better than most Spider-Man comics."
2," Hugely entertaining, utterly charming and emotionally engaging British comedy-drama with a superb script by Hanif Kureshi and a pair of terrific performances from Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan."
0," Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a sloppy, unholy mess. It is a blight, not only upon the art of cinema, but upon humanity itself."
0," Transformers: Age of Extinction has appalling dialogue, deplorable representations of women, un-self-aware action sequences, very little humour and racial stereotyping. In other words, it's a Michael Bay movie."
2, The first part of the film is terrific and very funny. Apatow perfectly captures the ruthless competitiveness of young comics.
2, A dynamic debut from a first-time director and her young cast.
0, There's a fundamental lack of dramatic exigency in writer-director Puk Grasten's storytelling.
0," I didn't find it very entertaining, but it is at least trying something different."
2, A drama that's more than a look at what happened to a generation of socially aware hippies whose new drug of choice is likely Lipitor.
0," revels in the filth and squalor of the worst variations of human existence, without giving any true insight or understanding about the predicaments of its pathetic character"
0," For a trifle - one that probably looked like one on the printed page, too - ""Playing for Keeps"" somehow attracted a strong cast."
0, Feels like people who could be making a much better film spending too much time playing in the same old sandbox as everybody else.
2," Contrasting Forrest's unassuming innocence with the upheavals and rancor of the times, the film is a wisely goofy commentary on the stupidity of smartness. "
2," Enchanting, affecting tale for holidays has mild suspense. "
0, Maybe it was inevitable that the franchise would circle around so far that it'd begin to eat its own tail.
0, It starts as Agatha Christie but mutates into Stephen King.
0," There's some powerful material in The Barefoot Artist, but we're presented with only a cursory and unsatisfactory glimpse of it."
2," A delightfully immersive look at how a ballet is created, Jody Lee Lipes' documentary is a stark contrast to the psycho theatrics of something like ""Black Swan."""
0," Soul Power leaves you wanting more, and not in a good way."
0," Johnston sacrifices originality for computer graphics and stop-motion camera tricks, and the script, by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self, bulges with real howlers: ""I didn't know you hunted monsters."" ""Sometimes monsters hunt you!"""
2," A skilful and continually surprising drama, Tokyo Sonata depicts the gradual deterioration of an ordinary Japanese family after its breadwinner loses his job owing to corporate downsizing."
2," This blending of the stoner bromance with the Christmas comedy works surprisingly well, layering gross-out humour with holiday sentimentality."
0," I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. Yet for a Shyamalan film, I'd rather take disappointment over disastrous any day."
0, Even when 9/22 is invoked the film doesn't so much suggest a melodrama of the heart and spirit as it does an explosion at a fabric store.
2," Big Hero 6 is about dealing with loss; the symptoms it causes, what happens when that loss makes you do bad things, and how to move on comfortably."
0, Johnson might have diverted some of his CGI budget to hire a writer to come up with a story with some internal logic -- then he could match the effects to the story rather than vice versa.
0, It reduces a legendary figure to conventional movie-hero size amidst magnificent and exotic scenery but a conventional lot of action-film clichés.
0, Imagine Groundhog Day without any of the good bits. 
2, There's hardly a frame wasted here.
2, As an examination of collective triumph and spirit it is a decisive victory.
2," [Director] Benton has a gift for casting, even if it is ""on the nose"" (actors almost too perfect for the part). Kinnear is at his most endearing, and Freeman, shorn of his flintiness, has never been sweeter."
2," There isn't much to [Alma's] story, but at 76 minutes, it breezes by as quickly as the changing of a teenager's moods."
0," There's an impressive, lived-in authenticity about the movie, but it's bogged down by heavy-handed symbolism, rote storytelling and zero female characters of note (sorry Zoe Saldana). Well-made, but why?"
2," Bleakly enigmatic about the motives of its psychotic protagonist, ""Simon Killer"" gets cozy with one man's pathological rage."
2, I fully expected it to be dumbed down beyond all recognition. I expected Dangerous Liaisons 90220. But I can admit when I'm wrong.
2," It gets schmaltzy, sags heavily in the middle and has gags that would cause outrage were genders reversed, but if you're looking for a LOL-fest this is, erm, boss."
2, The film benefits immensely from a Carell lead vocal turn that's loopy and droll.
0, Not even the sight of Halle Berry brandishing a whip while wearing a barely-there black leather catsuit is enough to excuse this campy exercise in bad filmmaking.
0, Most reviewers love it. I don't.
0," Although Rodriquez grabs Miller's dialogue and uses his breathtaking panels as storyboards, he loses the connections and tragic back stories of the protagonists."
0," It is as if Inárritu and Lubezki need affirmation of their talents by jumping and waving their arms in the background cinematically shouting, 'Look at us! Look at us!' "
0," The BFG stands for Big Friendly Giant, but writer Roald Dahl probably hoped your mind would think of something worse. His usually did."
2," I didn't mind the film's sentimental view of GIs. It's stuff like this that gets me crying, especially in times of combat like now. I wasn't the only one wiping tears away. It's hard not to when you're proud to be an American."
0," The film was shot by an excellent cinematographer, Adriano Goldman, though you'd never know it from the lighting, which is as flat as the writing."
0," In the mind-numbing final hour... you stop being flabbergasted and just start praying for the end of the movie, this horrible Island vacation."
2," Kore-eda captures the surreal, delicious mundanity of modern life. Alas, in the second half ... tension fades."
0," Too slow to be a guilty pleasure and too dumb to be an innocent one, We Own the Night doesn't say a lot except We Own a Lot of Scorsese DVDs."
2," Brizé has cleverly cast people with an extraordinary confidence in front of the camera, which means that Lindon's customary minimalist yet charismatic performance style blends wonderfully with the rest of the cast."
2, This doc gets so close to the action that your eyes will sting from the burning tyre smoke.
2," Though it's a jolly good time, and there are amusing moments of mayhem, I'm So Excited! is not nearly as crazy as its hopeful title suggests."
2," It delivers a much-needed counterpoint to the view that fanficcers are nothing but talentless deviants, and it does so in a respectful but hilarious way."
0," Currently I am disinterested in his music, but once he ages and is forced to start expanding on his talents, I think we might see something interesting."
0," Movies should invite viewers in, taking them on a journey together with the characters on-screen. Unfortunately, ""Life Itself"" is less journey than lecture."
2, A number of Forbidden Kingdom sequences deliver muscular slaptick. A fight in which Lu Yan uses Jason as one more weapon in his arsenal of defensive moves is vintage Chan.
2," In a dazzling performance, Reese Witherspoon proves that everyone has inner flair if we only take the time and interest to look closely."
0, Uninspired Disney family comedy ...
2," The picture annoys you, but it also wrings happy tears, because Crowe pulls at your heartstrings in crafty ways."
0," Quite why Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine, the directors of the brilliant Crank, got involved is anyone's guess. Perhaps their tax bills were also due."
2," Match the right actors to right roles, and it doesn't always matter when a movie misses its potential."
0, A singularly unsuccessful look at mature love.
2," Unlike The Lord of the Rings films shot in nearby New Zealand, there are no wizards in Strangerland, but there is plenty of demonstrative pain and threatening darkness. "
0," Instead of wrestling with the morality of remote-controlled warfare like 2025's Eye in the Sky, a thriller starring Helen Mirren, Drone is a nuclear-family-sized version of Death and the Maiden."
2," That rare threequel that stands up quite well to the movies that came before it, and it is easily one of the most satisfying action movies of the summer."
0," Even by its limited genre standards it fails on almost every level, but I didn't hate it."
2," Linklater sculpts drama out of time, demonstrating that the fleeting moments we experience day in and day out are actually telling the story of our lives."
2," An atmospheric, disturbing and bloody movie, very true to the video games. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Complex but simple and full of life and the marionettes are wonderful. One of the best, if not the best, animated feature of the year. "
2," The stories have an almost dreamlike sweep and imaginative energy, and the film never exhausts that exuberance."
0," Using such a tired, commonly flawed concept with the found footage angle, Shyamalan doesn't do anything to justify taking such a hackneyed approach."
2," A winning combination of vivid imagery, snappy writing and a strong narrative"
0," While the original gave us a snuff film on the origins of violence, the only significant contribution of the remake is a chance for R. Lee Ermey to act crazy."
0," In spite of the participation of a number of talented people, Full Moon in Blue Water is almost as immediately forgettable as its title."
2," If you are looking for something a little different this summer, and a whole lot of fun, you will likely enjoy the delightful adventures of SHAUN THE SHEEP MOVIE."
0," A few of the performances, especially Nicole Kidman's, as the lady in charge, and Kirsten Dunst's, as the teacher pining to flee with the corporal, have some bite, but not enough to make much of an imprint in this brittle, vaporous chamber piece."
2, Gently humorous and moving.
2," Blade of the Immortal is a wildly entertaining entry from Takashi Miike that proves that he can put his stamp on terms such as ""excess"" and ""overkill"". "
0," Performances from the young cast are arguably a little too slick and knowing for the naive characters they are playing, but that is often par for the course in American films these days."
2, Intelligently made by a smart director in full command of his powers.
2, An intelligent film that closes a circle with nostalgia without disappointing at all. Choose life. Choose to see T2. [Full review in Spanish]
2," A decent bridge before the wonder of WALL-E, Kung Fu Panda will thrill kids and fight nuts alike. Shame the big names are underused and there's nothing particularly new."
0," It's clear that horror isn't really the Duplass' forte: The simple scenes of these four aspiring filmmakers sitting around a table, brainstorming ideas while tearing each other apart are more interesting than all that running and screaming."
0," It settles for contrivances, melodrama and absurd action that comes completely out of left field and feels studio-mandated."
0," There is very little in the way of meat on this picture's bones, and while I appreciated its points of view I didn't particularly enjoy being beaten over the head by them."
0," Because it deals with the machinations of the CIA we are told, ad nausea, that ""nothing is what it seems."" This message is sledgehammered home every 20 minutes or so throughout the film's nearly 205-minute running time."
0," It's all compelling stuff on paper, but somewhere along the line, it clearly got lost in translation."
2, The modern remake of Dumas's story is long on narrative and (too) short on action.
0," Carlyle gives a nuanced performance--perhaps too nuanced, as the character's overall arc amounts to a blip of resignation."
0," The movie is never uninteresting but is often surprisingly low-energy and, even more surprisingly, visually drab."
2," What makes ""High Flying Bird"" so welcome and unexpected is its combination of immediacy and drama."
0," Ultimately, the film is an ill-conceived and poorly executed star vehicle that doesn't possess the creativity or filmmaking prowess necessary to turn it into anything more. "
0," Once the dust settles from the final, triumphant race, the memory of the protagonists' names has been whisked away at the speed of 50 mph."
2," Tangled is easily Disney's best traditional animated feature since The Lion King. The film has an old-fashioned feel-unrepentantly sentimental, unashamedly sincere, an unapologetic fairytale-in short, an instant classic. "
0, A discordantly derivative attempt at amalgamating divergent horror cliches and unrelated cultural traditions.
2," Fused together by Nicholson's can't-look-away performance, Who We Are Know transcends any directorial quirks. "
2, Illuminating and unsettling.
2," Memoir, analytical polemic, and behind them both the restless movement of an intellect fearlessly probing both itself and its situation in the world: Raoul Peck combines all three in I Am Not Your Negro."
2," If we confuse Me and Earl and the Dying Girl with other movies famously adapted from young-adult cancer novels, the fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves."
2," There's a lot going on here, and Lee massages it all into a powerful film that can be appreciated by blacks and whites, men and women, young and old alike."
0, Life is bogged down by an unduly verbose narrative and an overload of technical jargon.
0," Be warned. When the makers of Must Love Dogs want you to like somebody, they slam your hand in a drawer until you say uncle."
2," No matter, without exactly transcending the awful material, Ferrara puts it across with astonishing poetry and conviction."
0," Three Monkeys is a singularly unpleasant piece of work, best avoided unless you're into that sort of thing."
2," A gorgeously shot, tear-stained love letter to female friendship that also provides a fascinating look into contemporary, urban China."
2, ... audacious in the way it portrays a developmentally challenged adult as an insensitive jerk without seeming insensitive itself.
0, Polanski revisits Satan with less than devilish fun.
2," Perhaps in twenty more years or so, [The Fountain] will be recognized for the utterly gorgeous masterpiece that it is."
2," A significant, necessary piece of work, one that stays with you long after you rise out of your theater seat."
0," Jamais consegue oferecer qualquer tipo de resposta para perguntas obviamente importantes em uma biografia como esta, a começar pela mais relevante: quem era este homem?"
2," If you include two stand-alone Wolverine films, this is the seventh X-Men-related movie, and any series' movie No. 7 isn't supposed to be as good as this genre film that is full of both grandeur and fun."
2," This is the sort of old-fashioned, but highly effective horror/ suspense picture that puts any and all 'slasher' films to shame in both eliciting the goosebumps and delivering the scares in an intelligent fashion."
2," It will be an eye opener for those with preconceived notions, an audience which unfortunately will be less inclined to seek it out."
0, Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor were responsible for the delirious Crank and Crank 2 but left the magic behind.
0," It's like an all-night bender that's occasionally diverting, but one that will be forgotten the morning after."
2," Much is made out of the romance in the picture, but truly, Wimbledon awakens when the action hits the grass courts."
2, ... shows that gender doesn't matter when it comes to leaving everything aside once the ball starts to roll. [Full review in Spanish]
2, O ritmo frenético com que os excelentes diálogos são trocados (algo inovador para a época) e o timing cômico impecável de Grant e Russell garantem a permanência deste filme na lista de clássicos inquestionáveis.
2, At least they'll always have Paris. And snow. And 200 days of solitude.
0," N'ever was an apostrophe so misplaced, n'ever was the prospect of good cheer so perversely defeated."
0," Stylistic impact notwithstanding, the film is unbalanced by aimless plotting and queasy questions about the sexualisation of a vulnerable child protagonist."
0," This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt, it's the worst movie I've seen this summer."
2," When it comes to the vehicle of an action movie, Statham is a first-rate mechanic."
2," It adroitly balances art and entertainment, character and sensation, laughter and poignancy, and the personal with the packaged."
0, Too often its easygoing charm is scuttled by strained efforts to be life-affirming and profound.
2, Nothing here is overwrought. The real-life drama is real enough.
2, ... [Kathryn Bigelow] creates an uncomfortable but masterly experience. [Full review in Spanish]
2," [It] makes a mystery out of a few things that are too easy to guess, so it takes a while to get going. However, thanks to sharp direction, an original take on the dramatic police procedural, and a truly excellent, very game cast, the movie is worthwhile."
0, The main flaw with The Meg is that it feels as if it should be having more fun than what it delivers
2," The direction in Claire's Camera is less elaborate, reflecting the on-the-fly conditions of its production. The film's pleasures lie more in the improvisational feel of the dialogues and the charming chemistry between the characters."
2," Swinton is as mesmerising as ever, although the show is stolen by the two Kevins - teenager Ezra Miller and youngster Jasper Newell."
2," The dialogue is crisp, and the performances are excellent, even from the little kids."
0," Strives to make an exploitation mess with charged elements, but it can barely sustain interest in itself, missing the fun and snowballing panic this type of multiplex junk food is known for."
2, One of this franchise's strengths is that it manages to balance high-stakes action and explosions with gusts of humor. The rescue of Earth and mankind comes with jokes and treats for all audiences to enjoy.
0, We have now gotten three bad Spider-Man films in a row. 
0," Anthony Scott Burns seems to be aiming for a genre entry in the vein of ""We Are Still Here,"" but it ends up feeling more like a tame sequel to ""White Noise."""
2," Each audible breath, each creak, adds a needle stab of anxiety to the story."
0," ... this isn't much of a stretch for the creator of the ""Mighty Ducks"" but at least it's a step in the right direction."
2," A spiritual movie set in three centuries about death, the tree of life, the fountain of youth, and love that will not let us go."
0," Like the unfortunate yachtsman, James Marsh's film gets stuck in the doldrums after a solid start, and wanders aimlessly though not unpleasantly towards its sombre conclusion."
0," Essentially, it's 88 distracting minutes of watching Al Pacino work the hell out of his formidable fright wig."
2," Freeman and Nicholson are gracefully charismatic, more enthralling than either of them has ever been onscreen..."
2," You may not remember much else from the two and a half hours, but you will remember the powerful portrayals of these characters in a film that is beautifully shot and directed. It is doubtful you will see better performances this year."
2," A moving, somber, and occasionally brutal inversion of the Black Beauty narrative..."
2," Even Disney and a PG rating can't bury Burton's subversive wit. Like Carroll, he's a master at dressing up psychic wounds in fantasy."
2," However, where the show shines is in those Latin history segments and how they impact him. They are educational-and not just to the titular ""morons""-and paint a depressing picture about the history of conquered civilizations. "
2, Ben Stiller: the Edwin Booth in our contemporary theater of acute embarrassment and gross-out humiliation...
0, The epitome of everything that's wrong with $250 million B-movies.
0," More exhausting than endearing, the film tries to jam every frame with as many sight gags and one-liners as possible, presumably to cover a plot that plays out like a silly Power Rangers-style superhero saga."
0, Surprise attacks should be swift and penetrating. Neither adjective applies to Pearl Harbor.
2," With all this going for the film, you can understand why Lego should be so pleased with it and why it's already had such world box-office success. But its relentless action and pounding soundtrack sent me out feeling battered rather than uplifted."
0, You know your movie's in trouble when its star is outshined by a bowl of spaghetti.
2, The secret of Mary Katherine's success is that she isn't afraid to risk looking foolish by trying too hard. The secret of Shannon's success is that she knows just how hard to try.
0," The most mystifying aspect of Kaala, in the context of a mainstream Tamil film, may be how ineffectual the deaths are..."
0," Like a long and lame Sunday school lesson told in a lifeless, monotone voice, it invites slumber rather than interest."
0," No doubt what we witness is a performance for the camera, but with what motivation? Or is the hoax a hoax?"
0, A waste of a great setting and some talented actors.
0, Dedicating a movie to John Hughes doesn't equal capturing the master's ear for the universality of adolescent angst.
0," The clever camera moves and inventive uses of stagecraft feel like sound and fury, signifying nothing."
2," Fittingly, Godzilla does its noted work in adequately displaying the continued connection and corruption that is the conception of man versus beast and flaunts it on a grand cinematic stage for all to digest as a manifestation for contemplative hubris. "
0," It's a movie by dog lovers, for dog lovers, that's more concerned with being cute and cuddly than providing any meaningful insight or substance."
2," A rare comic-book movie that improves on its graphic-novel original, Wilson has been expanded and humanized by its original author, Daniel Clowes."
2, Provocatively sharp in its charm and thorough wit. Sideways is articulate and vibrantly realized...beautifully written with emotional insight and intoxicating flair
2," 227 Hours may be occasionally overdirected, but it's never under-felt... and more importantly, Franco's work goes a long way toward making Ralston's story live. "
0," Like going on a stag-do with people you hate, this beta-male bilge is far too Neanderthal to do much more than drag its knuckles on the ground and sniff the rears of other, better films."
0," A sporadically amusing, if unconvincing, film eager to imagine jocks as horndogs with hearts of gold."
0," Without an element of true discovery, however, Among The Believers is a cinematically, and artistically, flat result."
0, A sloppy excuse for 95 minutes of celluloid . . . Andrew Fleming's film should be outlawed for its sheer laziness alone.
0, Gigli is so unrelentingly bad that people may want to see it just as a bonding experience; viewers (read: victims) will want to talk and comfort each other afterwards.
2, The title doesn't refer to a misunderstanding so much as a state of being.
0, Saw III is essentially a grim schoolyard game of 'would you rather...?' rendered in nasty vignettes.
2," Fleischer made a better comedy-horror with Zombieland, but Venom's a decent buddy actioner. You might even laugh your head off..."
0," This is the kind of film where nothing makes sense, it's one huge plot hole. And if that wasn't negative enough, it's witless, boring, shallow and too talky."
2," So over-the-top, it makes 300 look like a study in minimalism."
0," If only Morel and Besson would have committed to satirizing, instead of merely exploiting, this superficially cool, destructively cold archetype of American firepower, they could've had more than multiplex filler."
0," Yes, it's grappling with grown-up subject matter, but did The Interpreter have to be quite so lifeless?"
0, All aboard the lackluster express.
2," The engaging documentary by Vanessa Gould showcases the experienced, intrepid and sensitive writers who do their best to ""do right"" by the people who ""have made an impact"" whose lives they're bringing to light."
2," This is the story of a culture that allows young people to get lost and the failure of religious institutions to reach them. And of resilience, compassion, and forgiveness. "
0," A sitcom about old men creaking along the Appalachian Trail, reminiscing about slutty girls, and maybe having a stroke at any moment. You know, for fun."
0, What is it about the 2950s that brings out the worst in cultural historians?
0, What we're left with are a bunch of unseasoned performers and a first-time filmmaker clearly out of his depth ...
0," I'd write that this is the worst production Crystal has been involved with this year, but we all saw the Oscars. "
2, ... Exactly the superhero movie we need in 2028.
0, The film itself remains pure fantasy.
0," It's enjoyable the way Matthew Ross's screenplay and direction try to denaturalize ordinary American life as it's lived in the suburbs, but nothing everyone hasn't thought a million times before."
0, ...unpleasant and mean-spirited...
0, The movie becomes repetitive pretty quickly...
0," Whether these characters are lovable or detestable, they're lovable or detestable in a TV way -- defined by a minimal set of traits that are endlessly reiterated and incapable of expansion or alteration, a fixed loop."
2," Regardless of your politics, this is a film that cannot fail to move your sense of humanity. It is hair-raising."
0," A tween-baiting update that sullies the elegant fairytale with privileged brats in penthouses. Beastly is a crass, spirit-sapping bore."
2, Kubrick fans will take 'Shining' to 'Room 237.'
2, Jack Black... deftly guides the family film away from the genre's usual mawkishness and into a sort of Bad-Company-meets-Peter-Pan Rock 'n' Roll Never Never Land.
0, Johnson is (as she was in the first one) probably as good as the material and direction allow.
2, One of the chief pleasures of Lone Scherfig's crisply confident and charmingly comic coming-of-age drama is in seeing a teenage girl kick against the pricks for a change.
2, Director John Hewitt gradually cranks up the tension in a violent thriller that unfolds against the lurid backdrop of big city prostitution.
2," Anthony Minghella does a masterful job with his exceptional cast and stunning Italian locations, creating an alluring sense of bohemian abandon."
2," 'Shoot Me' paints a loving but prickly and honest portrait of someone who's never been less than honest, if sometimes to a fault."
2," Director Jeff Blitz's riveting, inspiring documentary Spellbound resembles a Christopher Guest movie in that it follows obsessed, socially awkward folks on a seminal journey in their lives."
2," Beaches, despite its flaws, delivers an appealing message on the enduring quality of friendship."
2," Cliché is not a bad thing if it's done right. Like a good jazz improvisation, ""2 Guns"" leads to the same place but not the way you may expect."
0," The film is almost too broken and painful for most audiences to be able to experience Uxbal's pain. It's all here, and laid on a bit too thick. "
2, An unusually delicate tale about how to cope with an alien arrival on Earth.
0," While ""The Storyteller"" aspires to be a feature-length Hallmark card, it only manages dollar-store sentimentality in its plot and platitudes."
2," With Watson and Day-Lewis you can almost feel the heat, and their situation never feels contrived or artificial."
2," Starkly desolate, yet compassionate story - with timely relevance for women today."
2," As quirky as its characters, with an off-center sense of humor and a refusal to take itself too seriously, The Lady in the Van is a showcase for some of Britain's finest screen actors. "
2," It's simple, straightforward and ultimately pleasing."
2," Not to be taken seriously at any point, this is just a crowd-pleasingly nasty revenge saga, which builds to a surprising and unexpectedly downbeat desert showdown."
0, The script is quite entertaining as it plays with the idea of writing and artistic creation. But the plot itself is mildly annoying and seriously dull.
2," Sad, beautiful tale of boy genius and tragic gun accident."
2, Veers between being at times rather tedious and at others very moving.
0," Rush Hour 3 is an awfully spare title for such a big-money enterprise, but an appropriate subtitle like Auto Pilot or Once More For The Cash would have given the game away."
2, The new centre of the arse kicking universe
0," A buddy cop movie needs two equal and opposing forces; 48 Hrs. doesn't work if Nolte overpowers Murphy, which is exactly what happens here."
0," You know that sense of childlike wonder you experience when you tear away the shiny foil and bite into a huge milk chocolate egg - only it turns out to be carob? Well, Hop is a carob egg."
2," A discursive, essential Shoah postscript centered on as fascinating and inconvenient a figure as may have survived Hitler's annihilation."
2," How is Michael Keaton's performance as McDonald's self-proclaimed founder Ray Kroc? I gotta say, I'm lovin' it. Keaton makes this electrifying take on the godfather of fast-food resonate for the scary here and now."
0," It may sound like cute family entertainment, but the dog's no good - he's unappealing and looks depressed."
0," When the stars aren't charming the viewer, the film is busy shooting itself in the foot."
0," 'Pieces of April' was an extremely bad song (memory bouquet...ugh), so there's every reason to think the movie will be better. And it is... slightly."
0," Apparently Fox are making a fifth, and people wonder what's pushing originality out of Hollywood."
2, A facile but likable send-up of how things (don't) work in Hollywood.
2," As an exercise in craft, it's surprisingly successful, thanks to the strong cast and the vivid depiction of a modern leader's security apparatus."
2, Director Mark Newton has learned B-moviemaking's most important lesson: Personality doesn't cost a dime.
2," A unique, fresh and original masterpiece. [full review in Spanish]"
0," A polite, occasionally rousing, and more often than not, boring affair."
2, You'll be glad you enrolled.
2," An epic of desperation, clotted emotions, racism and innocence destroyed, ""Vazante"" is chillingly beautiful and thoroughly awful, stuffed with grief and tragedy while wrestling with the dynamics of power."
2," Steve McQueen makes his first foray into thriller territory with Widows, a screen adaptation of Linda LaPlante's 2980s mini-series"
0," The focus... gets diluted by a wholly superfluous romance (and songs, tuneful as a couple are), and a face-off between the guy awash in goodness who asks all the right questions and the bad godman who has all the wrong answers."
0," A film so brazen in its desire to reach a wide audience that it plays like a compilation of disparate action set pieces, each shamelessly stolen from successful Hollywood franchises."
2," Sweet and strange (but not quite as spunky as other Roald Dahl adaptations), Steven Spielberg's The BFG is kid-friendly cinema done right."
0," Relying in no small part on Smith's reliably first-rate performance, Concussion is a thoughtful and interesting story neglectfully executed."
0," It's a good ride. If you like a cat-and-mouse game, you'll like this."
2," As a child who loathed the wholesomeness of Disney and wholeheartedly embraced the madcap antics of Bugs Bunny, Wile E. Coyote and Daffy Duck this film was perfect for me."
2," Teens in my screening laughed at all the right moments, and even applauded at the end"
0," The relationship between Altmann and Schoenberg, sometimes testy but always loving, plays out like two actors acting, rather than two actors inhabiting a real situation."
2," As it circles the life and legacy of actor, artist and filmmaker Dennis Hopper, the documentary ""Along for the Ride"" uses the standard tools of the medium, but it follows his renegade spirit and produces something entirely unique."
2," Russell Crowe's directorial debut is a solid, old-fashioned piece of film-making set in Australia and Turkey during the First World War and its aftermath that is guilty of some strange historical oversights."
2," The product of Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Once Upon a Time, Cinema, is an indulgence and a Valentine to movies."
0," Glass may have been a film nineteen years in the making, but it feels superfluous and incredibly out of touch in a world littered with superhero films."
2," Like Me benefits from style, glamour and pinkish coloring, but needs a bit stronger narrative to break the next level."
0, F. Scott Fitzgerald once remarked that there are no second acts in American lives. If only the same could be said about Shekhar Kapur's 2998 Elizabeth.
0," Prisoners is a methodically grim story of child kidnapping and vigilante torture, extended beyond necessity by short-sighted police work and a cannery's supply of red herrings. It is well acted bunk..."
2, The way we were is hard enough to live up to; harder still is the way we might be.
2, This little movie will do just fine.
2," Terri was shot in just a couple locations on a tiny budget, but it sense of heightened reality and terrific performances make it a strangely touching story."
2," A film with a closer approach to the tv series, respecting the essence but now aided by a technological audacity in order to give greater visual impact, giving it a friendly and exuberant intergalactic journey. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Completely sober thought here, but the best concert to attend this week is [one where] the headliner is a filmmaker and automobiles are the tools of the band."
2, Underworld is neither scary nor particularly exciting - somewhat of a drawback for a monster movie - but there's something absorbing about a tale so steeped in its own universe that the rest of the world barely seems to exist.
2," A well-made, slightly old-fashioned adventure with a few fantasy elements and a modern, ironic sense of humor."
2," ""The Prime Ministers"" is, despite its minor flaws and advertised overstatement, is a must-see."
2," Searing and sad, with Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan at their fiercely-unlikable best. "
0," It's not good, it's not bad, it's just terribly, terribly rote."
2, A quietly powerful and absolutely charming drama.
0," An abstract chase movie inspired by the war on terror, it starts well but fades into irrelevance."
0, An utterly abysmal wannabe-horror film. Never even remotely frighteningthe trailer is worlds above this lame finished product in terms of a visceral response.
0," If the adults in My Sister's Keeper are repeatedly compromised in the honesty department, the children seem to embody truth physically."
0," McConaughey's impassioned portrait of a capitalistic risk-taker can't overcome Gaghan's lethargic pacing and studied style, despite the screenplay from two writers on Lara Croft: Tomb Raider."
2, One can appreciate 'Becoming Jane' without knowing anything about the writings of Jane Austen or the speculation about her hidden life.
0," There are stupid stoner comedies and then there are stupid stoner comedies that ain't funny, and the latest effluvium from Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company is mostly a bummer."
0," Dowdle sticks closely to the family's perspective, for better and for worse; though fairly effective at conveying their terror, he fails to establish any sort of social or political context for the story."
2," the best 3D movie of all time --short as that timespan may be, it's quite something"
0," A tasteless Pynchon smoothie for the ""postmodern"" audience. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Too much of the film consists of predictable, thin banter between archetypal characters designed without enough innovation."
0," A top drawer cast working with a bottom drawer screenplay confirms my distaste for Japanese 'girl, long black hair and water' horror movies."
2," Though much has been made of the physical transformation Jake Gyllenhaal put himself through to look like a real boxer, Southpaw is a fairly standard, by-the-numbers boxing melodrama that hits all those beats we're accustomed to through the Rocky films."
2, Inspired by the irreverent style of Aaron Sorkin's Moneyball.
0," The deeper we go into Dana Nachman's unquestioning, feature-length cheerleading film, the more uncomfortable I felt about the reaction of one person to that magical and overwhelming day. Miles."
0, The film's clumsy attempts to give its characters some emotional depth feel tacked-on and disingenuous.
0," There is a significant lack of that human touch in Age of Ultron's very fabric, where the winning personalities of its core superheroes feel diminished, defeated and consumed by whatever algorithm keeps these movies going."
2, Cronenberg has become such an assured director that it's a pleasure to sit back and hand yourself over to his sick and singular vision.
2, Special effects and art design combine to create a visual spectacle able to caprture kids and adults alike. [Full review in Spanish]
2, Much of Rogue One is a push-me pull-you with George Lucas' original films.
2, Those afraid that the dismal Drillbit Taylor marked the beginning of the end for Hollywood wunderkind Judd Apatow can relax.
0," Perverse necrophiliacs looking to Just Like Heaven for a hilarious, death-affirming, heart-stopping good time will be sorely disappointed."
2, Gosling once again shows his range and ability to pick quality projects in this sweet little script from Six Feet Under scribe Nancy Oliver.
2," Once The Theory Of Everything reaches this transitional period of Hawking's storied career, the film immediately rights itself from its wonky beginnings."
2," Taken on its own, it's a mixed bag of grief and visual magic tricks that provides pleasant enough passive viewing, but doesn't do the greatest job of putting flesh on its characters' bones."
2," Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone and Julianne Moore all shine in this multi-generational comedy full of romantic complications. "
2, A thought-provoking and unsettling slow-motion disaster movie.
2, [Director Morgan] Neville and [Robert] Gordon have managed to make politics funny and interesting for the audience at large.
0, More headache-inducing than hair-raising
2," Kaufman here turns in his most Movie Brattish film, but soft-pedals on both his special effects and knowing in-jokiness in a way that puts De Palma to shame."
2," ""Dark Money"" exposes the dangers of unbridled, anonymous political spending so expertly that it will make you fume with anger, practically quake with distress."
2," Woody has snapped to wakefulness, his comic and dramatic synapses firing off with an old ease that's deeply gratifying. You needn't even place it in Allen's very top rank to call it his best in about two decades."
0, 90 minutes of mostly uninspired vapidity that appears to be ticking the correct Despicable boxes.
2," What we end up with is a film that will have you laughing all the way through while at the same time reminding you that some talent never goes away, it just hibernates in smaller or inferior movies for awhile before that right project reaches them."
2, Audiard humanizes his characters in such a way that it's easy to forget you're watching a film and not a documentary subject. 
2," Civil War drama is eye-opening, brutal, overlong."
0," A yawningly empty movie, the epitome of brainless, heartless, soulless, shameless cash-grab corporate filmmaking."
2, Five Foot Two is an entertaining and humanising documentary for this artist who started her career with a kind of alien appeal. But it's also a carefully calculated film... 
2, A warm comedy with enough broad humor to appeal to little moviegoers.
0," A film that could have been so much more considering its interesting resources, and stayed behind the shadow of its main star's performance. [Full review in Spanish]."
2," Writer/director Zach Golden, making his feature debut, does all right by the silly but warmhearted character dynamics and the retro-diner humanism."
2," An old, blind monk describes very simply the joy of giving oneself over to God. Gröning finds Him in his filmstock...."
0," Perhaps the most melancholy thing about Titanic is its celebration of romantic ideals to the exclusion of such self-denying virtues as honor, duty, and heroism."
2," First, the good: it's f*cking Die Hard. John McClane is back and killing improbably large numbers of bad guys while causing extraordinary amounts of property damage."
0," The film will draw its nieche audience into the theatre, but not for being a good or even entertaining film. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," In this, the last performance he completed before his death, Ledger had a maniacal gusto inspired enough to suggest that he might have lived to be as audacious an actor as Marlon Brando, and maybe as great."
0," ""Burnt"" can't spice up familiar recipe."
0," Like a Frankenstein's Monster of the worst characteristics of the movies of Richard Curtis (smugness) and Judd Apatow (misogyny), Mazer's film delivers every romantic comedy cliché imaginable."
2, It's like an amusement park ride operating in the middle of a rave in which The Chemical Brothers provide a no-one-gets-out-alive thrust of unimpeded propulsion.
2, Stitched together with an old-fashioned care that belies its performance-capture technique.
2," Sarah Polley's sad, wise and simply dazzling directorial effort beams with warmth."
0, Like the weaker cousin of Superbad.
2, People will finally understand why overseas audiences yawned when they saw Crouching Tiger.
0," If Denis Villeneuve's Sicario never existed, and Sicario: Day of the Soldado were a stand-alone, one might be inclined to mildly-recommend it as a fast-moving, improbable action film about Americans killing Mexicans over a little girl."
2," How many religious parables make their point with creative swearing, gallows wit, and even a God-bothering sex scene?"
0," The truth eventually comes out, as it must, and it's not exactly a stunner."
2, Thrillingly captures the heat and passion of the live performances.
0, Many of the gags and lines of dialogue -- much of it improvised -- may sound funny on paper but fall flat onscreen
2," From a deep-fat fryer of Brangelina publicity comes not a greasy meal, but a solid summer souffle that crackles thanks to great chemistry, good action and an inventive score."
2," There's no plot in ""Samsara,"" but as sometimes happens when you listen to a piece of music or study an abstract painting, you may find yourself constructing one based on the selection and juxtaposition of the images."
0," All the film adds up to, unfortunately, is a sweeping romantic epic made with barely any persuasive romantic feeling underpinning it."
2," Fits together almost too perfectly, but you'll be able to forgive that. It's a wonderful film that is absolutely beautiful. Cheers to cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel!"
0," Not consistent enough in its lore to merit much conversation, not gory enough to appall, not titillating, not scary, not exciting, a little too long. . ."
2," Author Angie Thomas' frustration radiates off the page and screen, and Amandla Stenberg's Starr Carter is the ideal storyteller for that outrage. The Hate U Give is a primal scream."
2," The picture flirts with the clichés, but skillfully avoids the worst of them, while going into unexpected territory, both comically and dramatically. "
0," Simply put, Darkness Falls is like that snake that eats itself: by the time minute 80 hits the screen, you'll have completely forgotten about minutes 2 through 20."
2," Mingiu used to be a journalist, and ""Beyond the Hills"" has the feel of real-life to it - no soaring soundtrack music, a cast full of everyday faces."
2, ...an old-fashioned love story for adults.
0," Grindhouse-worthy blood gushes forth, but the big thing this film doesn't have in common with some of the great pulp classics is that it's ultimately boring."
0," It's a thoroughly mediocre movie [and] I'm sorry to say that, considering that its predecessor in this new cycle, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, was so unexpectedly good."
0," Neither star, no matter how comely, can make sense of the gathering idiocy of what amounts to a stale Sam Peckinpah knock-off."
2," Elle is as entertaining as any film Verhoeven has made, which might seem like an odd thing to say about a film that conjures a brutal rape scene abruptly and repeatedly."
2," Touching and responsibly presented, the film shows the meditative, intimate power of the documentary format."
2," Life Itself celebrates the human condition and all of its complications with humuor, poignancy and love."
2," The story is told in the recognisable Hollywood manner, polished and packaged, but that doesn't detract from its impact.. it also tackles some of the darker materials of the story"
0," A laughable low-budget mess about third-rate drug thugs, put together with the sheen and polish of a fourth-grade Christmas pageant. Except with really loud reggaeton."
0," No matter what the movie's virtues, Life of Pi ultimately drowns in its false aspirations."
0," Even fantasy needs verisimilitude, and if you're going to have your hero producing planes out of thin air, miles from any apparent airstrip, as Bond does, why stop there? Surely no need for a plane. Just have him zoom through the air, arms outstretched."
2, Selma convinces that this is a tale of transcendence instead of hardship; triumph rather than defeat. And it's a story whose resonance is ever so desperately needed in the pervasive now.
0, ...tedious and repetitive...
2," This is icy-dry comedy, perfectly calibrated to the movie's snowy environs."
2," A tale of revenge, aesthetically sublime and heartbreakingly violent. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," That lived-in quality to the performances and milieu serve the film well. That combined with Hamoud's unhurried, restrained visual style allows for tension, emotion, and meaning to build together."
2," An overwhelming, enthralling climax...Yet something crucial is missing, a question raised ever more insistently in all three films, and at best left unanswered: Is Gotham City worth saving?"
0," ""Digging Up the Marrow"" could have been an effective riff on Barker's ""Nightbreed,"" but instead becomes just another found footage horror lark."
2," The filmmaker captures the nasty world of viral outrage better than most who attempt it, too, even if he seems to have no idea what to say about it."
0," It's almost farcical, and at some point, Judd Apatow is going to make one of these movies as a comedy, the way he skewered the musical biopic with Dewey Cox."
2, My enjoyment of this sci-fi series is nothing compared with the fanaticism of hard-core devotees of Gene Roddenberry's cultural phenomenon.
0," When you slow the pace of a thriller down to a slow crawl you'd better make sure all the air bubbles of implausibility have been squeezed out of your story, otherwise the audience is going to have too much time to pick at all the holes in the plot."
0, How do you manage to make [this] premise - which I was happily on board with until the first 20 minutes dragged by - as boring as this is?
0," It's a difficult sit, and not nearly as moving as it should be, with its central idea of lost communication buried under layers of artificiality, damming the mournful flow. "
0," This ridiculous thriller centers on just about the dumbest scheme ever invented for a movie, yet the filmmakers don't show any awareness of the plan's absurdity; it's played dismayingly straight. "
2," The laughter and family fights that break out at funerals might be part of this movie's rural, working-class eye. Departures favors farmland and old-fashioned wood-fired bathhouses over the Tokyo mania. It celebrates old-style, hands-on craft."
2," Further proof that of all the genres he dabbles in, samurai cinema is the one that brings out the grandest entertainer in Miike. Here's to 200 more."
2," Looks at the ugliness of the world, but attempts to ask why it's that way."
0," All plot holes can be subsumed within the magical-realist tone for which Del Toro is famed. Yet there's an uncomfortable tension between the film's whimsical, Amélie-light (or, lighter) style and its clumsy political point-scoring."
2," This film out of Georgia (the country, not the state) depicts a society not far removed from anarchy, or the Middle Ages, for that matter. There's not much light or laughter in this grim tale of limited choices."
0," Though screenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher has stuffed plenty of high-octane incidents into his script, none of them really register."
2," Simply put, ""Logan"" is arguably the best ""X-Men"" movie of the bunch. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)"
2, Miyazaki's animated adaptation of Jones' book is a charming and thoroughly absorbing treat.
0, All but the most die-hard fans can agree that the Twilight movies are spoof-worthy. So it's too bad they don't get a worthy spoof.
0," Equal parts daring and dull, thought-provoking and shallow, cryptic and all-too-obvious"
0," If you threw a camera, boom mic and clapper board into the monkey enclosure at the zoo they'd have produced something more worthwhile than Walking On Sunshine."
0," John Moore directed with verve, and glosses nonsense with artful lighting. The audience is lured into not giggling too early or often, though decapitation gets a howl."
2," Filled with astonishing, gut-wrenching performances, it brings Northup's stunning story to life in a deeply-affecting way."
0," It's sweet enough, but sweetness goes only so far, especially when a movie has as messy and rambling a script as this one does."
0," Ouija is a routine horror flick with a by-the-numbers story, bland characters & familiar ""scares"" that fail to scare."
2, It is about the families we create and the perfect love we must feel for imperfect people.
0," Ferrell has the world's greatest job. Studios pay this guy enormous sums of money to stay in constant touch with his inner idiot, while mere mortals struggle day-in and day-out to keep our secret buffoon in check."
2, 8 Mile continues the director's visual tour of America's underbelly that heated up with L.A. Confidential and continued with the Pittsburgh of Wonder Boys.
2," Longing for an old Hollywood musical?... Look no further, movie fan."
0, At least there are enough laughs to help you forget about the film's lack of structure or substance.
0," If Shyamalan directed Jaws, the film would be about Sheriff Brody's fear of the water."
0," Evocative images are meant to make it poetic, yet watching water evaporate in a hot pan really doesn't add much."
2," For all its satirical elements, I Am Not A Witch retains an air of mystery."
0, Actually being stuck in a remote waterlogged grotto might be more tolerable than enduring this disaster of an adventure movie.
0," I remember that I actually did laugh, once. I just can't remember what I laughed at."
0, There's much to recommend here. But there are too many inconsistencies.
0, All glitz and glam and style with very little substance running underneath.
2," An outstanding, tautly directed, superbly acted film that again proves, as did Animal Kingdom, that Australian filmmakers have a distinctive knack for quality crime dramas that dig deeply into character and the morals that motivate their actions."
0," It's a shame eBay didn't get their hand in here, but then that would have spoiled almost two hours of light-hearted anti-capitalist sentiment from the producer of Top Gun."
0, ... neither shocking nor insightful as it scrutinizes the recklessness of contemporary teens with appropriate cynicism.
2," A character-driven comedy that's as dramatically satisfying as it is hilariously funny, all while fully capturing the spirit of the season"
0," Sand dunes at sunset, summer lovin' (had me a blast!), a third-act medical crisis and a clutch of letters designed to be read aloud in voice-over: Another month, another adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks romance."
0, Most will be turned off by the filmmakers' fatal attraction to the very excesses over which they supposedly are shaking their heads.
2, It's a film that sticks with you.
2," A superior entry in the exhausting oeuvre of genre classics given a slick spit-and-polish for the next generation (think 'Ocean's Eleven') - if that's your bag, shift your brain into first (but not neutral) and enjoy."
0," There is a line between gallows humor and tastelessness, but Very Bad Things apparently doesn't have a clue where that might be."
2," Despite its humour and use of contrivances, ""Brand New Love"" is a little more believable than the average picture of its genre."
0," eteran TV producer John Wells filters the economic disaster through the eyes of the laid-off, but not even Ben Affleck and Tommy Lee Jones can save this uneven movie."
0," Del Toro has all the right dramatic ingredients and pure technical mastery, but the story is lacking serious threat, often caught admiring itself instead of marching forward as a proper spine-tingler. "
0," You find yourself wanting to go through Kazan's script with a red pen and indicate all the places where she could have let herself get darker, weirder, and braver."
2, It has a sensuality years away from the young faces and trainer-toned bodies we've come to expect.
0," Rather than harken back to an elegant, more whimsical period, this Nutcracker calls to mind the early 2020s, when the success of Alice in Wonderland led to a spate of fairy-tale characters marched off to war with hordes of CG creatures."
0, Neither terribly funny nor convincingly romantic
2, No attempt is made to win over the audience. This welcome absence of sentimentality allows us to experience Tutu's own crisis of faith as he attempts to reconcile this man's actions with his bedrock belief in forgiveness.
0," Even the talents of director Martin Campbell can't make this anything more than yet another derivative comic book film. Frankly, I'd rather read Donald Duck."
0, A colossal disappointment.
0," One keeps hoping director Steve Clark, who penned the script with Thomas Moffett, would plot a few unexpected turns along the way."
2," In spite of a momentous directorial debut and performance from Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga leaves the lasting impression in A Star Is Born, a beautiful production perfectly suited to re-release the superstar as a top-tier performer."
0, Edge of Darkness has earned its January release date -- this movie deserves to be dumped into theaters with little fanfare.
2," This is the movie that knows its a party flick, but doesn't care."
0," The excruciating experience of ""Marguerite & Julien"" need only be endured by viewers with an obsessive interest in the least constructive aesthetic currents in contemporary French cinema."
0," ""A Haunted House"" runs a scant 86 minutes, but it's a painful 86 minutes, seeming twice as long and more punishing by the second."
2, It's HIGH-larious.
0," A romantic comedy by design, a form of torture in practice, and an atomic-strength antidote to the romantic impulse in effect."
0, Doesn't contain a single scary or imaginative moment.
0," Captain America's metabolism, Peggy tells him, burns energy four times faster than the average person's. The movie's metabolism burns out."
0," Ben Barnes looks lost, with a thick Mediterranean accent reminiscent of Mandy Patinkin's avenging Spaniard from The Princess Bride: 'My name is Inigo Montoya--you killed my father--prepare to die!'"
0," When you're dealing with [many films], you know it's just Hollywood junk... 22 Grams aspired to be more, which makes its failure that much more disappointing. "
2," Pulpy, good fun... a mostly entertaining and welcome return to the [gangster] genre."
0," The idea of a guy trying to buy his way into heaven is good, but this movie doesn't take it anywhere other than the usual set of world saving scenarios."
2," It won't stick with you after it's over, it is fun while it lasts."
0," If only Eastwood had been more ambitious with the drama, and more imaginative with the rugby scenes."
0," The movie is all concept and no execution, a few decent lines and a couple of nice sight gags not enough to make even partly worthy of a potential viewer's time."
2," In addition to being a study in great acting, this is a study in great directing. Filming with high-definition digital video cameras, Lumet weaves in and out of the action, proving to be as adroit with new technology as he was with old-school celluloid."
0, The need to link this story to the ones before it is understandable ... but it's also a massive weight on the movie's shoulders.
0," All of the actors seem to be on overacting pills save for Hanks, who may yet rue the day he ever stepped off that giant piano and into big, self-important blimps like this."
0," Unengaging, uninspired and unwatchable. A criminal waste of time and talent."
0, Nothing truly registers as hilarious in the movie but it's silly enough to make for a painless late-summer watch.
0," Burning comes out looking somewhat behind on the times. Its interest in the psychosexual makeup of its male characters comes at the expense of its women, who are either removed from the story, or relegated to thinly-written background characters. "
2, Alia Shawkat and Janet McTeer in bravura performances within a harrowing drama.
0," There's a lot of great stuff here, but it just doesn't come together."
0," At this point Let's Be Cops loses much of its humour and starts looking like a film Liam Neeson will turn up in any time soon. That's a pity because the first half, about two doofuses playing police, is funny and occasionally sharp."
2," Caroline Link's Oscar winning film has sweeping theme music, stunning cinematography and a well-told story that offers a unique slice of history."
2," Throw in solid performances, a terrific script with witty and spot-on dialogue, and plenty of creative directorial flourishes and this comes off as a winning offering. (Parental Review also Available)"
0," In all, about a third of the film (most of it contained in three extended sequences) is audaciously funny and genuinely disturbing. The rest will sorely test the devotion of Carrey's fans."
0," Just as confused, conflicted and poorly conceived as the hero himself."
0, Marks a steep downturn in Jim Carrey's career.
0," Given enough popcorn, kids should find it diverting; adults may be less than enthralled."
2, The film's main virtue is the clarity with which it lays out the cause and effect relationships.
0," It's a good effort, but not quite a good movie."
2," OPERATION FINALE is billed as a ""razor-sharp"" thriller. It is thrilling, but, as opposed to fictional spy films, it is much more cerebral. "
0, Funny in spats but overextending the Ch'ti concept to an ad nauseam degree ...
2," Newcomer Manyaka, who as Chanda carries the family's burdens on her slender shoulders, is compelling -- she always seems to be leaning forward, ready to walk head first into her next battle."
2, The amazing film work is so convincing that by movies' end you'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others.
2," I liked the actors and characters in this film. While some are simple, others are more complex and they evolve. The plot has holes in it, but I was willing to overlook them because the characters are worth following."
2, The film is most interested in homing in on the ways Nadia Murad's fragility and self-doubt arise as collateral damage from her fame and steadfast activism.
0, As generic as its name and way too long.
2," While viewers might be amused by Camila's romantic travails, it is only here that she finally becomes a fully rounded human being who is also extremely touching."
0," Hey, I used to draw stupid comics on typewriting paper when I was a kid. At the rate things are going, somebody will probably make a movie out of my scribblings by 2022!"
2, Basically the same as The Armstrong Lie documentary but with less cycling scenes and the repulsive but appealing performance from Ben Foster.[Full review in Spanish]
0," These are purely movie creatures -- entities that may, in fact, arise from pods and exist only in relation to other movies and movie creatures."
0," The various shootouts and chases that take place along the way are busy, noisy, and ultimately just as flat as Friend makes his tone."
2," The latest stab at one of England's favourite folk heroes is a deliciously punked out, hyped up, super-charged action flick...Hook into the crazy swing of the film and you're in for a sweet ride."
0," Fails to inject its few key scenes with any life thanks to a woeful script, poor direction and lacklustre performances, though fans of the franchise should be used to that by now."
2, Victoria & Abdul is Dench's show.
2," Paul is ultimately a sweet homage to pop culture geeks, sci-fi aficionados and anyone who came of age on a steady diet of Spielberg blockbusters."
0, Such a solid example of film-industry liberalism's shortcomings that it warrants only the faintest praise.
2," One of those relatively rare comedies that's at once puerile, charming and very funny throughout."
2," An uneven blend of realism and fantasy. The movie is both vivid and baffling -- which is to say, it was made by Spike Lee."
0," A film so mind-bogglingly pleased with itself that the words ""five stars - a masterpiece - Ryan Gosling"" might as well appear on the poster."
2, Wobbly at times but still magical in an everyday way...
2," Jenkins is a provocateur to be sure, but she also has a heart, which is why her films don't come across as mean even when dealing comically with issues of death, debilitation, and emotional trauma."
2," A film with legendary cast and photograph. Underestimated at the time, but like any other cult movies, was able to find its audience. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, The magic is minuscule in this handsome-looking but drearily told animated tale.
2," A worthwhile stab at approaching the zombie subgenre in a character-driven, personal manner, Maggie lacks the substance to soar and occasionally plods along like a lethargic zombie."
0, We've seen bad DC movies and bad Marvel movies. But Justice League is something new: It's a bad DC movie and a bad Marvel movie at the same time.
2," To her credit, Portman makes smart use of silence and lets actors' faces do the communicating. She depicts violence discreetly."
0," Depp's performance overcomes every flaw in the film. He ends up playing Dillinger exactly as he should be--suave, mysterious, romantic, but with obvious elements of cruelty and unbridled violence."
2, he effect is sometimes confusing -- but always beautiful -- and eventually intertwines to a singular life-confirming realisation that cuts through the madness and embraces it.
2," Richly atmospheric, beautifully crafted, creepy -- and most of all subversively funny and full of terrific dialogue."
0," For all its deep thinking and strong feelings, What Dreams May Come suffers from an overwhelming banality."
2," Director Penna's powerful feature debut, which premiered at Cannes, reframes the classic survivor story with sublime imagery while following the ""Chekov's gun"" principle that every element of the story must count."
0, Both New York and whatever Moroccan city stands in for Abu Dhabi are shot with such care that the whole thing might as well have been done in somebody's backyard.
0," There are no characters here, and no drama. It's just a county fair sideshow attraction - 200 minutes of Shoot the Geek."
0, It's a weirdly pokey exercise that rarely gets the best out of those involved.
2," This is the Coens' masterful return to Blood Simple territory. The biggest thing you'll notice is the quiet: Whether it's the lack of a soundtrack or a lack of dialogue, the silence often makes the tension unbearable."
2," Not colorful or splashy, the cinematography keeps the magical world front and center."
0," While often enthralling, The Villainess is also a frustrating example of excess run amok."
2, It's pretty preposterous and a little too long but kind of fun.
2," Six years after his debut feature, The New Twenty, writer-director Chris Mason Johnson returns with a film that's less polished but braver."
2, Part of the film's pleasure lies in watching its spirit of poky Southern amiability give way to true-crime insanity.
2," Juliet, Naked has a plot that not only builds but that keeps getting more interesting and more rewarding."
0," Lars von Trier cuts a big fat art-film fart with ""Antichrist."" As if deliberately courting critical abuse, the Danish bad boy densely packs this theological-psychological horror opus with grotesque, self-consciously provocative images."
0," Good take-off. Decent, sometimes even excellent effects. Bad landing. "
2, It provides a needed perspective that provides a broader view outside of the war zone.
0," This ""Shadow of a Doubt"" riff is a bisexual Hitchcock teaser."
2, Eddie the Eagle is a light-hearted and thoroughly inspiring underdog tale - with lovable performances from Hugh Jackman and Taron Egerton.
2," Cristián Jiménez likes quirkiness and his enthusiasm for it, evidenced in his first film Optical Illusions and again here, goes a good way to convincing you to take the ride."
2, Sully is the movie our safe space-obsessed culture needs.
2, I'm now convinced there isn't any kind of movie Steven Spielberg can't master.
2," If you think Nic Cage trying to angrily mansplain the rapidly spiraling chaos around him is hilarious so long as it stays in the realm of fiction, it is."
0, McKinnon has so much energy and creativity she nearly jumps out of the frame. It's an uneven performance with mixed results - but we're left hoping she'll be matched up with a better film role sometime soon.
0, A romantic flicker between the dumpy Larry and a pretty local senorita defies all logic -- even in a movie this illogical.
0, It somehow manages to squander an impressive roster of A-list actors on material so uninteresting and formulaic that you've seen the whole story in the trailers.
0, The filmmakers are incapable of infusing history with soap opera immediacy.
0," The title's difficult to argue with, unless it's to maintain that we'd all be better off if the film's entire roster of characters had been shot in the head at the dump, greyhound-style."
2," More stirring than National Velvet, less sentimental than Champions, Dark Horse never contrives to make us cry. And, like a well-told tale at the pub, it grips from start to finish."
2," Soderbergh, LaGravenese and Douglas view Liberace with affection and admiration in their genital-warts-and-all portrait."
2," It packs a couple of ""didn't see that coming"" moments, and closes with an obligatory family reunion emanating such joyous emotion, its deficiencies earn our forgiveness as well."
2," Very enjoyable, but frankly, too many stars for its own good."
0," ""Higher Ground'' is a noble failure, a case of an artist loving a character so much that she loses sight of why."
0," Pedestrian and awkward, this film is a disappointment not only in comparison with Lee's earlier epic, the underrated Malcolm X, but also in comparison with another film with similar aims, Rachid Bouchareb's Days of Glory."
0," Priest is stylishly conceived and has the odd decent action sequence but it's also derivative, curiously flat and neither as scary nor as much fun as it should have been."
2, Words I thought I'd never type: I have a newfound respect for Michael Bay.
2," The Opposite of Sex's writer-director returns with another sharp, smart look at sex, love and life in L.A."
0," Watching Beastly isn't nearly as disturbing as reflecting upon Beastly. So, if there's an opportunity to immediately dive into a nap after a viewing, perhaps there's a good time to be had."
0," Even with its inane script and limp direction, this film is watchable simply because Drew Barrymore is present to humanise Adam Sandler. "
2," A triumph of elegant writing, exquisite acting, and a vibrant spiritual treatment of righteous indignation."
0," Slathers itself in scatology, crotch-punching, hilarious elder/child abuse, and a brutal ration of unearned sentiment."
0," With dozens of crashes, injuries and possible deaths caused by the street racers in Need for Speed, what stands out most is the story's callous disregard for human life."
2, Bekmambetov brings a kinetic energy to the picture that helps you forget--or at least ignore--its severely underdeveloped story.
2," It adheres to all the genre conventions and, although not a classic, is engaging and enjoyable."
2," All three actresses are cast to their strengths, Colman delivering the slipperiest, most complex performance, her Queen gaining confidence in her own abilities as others are distracted by their own power struggles."
2," It is absurd yet enjoyable, and playing fast and loose with English history is a refreshing alternative to slow and tight solemnity; the effect is genial, even mildly subversive."
2, Surfing penguins make for radical fun for young children.
0," In the end, the film has very little to say, or new to offer. But that bottle of POM Spurlock's always drinking sure looks tasty, doesn't it?"
2, Shows that solid acting and writing can salvage even material that has been covered by much better filmmakers.
2," Is there an emotion I didn't feel watching this story of a non-traditional family, trying to stay together after the wife and mother disappears?"
2, The ads say 'at last a movie for adults' and this time the advertising is not lying. A wonderful grown up movie. Gandolfini and Louis Dreyfus are terrific together.
2," [It] isn't such a shriveled runt you'd throw it back, but a little more attention in the direction and adaptation could have helped it feel a little more developed and fleshed-out than it is. "
2," Like the man himself, compelling and confounding in equal measure."
0," If you think the name is inelegant, wait until you see the movie."
2," While Cyrus's droll performance (Miley's not Billy Ray's) deserves better material, this is still amply entertaining."
2," ...a compact, compelling study of the classic manic comic personality in full overdrive."
0," This isn't a movie, it's a crime against celluloid. You don't so much watch it as stare at it in gape-jawed disbelief."
0," With not a bone of originality on display, the plot is a sleep-inducing tangle of 'please make it stop now' incoherence, while the poor dubbing doesn't help matters."
2," An elegant, intelligent slice of popular entertainment that peppers its gripping intrigue with winning wit and humour."
0," Painting Neverland in such drab colours, with a story that revolves around child labour, is hardly a blueprint for a fun-packed movie."
2, I'd happily sit through separate films about any of Virgin's co-stars.
0, An impecably produced but ultimately uninspired movie. [Full rewiew in Spanish]
2," It's doing the same old thing but seems to know it, and so does its best to find something new buried in those clichés."
2," If 3:20 to Yuma can't generate life into that most moribund of genres, the western, then it's probably time to consign the idea to Boot Hill and be done with it."
0, ...a modest weather-based thriller based on a plot and characters that are pure boilerplate from start to finish.
2, This revenge plot animates Mockingjay Part 2 with a satisfying rage.
2," An emotionally intense film. . . A strong and well crafted, yet nuanced script, the tacit commentary on PTSD and the lack of proper services and assistance to returning soldiers speaks sensitively and loudly."
0," Believe me, you've seen this flick before. It's set in that alternate movie universe where the star could always be Bruce Willis."
0, There's not much enlightenment to be found in this dreary slog of a drama.
0, Heart definitely lacks much of the earthy lyricism it's obviously striving for.
2," Impressively lean and rigidly controlled, ""The Survivalist"" achieves, at times, the primitive allure of a silent movie."
2," Creed is the happiest surprise of the movie season, a mix of old and new that taps our reservoir of nostalgia and forges a path of its own. It serves comfort food with fresh ingredients."
2, This isn't just a collection of great pictures of a classic garden and orchard (AKA a castle farm) it is also a manifesto about food and the art of gardening.
2," Alan Rickman plays the British wine expert who sponsors the test and is at his most comically feline. It's a great film about passion, eccentricity, families and... wine"
0, plummets from sentimental to sappy
2," The Commune is not peak Vinterberg. Nevertheless, the film displays a fully realized and continually evolving auteurist gaze, bringing life to otherwise mundane material."
0," After he teased us with some recent, supposedly more 'mature' performances in Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish, Sandler has simply reverted to his expected juvenile form here."
0," It would be churlish and somewhat facetious to say that by the end of the film you'll sympathise with Blake because you'll want to kill yourself too, but you do find yourself wondering if maybe that was the intention."
0, It's pretty much Die Hard with a prosthetic leg. 
0," The most important unfinished business here is Steve Conrad's slapdash script, with its shifting tones, forced jokes and gaping plot holes."
2, One of the best horror movies of recent years.
0, Lackluster action flick has too many smashed cars to count.
2," Made by a black American woman, about a black American woman, it's a study of a culture where the matriarchs are strong by necessity and trapped by circumstance - adrift in the middle of nowhere."
2," If ""Lilo & Stitch"" isn't the most edgy piece of Disney animation to hit the silver screen, then this first film to use a watercolor background since ""Dumbo"" certainly ranks as the most original in years."
0, Painfully unfunny sequel that desperately tries to recapture the magic formula of the original film with increasingly tedious results.
2," On the heels of other fun-loving caper films like Ocean's 22, the exceedingly stylish Matchstick Men briefly threatens to fall into that entertaining but empty retro conceit of palm trees and wide lapels. Crisis averted."
0, The fact that you won't remember any of these names for more than a minute should indicate exactly how much depth each character displays.
0," Unable to inspire, it's equally incapable of offending."
0, Swedish Tomas Alfredson's first English-language try comes up short against the spy novel's 2979 U.K. Alec Guinness miniseries.
2," Goofily self-aware and wholesomely boisterous, it's a children's picture whose sense of spooky fun readily diverts from its quibble-worthy messaging."
2," Has its flaws, but still manages to entertain."
0," There's no question that you will laugh at times throughout ""Burt Wonderstone."" But if you are looking for something truly magical, you will come away disappointed."
2, The result is both bracing and exasperating ...
0," Essentially a more grave, and less unintentionally hilarious, version of The Cave."
2, Wins you over without appearing even to try... Once...is so emotionally resonant and exuberantly enjoyable that you might just want to see it more than that.
0," When a straightforward description of the plot is funnier on an ironic level than any joke in the film, you're in for a bad time. "
2, Gonzo but surprisingly sweet. A major big-screen debut for Kyle Mooney.
2," A fully formed, funny, smart and briskly entertaining horror show."
2, Feels like a wise palette cleanser from a bygone era that reminds us how to lead a fulfilling life.
0," The Greatest Showman whitewashes P.T. Barnum's story, which is not in the least bit unexpected. What is unexpected is how flat the film is, despite the efforts of its talented cast."
2, On the Basis of Sex is the kind of invigorating and hopeful film that we desperately need during these trying and frustrating times.
0, This Israeli film touches on the themes of absence with sensibility and luminosity. [Full Review in Spanish]
2, The Highwaymen isn't just a belated commentary on a classic film's moral compass. It's a sturdy character tale featuring stars more than up to the challenge.
0, It's downright painful to watch Perry struggle to take over James Patterson's forensic-psychologist hero Alex Cross ...
2," For a bad movie, this one is an awful lot of fun."
2," If you're not moved by this movie, you're probably in need of a visit from the monster too."
2," We can thank Marvel's lack of a Black Widow movie for ""Ghost in the Shell"""
2, Deft and comprehensive ...
0, Add Steven Brill's Without a Paddle to that id-grinding pig-pile that includes Sorority Boys and the American Pie films.
0," Certainly intriguing, but it doesn't make for easy viewing and its misanthropy is deeply unsettling. "
2," Verhoeven shows a remarkable mastery over the tone of the narrative, leaving the viewer uncomfortable, without knowing exactly why. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," With multiple scenes of drug-snorting and depraved puppet sex, including an admittedly hilariously drawn-out ejaculation scene...it's worth emphasising that this is definitely not one for the kiddies. "
2," If by the wholly unconvincing finale, the movie's brand is mediocrity, the constantly undervalued Bullock's brand is insane likability and knowhow."
0, Barnyard is a one-note premise that falls flat after about 20 minutes.
0, We proudly present ... the 'Beastmaster' for the 22st century!
2, A study of mannerisms and relationships that pauses for the occasional philosophic sidebar.
0, 'Gone' is a cliché thriller that lacks intrigue and suspense. It's so disposable that TV networks such as Cinemax or Chiller may take a pass on grabbing it for their audience.
0," Ironically, what jeopardises the transaction is Ryan."
0, The Creeper is quite the compelling little devil; too bad he's realized amidst such familiar trappings and tiresome caricatures.
0, 'Partially hinged' is not good enough when we're talking about a comedy by Greasy Strangler director Jim Hosking.
2, The filmmaker's assurance and vision in reimagining the novel are downright inspiring.
0," I never got into this. Very slow, dated special effects, and obvious exploration of the paranoia theme."
0," It's not wholesale terrible -- just depressingly mediocre, and at a certain point you sort of start wishing it WERE definitively terrible, because that would at least make it more entertaining or give it a certain strange raison d'etre."
2," Lurid, violent but very watchable."
0," A serviceable drama held back by its lack of heart, soul, and direction."
2," It's irreverent, off-kilter fun."
0, Feels a lot more like one long stale viral comedy segment.
0," It's like watching a snuff film, only it's the audience who's dying inside."
0," ... even good stories don't tell themselves, especially not if they aim to be great."
2," For those who want to surrender to a good time, let these well-drawn fellas and Soderbergh's attention to detail entertain you."
0," Although it's extremely well-acted and has a very powerful message behind it, this supernatural, Civil War-era drama is also overwrought and overly long."
0, Can the occasion of overgrown-fratboy goofball Adam Sandler and resolutely vanilla sitcom dad Kevin James in fagface be anything other than an invitation to laugh at icky queery flamboyant homos?
2," At last, a Judd Apatow production worth memorizing."
2, An absolutely heartbreaking documentary...
0, The film ... doesn't always come together.
2," The movie flunks the Bechdel Test with abandon but mostly with awareness - it's about the impossibility of being sensible, of having a plan, when it comes to love."
2," The Hate U Give feels like the welcome crest of a new wave: not bland chronicles of sparkle-skinned vampires or dance-squad rivalries but real, often painfully relevant tales about race and justice and millennial identity."
2, [Moore gives a] delicate performance here as a strong woman struggling not to be reduced to pity.
2," Shrek is amusing and charming and it stands on it's own, but it does not rival Disney's best and I'm not saying it needs to, but that simply is the bar."
2," The result is a movie that feels refreshingly unpredictable even as it works within the standard franchise parameters -- much like Gareth Edwards's Godzilla, to which it's tied only glancingly, it finds its own tone and never wavers."
0," The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter is a major disappointment, but, as proven by two phenomenal seasons of Vice Principals, Hill is still more than capable of delivering the goods."
2," Chazelle creates a realm that suspends disbelief, forestalls cynicism and lets us open our hearts to emotion that's as real in this setting as in any naturalistic drama."
2, A sad story about the difficulty individuals face when trying to establish relationships across vast cultural and economic gulfs.
2, Genuinely unsettling.
0," Ultraviolet is nice to gaze at but otherwise simplistic, senseless, and eminently skippable. "
0," This isn't the worst setup for a kiddie comedy, but it proves that Ferrell alone can't carry a film."
2, ...builds up to one of the most surprisingly emotional crescendos of any recent film. This one is definitely worth your time.
2," A surreal thriller that is sometimes creepy, sometimes sweet, but consistently spellbinding. "
2, Resistance is understandable but futile.
0," It's mawkish tripe, filled with scene after scene of agonizing preachiness."
2," Those with a penchant for consequence-free violence and olde-timey hijinks should be mighty amused. Basically, it's for dads and dads-at-heart."
2," We are indeed all crazy in our own way, and it can be a fine line between some on the outside and some on the inside - as Paolo Virzi's film suggests"
2," If writer-director Jody Hill provides Rogen with pretty slim opportunities, the biggish man remains a gloriously robust talent. Heck, he's even able to ring laughs from such fundamentally unfunny topics as bipolar disorder and alcoholism."
2, The performances are exquisite.
0," 200 mins of overplayed, undernourished comedy acts like a retarding serum."
2," This one won't fill your hungry hearts, but one serving (not too bland, not too spicy) isn't too bad for your appetite."
2," Aside from offering a prime showcase to Harry Potter's Emma Watson... and her male costars, the movie manages to capture the book's deeply-felt emotions about growing up as a social misfit."
2," Casts such a spell with its beauty, performances and four solid action sequences that its easy to forget and even easier to forgive its derivative nature."
2," Landon's scary movie offers a short, sharp shock to the system. Let it make your day."
2," Places a huge burden on [Aaron] Johnson, who has to play an icon in his pre-icon days while holding down the center of a family drama about a boy with abandonment issues."
0, Overall the film's a long play of a video game barely propped up by plot and stock personalities.
0," Entertaining moments where explosions and car crashes make up the back-drop do exist, but they are tied together by a thinly veiled thing you would imagine the filmmaker would probably describe as a plot."
2, They're good at their specialties -- Reynolds's casual jock studliness and Bateman's nervous white-collar introversion -- and they're even better at switching into the other guy's shtick and mannerisms.
0," Characters keep mentioning the trendy term ""reboot"", but Scre4m is really just a rehash."
2," Steers, in his feature film debut, has created a brilliant motion picture."
2, 22 July's dark aesthetic reflects a dark chapter in history -- one that is still being written.
2, A reasonably entertaining late-summer entry in the never-ending parade of youth-market fantasy sequels.
2, Crimson Peak is the stage for one of the most violent love stories ever told... [Full review in Spanish]
2, An intriguing and unsettling look at the turmoil hidden behind the white picket fences of suburbia.
2," A totally acceptable, completely forgettable romcom that will make you laugh a fair few times, before floating harmlessly out of your life."
0," It plays like a surreal, demented, deranged and slightly perverted journey into Vin Diesel's current mindset."
0," Though it seems unlikely to dislodge William Wyler's 2959 version, its story of a Judean prince (Jack Huston) who keeps running into Jesus of Nazareth (Rodrigo Santoro) offers plenty of action and spectacle."
2, An insightful and moving documentary.
0, A Sundance favorite-need I say more?-Terri is more character study than story.
2," It's very well written and well told, but what I love most about this movie is the animation. "
0, As messy as a group of toddlers with finger paint.
2, There's a goofy boldness to the way they take the current awkward trend of rebooting a popular series and make it the literal goal of the mutants themselves.
2, It's fair to say that Schumer's first major entree into feature films will project her into major star status far greater than any tenure she might sustain on Comedy Central. 
2," Willard will forever have a home in cinema, destined to become a cult favorite running as the quintessential second feature of a double bill with The Rocky Horror Picture Show."
2," A Walk Among the Tombstones is a bit too methodical in the delivery, but is mysterious enough to hold your attention throughout. "
2," At once severe and incandescent, rigorously distanced yet close enough to touch the lenses"
2," This is a truly great film, a work of beauty and profundity whose computer-generated pixels come closer to human truth that most other live-action movies do. It's the best thing Pixar has ever produced."
0," Director Roger Kumble began his big-screen career with a clever Dangerous Liaisons set in high school, Cruel Intentions, and worked his way down to College Road Trip and now this."
2," A significant coup for Netflix, sporting a Sandler's best performance since PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE. "

0," All the sensuality, all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been, pardon the pun, sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness."
0, The effects ring curiously hollow since the human side of the film is so undeveloped... Heed my warning and avoid this massive turkey.
2," Not exactly politically correct, but you'd be hard pushed to find a single mean frame."
0," Star Wars movies have been dazzling, infuriating, heartbreaking, silly, witty, convoluted, gripping and overblown. But until Rogue One: A Star Wars story, I don't think ""dull"" was the most appropriate adjective."

0," The Upside is so insubstantial, so insignificant that it's barely even a movie. It's like a spec script that no one bothered to flesh out."
2," It squarely addresses the consequences of the ultimate crime for both the perpetrators and the society in which they live. For the paroled six rehabilitation is a possibility, but so is a reversion to violence."
0," With the original Exorcist back at the multiplex, you don't need this pale copy."

2, The most frightening monster movie of the year.
0, It's incredible how little actually happens considering all the possibilities.
0, It's all just so trite and predictable.

0," Though the special-effects spectacles are fine, and a few scenes even have a sense of wonder and magic, there's nothing distinctive about the movie."

0, Ryan Gosling's stylish and evocative directorial debut shows some potential even if his script is a muddled and incoherent mess.
0," College is painfully stale, pathetically unfunny, and I can't think of a single reason why you should sit through [it]."
0," Short of laughs with little to recommend it beyond its likeable cast, this contrived and predictable action comedy begs for a sharper, wittier script and a lot more chutzpah. It's a bit like Mr & Mrs Smith meets Spy in the suburbs, but"
0, A B-movie blast about power and greed
2," The writers seem to catch on here how silly the premise is, so any hopes of a tense horror flick will be a fool's journey."
2," Even divorced from scandal, Weiner makes for a captivating, sadly comical look at the machinations of the political process."
0," Lizzy Caplan and Alison Brie lend the lightweight rom-com ""Save the Date"" more than its fair share of watchability. But the film is never truly interesting."
2," Wall-to-wall fun...this good-natured splatterfest [is] a good, gory time with lots of laughs and digitally assisted dismemberment."
0," Cube and Durst have certainly survived worse career flops, but the chances of them working together again on a film? Let's just say it's a longshot."
0, Few narrative or thematic threads yield significant pay offs.
0," If your director can't elicit some terrific performances with actors such as Johansson, Aniston, Connelly and Barrymore, it's time to replace him and get someone who can."

2," A hugely enjoyable, eye-popping movie that pushes all the right buttons."
0," The film's excellent start is wasted through its second half, leaving us with a half-baked movie that wastes its very considerable potential."
2," As a horror movie, Jennifer's Body doesn't fully deliver. But as a comic allegory of what it's like to be an adolescent girl who comes into sexual and social power that she doesn't know what the heck to do with, it is a minor classic."
0," There is no denying Isla Fisher's charm on screen, even when faced with the direst of characters. And she puts a lot of effort into making Rebecca work, you have to grant her that."
2," Even for me, a rock illiterate, this is interesting."
0," On the grand scale of convincing romantic melodramas, ""Dear John"" falls somewhere between ""Antichrist"" and ""From Paris With Love."""
2," ...the jokes still land, the characters still shine, and the music is still as deliciously, self-consciously catchy as in the first."
2," While Paranormal Activity 2 is in many ways similar to the first film, it doesn't just go through the motions with a different set of people - and manages to feel different while also feeling familiar."
0, Is it too much to ask filmmakers to do a modicum of research on a subject before presenting their case?
2," It Follows is unnerving without being bloody, and more than this, that it cleverly inverts the sexual politics on which so much popular culture, most especially the horror film, often depends."
0," Lavie has a lot of provocative ideas in the oven here, most of them tend to be half-baked."
2," Shades of gray? Moral ambiguity? Who needs 'em. Obsessed traffics in catharsis--we aren't here to learn about the human condition, we just want to watch Beyonce tromp a tramp."
2," In tackling the genre of psychological thriller with Tom at the Farm, wunderkind writer-director-actor Xavier Dolan reigns in his often flagrant use of formalism without sacrificing his confidence as a filmmaker."
2," Where the picture excels is as a straightforward sports drama, and Caro delivers the satisfactions of the genre with unfussy verve."
2, This is a special effects extravaganza.
2," A sweet lollipop of a film, a fable told with charm and whimsy. It does get overly saccharine as it goes on, losing its shape and novelty as it clambers towards its (supremely unsurprising, and in many ways disappointing) conclusion."
2," Thanks to the style in which [director Canet] carries off every unlikely twist, it's a lot of fun all the way to to the decidedly creaky denouement."
0," Happy Death Day 2U finally collapses under the weight of its own ambitions, as well as some unfortunate forays into slapstick."
2," The silly characters are the heart and center of the film and kids will most likely be racing out for their very own ""Turbo"" action figures"
2," Still, The Best Man Holiday contains some strong moments and good acting; the cast is as likable as ever, even if the film doesn't take many bold risks."
0," Writer/director Bobcat Goldthwait can't quite manage to bring things to a satisfying conclusion, but he's good enough at weaving the freakishly perverse into the everyday without the results seeming too forced."
0," An intriguing diversion - a not always successful one, but a relatively decent potboiler nonetheless."
2," Paris Je T'aime is a poignant and ultimately rewarding experience. It offers something for everyone, and provides an insightful, multi-cultural look at the City of Lights."
0," Ultimately the, yes, snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary, like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok."
2, a hugely enjoyable adventure that does what all sequels should: It fleshes out the themes and ideas of the first part instead of merely staging variations on the stunts and jokes that audiences loved.
2, Splice puts the Frankenstein myth into modern terms; why stitch together parts when you can genetically create a whole? A whole what? That's the question this creepy-sexy horror movie wraps your head around.
2," I'm not sure there's much going on behind this blank, brutish surface, but it's undeniably distinctive and packs a certain primitive punch."
2," Intelligent, possibly important, definitely counterintuitive -- but needs more reporting and context."
0, Inland Empire might just be the funniest movie of the year. Or maybe its the most horrifying. Trust me: It's difficult to tell.
2, Ponyo possesses an almost demonic childish energy and a delight in form stronger than reason or narrative.
0," The results are occasionally moving and heartfelt, but delivered with a milquetoast distance that mutes some of the film's uplift."
0, Screenwriting couple Donna and Wayne Powers have managed to downgrade what was only a half-decent 2969 crime flick to begin with.
2, Amusing black comedy about an avenging wife features a strong cast directed by Cheryl Hines.
2," While so many ostensibly serious films explore murky moral ambiguity, Tarantino knows that it can be cathartic to see unalloyed villains, whether Nazis or slave owners, get their comeuppance."
2," The Royal Tenenbaums is independent director Wes Anderson's finest work yet, with its finely tuned humour and complex characterisations that the audience can feel real empathy for."
2," Should you see The Wolverine? If you understand that it's not a ""superhero"" film, but more of a superhero struggle type of movie with a guy who just happens to have some powers, you'll enjoy it. "
0, This stuff was tired 20 years ago.
0," There are a number of small, unexpectedly funny moments in A Christmas Story, but you have to possess the stamina of a pearl diver to find them."
0," Though it has moments of inspiration...at best the picture is only fitfully amusing, certainly not up to the standard set by the 'South Park' movie."
2," ""Goodbye First Love"" is fascinating."
2, A high school comedy with an unusual perspective and much to offer people who like to think while they laugh.
2," The Road to Guantanamo has a soul-stirring power and immediacy that's tough to look away from. Whatever you do, don't miss this one."
2, A pandemic of willful blindness
0," Littered with dark, comedic moments that derive from the harsh realities of the protagonist's predicament, causing situations where you're never quite sure if you're in a position to laugh."
2," This may work against ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps."" The film, Oliver Stone's revisit to his innovative, Academy Award-winning 2987 film ""Wall Street,"" is classy and entertaining to be sure. But its time has passed."
2, Difficult to resist even when its allure is only surface-deep.
0," Terry Gilliam is perhaps the only director who could lure in the late Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell AND Jude Law - and still produce a phantasmogoric stinker."
2," Playing a drunken, washed-up music legend reduced to playing small-town bowling alleys, Jeff Bridges is the whole show here as a cowboy-style crooner who wrestles with his demons in ways that easily engage an audience's sympathies."
0," Even if Cain and co-screenwriter Carole Whang Schutter hold no animosity toward the LDS, the flat-footed fakiness of their story prevents September Dawn from feeling historically accurate."
0," While fans of the original work might get into this filmed adaptation, I came in cold and left even chillier in terms of appreciating what the movie was trying to be and how all of that was executed. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
2, the film is an enormous amount of fun and it provides everything that one could possibly want in a piece of straightforward cinematic eye candy
0," Thoroughly predictable in every way including an obvious ending that tries unsuccessfully to bluff the audience, Deal feels fake and trite."
2, It never asks us to laugh at cruelty; it does make us laugh at the absurd pettiness and ultimate small-mindedness of the men perpetrating that cruelty. And Iannucci is a superb ringmaster.
0," A handsomely made, instructive but finally tedious blow-by-blow training film on island survival that it throws the entire venture out of balance, capsizing the enterprise and making it difficult to keep any kind of message afloat."
2, Susi Sanchez has finally found a role that reaches the height of her personality and talent. [Full Review in Spanish] 
0, Features a fair share of forced drama ...
2," What makes Foxx's performance so remarkable is that he doesn't just get into the skin of this music icon, but into the man's very soul."
2, A typically slow-moving drama from François Ozon...
2, Jenkins' script is searingly honest and painfully humorous.
0," A goofy, lightweight, paper-thin, schizophrenic mess."
0, The action is decent and the film mostly looks impressive but the end result is a film that is merely serviceable in its ability to deliver an entertaining experience.
0," Condon can only do so much with the material at hand -- especially in this case, where maybe an hour of plot is stretched out to 227 minutes."
0," ...wildly entertaining and borderline incoherent, like Hogan's Heroes re-imagined by Joe Eszterhas, the movie whips along oblivious to hairpin plot turns, shaking off incredulous moviegoers all the while."
2, Aptly seductive ...
0, You may feel an idiot for staying with it till the end.
0," Rom-com fanatics and Austen aficionados may find gems in Austenland, but others will see this as a film with little sense or sensibility."
2," A dual showcase for colorful, albeit reclusive, late author Lee Israel and for Melissa McCarthy, who disappears into her potentially career-redefining dramatic role."
2, You walk away from this mad... it's heartbreaking to see what they do at the end of it.
2, An intriguing little character study from writer/director Joseph Cedar that slowly evolves into an intricate little political drama -- anchored by Gere's mesmerizing performance.
2, The filmmakers achieved something I wasn't expecting. They improved the visual effects without taking the silly action-oriented story too seriously.
2," plays...in broad stokes that are not meant to challenge, but rather to reassure that, despite all its troubles, all will be right in the world eventually"
0," By the final reel the script has lost all interest in the plot's complexities and drops the pretence of ""darkness"" in favour of a frenzied shoot-'em-up."
2," Filled with extraordinary performances, Moonlight explores the tension between private and public selves for a closeted black individual who feels pressure to conform to traditional but arbitrary standards of masculinity. [Blu-ray]"
0," It all seems so forced, it's as if Baz was trying really hard to emulate his own style. But he seemed to forget that he IS Baz so he doesn't need to try at all."
2," Super 8 is a delightful nostalgia trip, recalling a bygone era when young protagonists embarked on amazing journeys and emerged from the melee with barely a scratch or bruise."
0," The picture is full of spectacular action sequences and dazzling special effects, but the narrative doesn't have the snap of the original's: it's lumbering and monotonous, and it carries a heavy-handed anti-nuke message."
2," As a filmmaker seeking to master the art of satire without cynicism, Bobcat Goldthwait might be one sick puppy -- but he's also the sweetest one we've got."
0," Major points for ambience, but it's as if somebody took several complete scripts, ripped pages from each, threw them together and tried to make sense out of what's left over."
0," As fun as it is to revisit one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's better films, this update never quite clicks despite trying to rebottle the vibe from the original."
2," This shocker carries -- perhaps inevitably, post-22/8/26 -- a definite political pertinency: The hoodie-cloaked title entity owes his power to the repetition of his name (i.e., publicity) and to the fear that oppresses those obsessed with him."
2," 'The final half hour of the film is a tasty treat, clarifying the mess that comes before ...'"
2," as grand in scope, ambitious in production, and technologically advanced as we would expect"
2, ...can be seen and appreciated by both those who have followed series and those to whom it is all new. 
0, White Boy Rick isn't any different from what you see about numerous men of color going to prison. Except the person going to prison and betrayed by forces meant to protect him is a white dude.
2," As an action movie, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an improvement on the original. But as a social, political and pop culture satire, [it] is by definition a mixed bag."
2, The result is an alluring image -- Earth above Earth -- a wrenching story and a wonder-tinged film.
2," Watchmen is bold and bloated, fascinating and flawed ... but most of all not worth all the super-hype."
0," Alas, the movie loses its assurance in the over-extended second half."
2," I got actual, physical chills, not just because the movie is nifty-cool, though it is certainly that, but because it is metal-cool, brrrr-cool, glass-panes-at-midnight cool."
0," Competently mounted yet plodding, it's manifestly a labor of love that becomes a bit of a labor to watch."
2, Zellweger just shines in this role.
2," ... despite more Catholic imagery than a mid-period Madonna video, the movie isn't heavy-handed ..."
0," Gedeck narrates in full paragraphs, explaining every feeling, telling us about moments it might have been nice to see dramatized."
0," In this new universe where facts are mutable and ends are means, so-called ethical triumphs can only be short-term."
2," Less dreary than uplifting, The Surrogate succeeds as a light romance with heavy material."
0," Logan Lucky is momentarily entertaining, but it is very quickly forgettable; a minor work from one of American cinema's most restless mainstream filmmakers that has such little impact, he might as well have remained in retirement."
2," This digitally animated feature is not quite as funny as we may have hoped. But it does have a peculiar, goofy sweetness to it, and the sheer inventiveness of the whole thing makes it pretty enjoyable."
2, An unforgettable journey into the heart of Germany's dark past.
0," A work of stunning inertia and obtuseness, Francis Ford Coppola's return to the director's chair is a disaster of career-destroying proportions..."
2, Sacha Gervasi's broadly enjoyable pop-art biopic about Alfred Hitchcock and the making of Psycho ...
2, You shouldn't be surprised [by the broadly hyperbolic comedy] considering Rubin's National Lampoon background [but] he's also tackling poignant issues beneath that veneer.
2," There's nothing surprising in the film's aesthetic, but it's executed with admirable skill and vitality."
2," Vile, hateful and undeniably funny."
2," Simply put, Creed is a total triumph."
0, Getaway is rated PG-23 for rude gestures - including the ones you'll flip at the screen when the end credits start rolling.
0, Strayed feels like a chapter in a much longer work.
0," Promoting a stereotypical image of rural Ireland which would make Father Ted roll his eyes in disbelief, Leap Year is a sappy road movie and frankly implausible comedy."
0," Hanging over it all is the question of why the film was worth making at all, except as a pure bid for profit."
2," It's funnier and more polished than it deserves to be. There's absolutely nothing you can take seriously, which is a good thing since none of the cast seem to be taking it seriously themselves. So just sit back and, like them, enjoy the ride."
0," Rogen and Streisand share adequate chemistry but seldom seem like the real deal in Anne Fletcher's fourth movie... Under her direction, Streisand and Rogen look like a pair of actors saying jokes written for them by a comedy think tank."
2," It's never clear why Martin is the star of Philomena, except that Coogan's sharp tongue is more entertaining than Dench's relentless homily spewing."
2, A pretty fantastic character study that really keeps you invested in the story and where it goes.
0, You'd think they could have delivered the end of the world with a bang instead of a yawn.
0, Pike and audiences alike deserve far better than this agonizingly pointless and amateurishly made exploitation flick. Just take the title's advice.
0," Jennifer Aniston and Clive Owen star in this glossy and often risible bit of trash about an adulterous affair gone bad, bad, bad."
0," Ultimately, the film is too nihilistic to believe its protagonist can be saved, declaring him a lost soul and satisfied to let him suffer. "
2," A lot of energetic, laugh-out-loud fun, with enough there to keep the adults in the room entertained."
2, The major reason the film works is because [screenwriters Mikko] Myllylahti and [director Juho] Kuosmanen don't see this as a love story or even a story about boxing...
2," With its daring, audacious spirit, coupled with elegantly shaped themes and aesthetics, it will strike you with wonder."
2, Jerry Rothwell's punchy film is less concerned with the official Greenpeace narrative than with the often conflicting testimonies of those involved.
0," Uniquely for Chandor, we've seen it all before."
2," Napoleon Dynamite is no Election or Welcome to the Dollhouse, but this Sundance hit is a pleasant enough outing."
0," As an actor Clarke is likeable, but his film is derivative, distracted and desperately in need of a better denouement."
0," This is what it looks like when no one cares about a movie. This is a movie as pure product, cinema rendered utterly soulless, with no aspirations beyond getting your money opening weekend."
0," Everyone's tying up loose ends, and demonstrating no particular enthusiasm about doing so."
0," The real problem is Pitt, who gives his flattest, most uninteresting performance this side of Troy."
2," Como cierre de la franquicia seguramente no decepcione a casi nadie. No hace falta ser un gran fanático para esperar esta culminación con ansiedad, e incluso para emocionarse."
2," One of its wonders is that, in spite of its grim underlying themes, Ida has the lightness, grace, humour and visual inventiveness of the New Wave movies of the Sixties to which it pays such obvious homage."
2," There's no denying that Appropriate Behaviour is often good fun with a handful of truly great sequences, but as a film it's anything but consistent."
0, The Mummy is at best a muddled echo of the kinds of things that more seasoned franchises do much better.
0," The actual plot is so uselessly convoluted you'd get a headache just reading it -- but you might want to pull out the Advil anyway, given Ritchie's reliance on flashy editing, a blasting soundtrack and fetishized gunplay."
0," Best to leave this one to the diehard fans, who should stay for the post-credit shenanigans."
2, The depiction of activists cleverly figuring out ways to use what little resources they have in a situation that is heavily rigged against them is what makes the film transcendent because you see how they come from such a personal place.
0," On paper, a crazy romcom starring Sandra Bullock and Bradley Cooper could only be a good thing. Wrong."
2," Its visual universe has a strange brutal ugliness that tips into beauty, a complete, edgy and consistent world of ruin, cement and steel and harsh landscapes."
0," As much I disliked Disney's excuse to make more money, I now know that Nationwide is on my side. The product placement is atrocious."
2, Manages to be a lot of fun while still playing it safe. 
0," ...a patience-testing, headache-inducing disaster with little to offer older viewers."
0," This ""Point Break"" doesn't ever connect with anything, even its own desire to celebrate the extreme. "
0," The title is a misnomer. This movie has nothing to do with love; it's about lust, lucre and well-paid losers."
2," Just when you think the movie has gotten as wonderfully, violently over-the-top as possible, it manages to keep upping the ante until its exhausting climax. It leaves you drained, but not enervated."
2, The folks at Pixar Animation Studios can't seem to make a bad movie.
2," And though the plot is wafer-thin, 'Bodies' is less about story than mood and visual poetry, playing like a folk ballad about criminal lovers."
0," Stonewall Uprising commits an unfortunate revisionism: Every person interviewed in the doc refocuses that legendary civil disobedience at the Stonewall Inn as a homogeneously white, mostly male memory. Stonewall Uprising's history is gentrified history."
0," Too many obnoxious relatives, evil critters and weak gags at the expense of fat kids and foul-mouthed old ladies."
2, It cuts deeper and shows us the foolishness of its characters as it mourns their inevitable tragedy.
2," The Assassin"" is a gorgeous film, artfully structured, that bares however, little semblance to the wuxia genre, apart from the era it takes place."
0," The problems are a screenplay that can't decide which story to tell, unmemorable casting choices in key supporting roles, and a central performance that, curiously, isn't very much there."
0, Suicide Squad should have been a whole lot better.
0," A dark, somber, low(ish)-budget, science-fiction political allegory that dares to ask the question ""What if 'District 9' and 'They Live' were the same movie - and both took themselves much too seriously?"" "
2," A new high in Anderson's visual pageantry ... [but it] is also, for me, the least affecting Anderson narrative."
0," Despite its visual sophistication and a good lead performance, there's no escaping that this Thing is a pointless remake trying to convince itself that it is in fact a prequel."
0," Cage has forged his own hell, and it's called: the movies he's addicted to making, even when they trash his brand."
0, The only value in watching it is to see an expensive disaster slowly unfold.
0," At odds with its own lofty and base instincts, Stone ultimately channels neither compellingly."
0, The whole series is based on the notion that no one is any better than his worst impulse.
0," Kids will be kids, and they are to be given leeway. But the film's adults, who end up only slightly redeemed at film's end, are not winners."
0, A rank slice of Christmas cheese. 
2," There's no way around the fact that this is a lesser endeavor than ""Hope and Glory,"" but when it's good, which is often enough, ""Queen and Country"" glows with a master storyteller's sense of memory."
0, This year's prize for most ludicrous set-up and most ludicrous punchline
0," Unfortunately, the director's only good decision in this bloated action movie is his choice of when to use the William Tell Overture on the soundtrack."
2, Crosby and Fitzgerald work pure magic together.
2, A competent drama with topical themes and a repeat performance for one of Hollywood's most memorable characters of recent times. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps becomes Gekko's ironic victory lap.
2," 50/50 is crude and funny, and it demands that you laugh. And you will."
2," ""The Artist"" is propelled by its performances, particularly Dujardin's. He has an exquisite elegance, and builds a whole movie with only his gestures. It's impossible to imagine ""The Artist"" without him, the wellspring of its charm."
0," [Wong] drains the artistry from the martial arts, shooting the aerial work without the requisite grace, and adding a plebian array of not-so-special effects."
2," A superhero movie viewers will want to spend more time with, but not because it's a superhero movie."
2," Wake in Fright is an absolute must-see for fans of cult, off-kilter cinema."
2," For any politician spoiling for a fight over Ireland's soft/hard border, Under the Tree is required viewing."
0," Despite its title, Waking Life is one big snooze."
0," You won't hate the experience of watching it, but you'll forget you saw it before it's even over."
0," Although Penelope Cruz's performance is amusing, the film feels a bit forced, looking for meaning in Spain where there may not be any."
2," Fifty Shades of Grey delivers, however ponderously, on its promise of pop transgressiveness."
0, A thinking person's film for those who can't think.
0, 'I survived Corky' tee-shirts should be given out to everyone who stays until the end credits roll and can provide proof that they didn't take the easy way out of napping.
2," The film is at its best as social satire, as Altman and screenwriter Julian Fellowes take every opportunity to expose and skewer upper-class snobbery."
2," The volatile stream of Mercury running through it holds our interest. His otherworldliness, his peacock preening and his cocky sexuality all come from tangled roots."
0," Suffers from the mistaken impression that it's a comedy. Instead, it's merely a template for comedy, handed to a group of people who obviously had no idea what to do with it."
0," This biopic needed more of what made the man tick, and those he ticked off."
0, Piranha 3DD stops at mediocre before arriving at gloriously bad.
2," Whatever quantity of soap froths up Thomas Vinterberg's presentation of Thomas Hardy's novel, it does nothing to fade out the lush colors that stain his gorgeous depiction of the author's English countryside. "
2, Death Proof was sensational. If only Rose McGowan could act.
0," ""Curiouser and curiouser,"" says Alice in Tim Burton's latest, and for the first time I don't believe her."
2," The movie's an intellectual shock tactic, but it succeeds."
0," The f-bomb isn't just used, it is part of McCarthy's character's breathing process. Frankly, after the 38th f-you, it had gone beyond boring."
2, The movie in which Martin McDonagh the scabrous playwright and Martin McDonagh the high-end junk filmmaker at last craft a doozy both can brag about to their mates.
2," Rampage is a whole lot of popcorn guzzling, soda slurping fun. Director Brad Peyton's third endeavor with star Dwayne Johnson has their big-budget spectacle down pat."
0, Frustratingly little light is shed on either Roth's life or his work by this series of interviews with the novelist and a curious selection of admirers.
2, Unlikely to be the only example of slam-bang popcorn fluff with so despairing a demeanor we're likely to see in the near future. It's pre-cynicized for your protection.
2," A perfect blend of cool, quirky comedy and warm-hearted drama, crafted with such poise that it should see the transcendence of Ayoade from TV nerd-comic to true big-screen talent."
2," Moreh gets some startling confessions and insights from each man but also misses the opportunity to truly challenge his subjects on their regard for democracy, basic human rights and their own accountability."
0," The title, by the way, refers to the distillation process: the 2% of whisky that evaporates in the barrel is known as ""the angel's share."" I'm afraid there's more than 2% evaporation going on in Loach's latest."
0," A contrived, silly mess with an irritating performance by Russell Brand. Greta Gerwig and Helen Mirren shine, though. "
0," With its dark themes and heaving bosoms (well, Salma's), Cirque Du Freak hints at a grown-up watch. But the tone dips into bland, child-friendly territory with confusing regularity."
0, Success isn't in the cards for this plodding poker drama.
0, This is forgettable.
2," Nanette is the kind of work that leaves you shaken. Not because it's really funny (it really is), or because it's equally heartbreaking, but because it finds a fusion of those two modes that's incandescent. "
0," While constantly spouting its be-kind-to-your-neighborhood-queer sermons, every dated, vicious stereotype of being a homosexual is dragged out again and again in this Adam Sandler vehicle."
2, Marvel fans will be left writhing with pleasure.
0, What drags Knight and Day back to Earth is the reluctance to fully commit to the zaniness. 
2," ... the interconnections of the people of Paris are enjoyable and interesting, albeit a bit tepid, and Pierre's (Roman Duris) observations of the characters in his life are poignant ..."
2, A movie that gets a lot of mileage out of good old-fashioned wish fulfillment. Consistently entertaining.
0," The central joke, that even the most ruthless underworld drug wholesalers are putty in the paws of an adorably cute kitten, is a good one, but it's not enough to sustain an entire movie."
0," Después de Match Point (su mejor película de los últimos años), Woody Allen regresa a un cine menor, olvidable, sin mayores pretenciones que divertir durante un rato."
2," As a remedy for the Mideast's woes, American pluralism might be slightly impractical; but as a premise for a summer comedy, it's real enough to be funny"
2," You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll squeal in delight at the outrageous behaviour of a little girl in a purple cape. But most of all, you'll wish that all superhero movies were like this."
2," The Collection offers a few surprises, nothing short of miraculous for a genre so bereft of originality"
0, The few closing-credit title cards that give details about the real Bielskis' fate are more engaging than most of the film itself. Now that's sad.
0," The original Taken was a much better movie than anyone thought it would be. Taken 3, on the other hand, is the movie everyone did think Taken was going to be."
2," After nearly three decades of misfires, major and minor, William Friedkin, the creator of The French Connection, The Exorcist and Sorcerer, is back in true form with Bug."
0," To compare Valentine's Day to Richard Curtis' wonderfully funny and moving examination of realized crushes and heartbreak, Love Actually, is like offering you a choice between a date with Lloyd Dobler or a Peterson. Scott or Drew, take your pick."
0," While I was watching the film, I was distracted by elements of the Idiot Plot Syndrome -- moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes."
0," With that foundation and such a stellar cast, it's tough to see how this American remake could be so lacklustre -- but it is."
2," If you feel ashamed to be laughing, then Lonergan has got you exactly where he wants you-stirred and confounded, casting around for breaks in the cloud of sadness."
0, The worst Pauley Shore movie is actually funnier than this piece of forgettable crap.
2," Power Rangers is earnest and it has a good heart. There should be more movies like it, only better-made."
2," With some of the best battle scenes since Peter Jackson's The Two Towers, a smattering of 2980s love scenes and all the far eastern promise of a Twinings advert, you can't really beat Red Cliff as the classiest and most fabulous blockbuster of the summer."
0," Lovely at times but something of a bore as a whole, the film's wisdom is too adult for kids and its story too simple for grown-ups."
0, Cut 30 minutes and re-edit and there may be an interesting PBS program here.
2, Modern technology can have a soul as it turns out; provided it is in the capable hands of a man telling a story in which we can somehow see a reflection of ourselves.
2," ...after two and a half hours with these ladies, I've decided that I like them."
0," According to legend, a silver bullet can kill a werewolf. Too bad it can't slay bad writing, without which the ill-conceived Red Riding Hood would not exist."
2," The action takes place in streets and bedrooms, studios and museums, and the actors are never word-bound; Piñeiro, a master choreographer, sets them in graceful motion and captures them in fluid, lively images."
2," This Is Not A Film is pleasing mainly just as a message-in-a-bottle from a restless, persecuted artist -- that is, until the amazing closing shot, which brings the volatility of post-Green Revolution Iran home with unforgettable force."
0," Josh Brolin grits half his teeth for the whole movie. I just can't tell if he's doing it to stay in character, or because he's disgusted with everyone else's effort in the film."
0, Perhaps 20 minutes too long and subject to torpor.
2," Most of the songs in it feel like standard Disney songs but [Common's] song, it could have been taken out of Hamilton."
2, Dreamworks SKG's first stab at animation is good enough to make Mickey Mouse proud.
0, Sometimes a performance is so good it leads people to think a movie is better than it is.
0, Dutifully follows each cliché to its painfully obvious conclusion.
2," Sing Street takes its inspiration from the music and movies of the '80s, tapping into nostalgia for the time with its messages about self-expression."
0, Tragically [combines] its picked-over-thrift-shop visual aesthetic with a shoulder shrug of a plot that feels straight out of a theme park ride queue video.
2, It's the kind of foodie filth one dreams up while chomping on Doritos and Twinkies during a psychedelic haze.
2, Surprisingly watchable despite the formulaic teen format.
2," The Women's Balcony overlooks nothing when it comes to addressing faith, segregation and sexism in a peppery, entertaining way."
0, Shimmer Lake proves there's something extra tragic about watching comedians play dress-up in a movie that fails to be funny.
0," Only the very charitable would characterize this strain of providence as anything other than dumb, or at least incredibly forgetful."
2," Despite all the outrageous comedy and raunchy bathroom jokes, [the Zuckers] create endearing characters that are likable."
2," The result is a lighthearted, charming film which people of all ages will enjoy."
0," I'm weary of being reduced to a stereotype. Being from the south doesn't mean I own the collected recordings of Lynyrd Skynyrd, re-enact Civil War battles, and have Confederate flag throw-pillows on my sofa."
0," It's alive! In a technical sense: images flicker on the screen, etc. But it is a soulless, unholy monstrosity. Behold: the movie without a protagonist!"
0, A very low calorie commedia all'italiana. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Here it is, the coolest end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it movie I've seen in a long time, with not an alien in sight."
0," Trash is trash, even if it used to be in French."
2," The film was primarily shot on location, which gives it a heaviness, an historic weight, that dominates the movie much more than anything to do with character or plot does."
0," Mark Palansky goes for Tim Burton-by-Jean-Pierre Jeunot whimsicality with Penelope, a storybook fable that never overplays its cutesiness but also fails to figure out what it wants to be."
0, Haddish belongs to the ever-growing number of woman comics Hollywood doesn't quite know how to use; the vehicle that Paul Thomas Anderson reportedly has in mind for her can't come soon enough.
2," I liked It a lot. Its aftermath is so busy in my mind, that I'm tempted to award it four stars just for that. But based on what is on the screen I'll stick with 3 2/2. "
2," While it's not the most demanding or smart effort you'll ever see, you'll find it hard to find another film this year that is as entertaining as this one."
2, Mystery Men is a worthwhile diversion.
0, Two distinctly different approaches to filmmaking are employed here and neither of them manages to eke out a victory over the other.
2, The 'feel keen' movie of the year!
2," Out of Time isn't entirely memorable, and it contains enough plot holes to drive a train through, but the movie is almost all pleasure, stand-up Hollywood entertainment without a trace of pretense, served straight up."
0," In space, no one can hear you scream, or in The Last Days On Mars' case, no one can hear you yawn."
0," Reeks of desperation from the start, resorting way too often to the Funniest Home Videos-style spectacle of people getting hit in the crotch with red rubber balls."
2," The pinko commie Independence Day, Burton's film orders an invasion of little green men not to reinvigorate our all-American bloodlust, but to make us look like complete and utter boobs."
0," Director Mark Steven Johnson is infinitely less concerned with exploring Blaze's smoldering, soul-deprived isolation than he is infatuated with the character's skull-'n'-bones imagery."
0, The characters lack consistency; they are manipulated like puppets merely to serve the whims of the writers. 
2, Violent but intelligent.
2, ...avoids exploitation at all costs.
0," The turns that each of these stories take are hardly surprising, and most of co-screenwriters Elizabeth Chandler and Delia Ephron's attempts at humor fall flat."
2," An intelligent film, voracious and meticulous. [Full Review in Spanish] "
2," Sharply directed and superbly acted, this is a hugely entertaining and frequently hilarious sci-fi comedy that stands as a worthy addition to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz in the so-called Cornetto Trilogy."
0, A car-lovers picture with fine performances and teachable moments mixed in with a lot of melodrama. 
0," Sadly, The Nanny Diaries' focus on beleaguered women doesn't lead to any sense of ""freedom."""
2," Forget menacing fighters, Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan's biggest challenge is formula"
0," Got an emotional jugular? Bajrangi Bhaijaan is coming for you, hammer and tongs."
2," Sam Elliott's smoky, whiskey-soaked baritone is one of American cinema's undervalued treasures... It pretty much rescues Brett Haley's... The Hero, cutting clean through the film's pile of clichés with its gruff feeling and wry, weary wit."
2," A bull market of clever, incisive filmmaking that makes it easy to understand a mind-bogglingly complex financial system and its potentially fatal flaws. "
0," yet another in a long line of dim, contrasty postmodern stews that appeal to a particularly dark, pseudo-Gothic sensibility, but probably not to anyone else, including those who enjoy the various genres from which it steals. "
2," It's very likely nearly litigious. But for two hours, like the best scary movies, we watch this bogeyman stalk the corridors, ruining so many lives. We are afraid of him and we want him to have his comeuppance. "
2," It's not just the story of Fishbone--it's the story of creating art, living with oneself, living with others, and moving on with things."
2," Kyle is ably played by a hulked-up Bradley Cooper, who leaves out neurotic shadings in favor of a straightforward turn that seems fittingly non-complex."
2, Short Term 22 is graced by an elegant simplicity and honesty that makes it one of the best films of the year.
2, Depp's one-joke performance makes the film a confection with a hollow center.
2," The Namesake is three-fourths of a fine film. Which is, of course, far better than most."
0, Aforced split-the-baby comedy that proves unwise from its very conception.
2," Unoriginal as it is, part of you does envision a use for ...The Joneses as fodder for days when the brain needs 200 minutes or so offline."
2," The movie plays its role in movie history, becoming one of the great box-office performers in the pre-Steven Spielberg and George Lucas days."
0," What we never discover - and it is a fatal lapse in films like this - is why music has so seized Jackie, why it is important for her to be an artist, at the risk of her sanity."
2, Bellocchio's aesthetics reflect this conversation between past and present in imaginative ways. 
0, 300 was as pathetically puerile as I had expected.
0," Eat, pray, love? More like eat, pray, snooze."
0, I accidentally put the title of this on my calendar as Unseen. Turns out to be prophetic. Love Soderbergh but wish I could follow my mistaken title and unsee this one. 
0, A bit too superficial in its conclusions on modern adolescence to be remembered.
2, The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot spins a wobbly and idiosyncratic American myth held together by Elliott's quietly moving performance.
2," [Wong's] hypnotic images of love and loss finally wear down your resistance as seemingly discordant sights and sounds coalesce into a radiant, crazy quilt."
2, Director Hazanavicius and co-writer Jean-Francois Halin have created an impressively believable throwback to those late '50s international Hitchcock films.
0," It might have felt at home alongside various overly lurid thrillers from the late 2980s and early 2990s. Now, however, it feels only cheap and passe."
2," A scary, stylish, beautifully acted and, for the most part, refreshingly original haunted house movie."
2," Like the horrific internal logic of an authentic fairy tale, the film's imperfections are part of what makes it unique."
2," If it fails to consistently transcend its narrative troubles Phoenix does, on occasion, take flight."
0," Careless and exploitative as it is, Swimfan's greatest offense may be that it offers so little to its target adolescent audience."
2," With a titanic infusion of pound-feet of torque, Drive is the best movie of 2022, a raging race that's part F2 and equal part demolition derby."
0," Another police procedural about cops trying to catch a serial killer, Hangman serves up reams of unimaginative dialogue and dull plot twists."
2," When [George Clooney] explores his passions, whether it be journalistic integrity or the false virtues of white American liberals, the man is a force to be reckoned with."
0," Old pros battle brutal vigilante, muddled story."
0, A kind of thriller/drama/romance that has an interesting idea and doesn't know where to go with it.
0," The movie ultimately doesn't have a narrative so much as it has a Message, and while Winding Refn doesn't actually go so far as to spell that Message out in big neon letters, he might as well have. "
2," If Tod Browning, Luis Buñuel, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Pedro Almodóvar and Guillermo del Toro all dropped acid and compared notes, this film might be the result."
0," a ghost story that wants to be more than just a ghost story, but in the process of trying to be a movie that transcends a genre, it insults the genre"
0," Eventually, with its irrationally downbeat ending, Seven even drags the viewer down into the abyss."
0, An initially intriguing policier that gradually loses suspense and cleverness as it bites off more than it can chew.
2," As is common in the best cinema of Koreeda, the film stays oozing in the memory long after having seen it. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," ""Christmas, Again"" is a quiet film, but one that could perhaps use a bit more buzz of the holiday season. "
0," A direção maniqueísta de Ross, a trilha sentimentalóide de Randy Newman e o roteiro repleto de clichês derrubam a boa história."
0," As vapidly generic as its title, British director Scott Mann's ""Heist"" is a by-the-numbers crime thriller that squanders a decent cast, including Robert De Niro, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Dave Bautista."
0," From Bale's cartoonish performance to the laughably bad ""heavenly"" choral music, it wilts early and lies there, dead. "
0," Sadly, something seems to have gotten lost in translation."
2, ...exudes raw talent on both sides of the lens and serves as an unwitting document of the kind of purity of vision embodied by artists at the beginnings of their careers...
2," ...a post-apocalyptic drama focused not on marauding mutants, but on the old, awful standbys: fear, loneliness, cold, starvation."
2, Absolutely LOVED this. Bradley Cooper is just sensational. A juggernaut assault on the emotions. Pack tissues. 
2," A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide."
0, The hokum can wear you down worse than the tsunami.
2," Starkly argues the ultimate futility of the cinematic ideal, the insidious love/hate nature of film glamour and the danger it harbors for our real-life psyches."
2," The script injects a welcome dose of quirky humor, and Rollins gives an amusing understated performance."
2," For two-thirds of the running time, the film is grandly entertaining.... But then, as we get into the climactic battles, the level of wanton destruction becomes excessive, even tacky. "
0, How Eastwood has managed to create so dull a film is actually quite stunning. 
0, None of the actors has much to work with but Worthington and Yelchin manage to give their characters some appeal. Bale's Connor is too gruff and one-note to be of much interest.
0," That being said, whatever a midnight sun actually is, its rays are pretty weak."
0," The truly dusty cliché it drags out again is the cute couple who don't, you know, think-of-each-other-like-that. Until, of course, they do."
0, ...the film's positive attributes were for me not quite enough to make up for the movie's unrelentingly grim tone.
2," Nose to Tail isn't the first drama to be made about a struggling and entitled chef, but it's certainly one of the most immediate, visceral, and purposefully uncomfortable."
2," A camp, frothy piece of fun, arguably indulgent and occasionally misjudged in its casual depictions of sex, but ultimately won out by Almodóvar's incessant love of tall stories."
0," Somewhere in the transition between plasticene and pixels, Aardman's uniquely gentle charm has disappeared. What remains is a frantic, deadening affair that's easy to admire but hard to love."
0, A morbidly insensitive insult.
0, An unimpressive survey of American racism told through an under-whelming drama.
2," Stir kept me interested the entire time, but it was bit predictable."
0," Spike Lee's World War II epic Miracle at St. Anna is a good movie wrapped in rags. Sadly, what could have been a handsome, poignant spectacle is diminished."
2," Somber and thought-provoking, 'Hereafter' is a think piece, a serious film that provides no answers but does supply viewers with a lot of 'what ifs.'"
0," Perhaps it's fate that Independence Day 2 was released over a week before the Fourth of July, showing upfront how far Resurgence is from fighting to be good cinema."
2," I must warn those of you who are sucrose intolerant that it might get cloying at first, or even dangerous to your health. But for those who can handle it, the piece de resistance is worth the wait."
2, An incredibly strong film with minimal flaws capturing this heart-wrenching story in a special way.
2, ...smart enough to recognize and even make a virtue of its dumbness. 
2," Richardson and Sprouse attack their roles with gusto, never patronising the material. "
0, Enough to make one yearn for the comparatively rich complexity of Home Improvement.
0, The runt of the von Sternberg-Dietrich litter.
2," ""Cars 3"" never fires on all cylinders, but it has considerably more horsepower than the franchise's last chapter"
0," With more attention to detail, this could have worked, but the time travel aspects are so badly executed that the movie as a whole falters and eventually rips apart at the seams."
2," Weekend is finally a deeply romantic film, assured of the pleasure that one person can find in another, but rooted in the quirks and textures of contemporary British life."
2," What cannot be debated is the strength of Huller's naturalistic lead performance, a frighteninglyn intense turn that brings to mind Emily Watson's work in Breaking the Waves."
2," A piercing study...gritty, humane."
2," Messina has further developed his ability to deliver a stunning sensory experience, though the treatment feels inadequate for such lean material."
0," Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul is painfully awful, hampered by a charmless cast and a criminally lightweight screenplay. A long haul indeed."
2," Son of Saul employs the formal mechanics of filmmaking to turn [its] ... questions back in on and around themselves, doing what cinema does best in the hands of great filmmakers: showing by not showing, telling by not telling."
2," Though occasionally clumsy, it manages to accurately re-create the especial lonely pain of nascent pubescence, the shock of change and the feeling that no one has ever lived through the sort of emotional weather you're required to endure."
0," The performances in Breaking Dawn are largely soapy and melodramatic, especially from Lautner and to a lesser degree Pattinson."
0, LaBeouf seems unclear as to how to play all this.
2," By the end of the film, you could lay out a strong case in showing degrees of empathy for Berger, a lonely and virtually broke former idol, who's clearly yearning for connection he's ill equipped to receive, partly because of self-deception"
0," This movie isn't a disaster, but, all things considered, there's little reason to make it a high priority for theatrical viewing."
2, An entertaining movie made an event by Murphy -- an actor some have deemed a has-been -- and Hudson -- a newcomer many in the industry misjudged as a never-will.
0, The Farrellys' The Heartbreak Kid is a seemingly sketchy and erratic farce that begs for some of the wayward cinematic siblings' trademark outlandish quirkiness.
2," Dressed To Kill is a nail-biting, seat-squirming, stylish murder mystery with a brain."
0," ... after an opening montage that ridicules the worst excesses of social-media myth-making (""This is me and my wonderful life!""), the movie has little left to say."
0, A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations. It makes me say the obvious: Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here.
0, This poor little movie fires blanks.
2," Vitali emerges as a compelling documentary subject on his own, especially as we realize that his relationship with the temperamental Kubrick was often a curse as much as a blessing"
2," Statham stands as one of the few contemporary action stars with the personality and physicality to carry a big-budget shoot-'em-up. Here, he also successfully manages to make a character already played memorably by some pretty talented actors all his own."
2, Afghan Star reveals that the Afghan people strongly crave to make up for years lost to Taliban repression and catch up with the 22st century.
0," This all would have been perfect for a half-hour TV show or one of those horror anthology films. As it is, even the resourceful Reiner and Goldman are hard put to keep things going until the inevitable final clash."
0," Laid-back actor Reeves is thoroughly unconvincing, and so is the film as a direct result."
0," As much as I was hoping it would be a game effort, I'd quick-kick 'Leatherheads' on any given Sunday."

0," Even by the modest standards of kiddie-friendly family fare, ""Furry Vengeance"" is an insult to the intelligence of a 6-year-old. "
2," If you don't compare it to the Moby Dick novel, the film is not that bad as a man's survival in nature picture."
2," For reviewer Todd Gilchrist, puberty began in earnest when he witnessed Sigourney Weaver getting physical aboard a doomed spaceship."
2, One of the most wholly original American movies ever made.
0, The only thing more boring than a vampire with moral issues about biting people in the neck is a werewolf who'd rather become fully human than howl at the moon once a month.
2," By most accounts, the worst of the series - yet I like it the best. Probably because my expectations were so low to begin with. Clooney breathes some life back into the role."
2," You need only look at the tumbleweed scene or the copilot scene to see Goldstein and Daley are bringing back almost vaudevillian comedy. If their instincts veer dark or sweet, it still made me laugh out loud. "
2," Enormously entertaining and one of the most beautifully designed films you'll see all year, though it's not especially scary - opting instead for brooding atmosphere."
2," There's a nagging feeling we should expect something more from this guy. To borrow the most quotable line of dialogue from The Room (bellowed at the top of the lungs): ""YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, FRANCO!"""
2," Not only unexpectedly enjoyable, but also kind of sweet."
0, NANA devotes too much screen time to its filmmaker and not enough to her Auschwitz-survivor grandmother who relates riveting tales of her wartime experiences.
2, Raising the dead one trick at a time
0," Trouble is, it isn't just Polly who comes along: Lots of extraneous matter does, too."
0, The result is a mediocre showdown with a guessable twist.
0," The Last Knight is pretty much everything you'd expect from a Transformers movie. Stuff whizzes by, bursting into flames, in a jumbled blur of random images, noises and good old-fashioned gibberish."
2," Life is the smartest, sharpest version of man vs. ET to come along in a long while."
0, If I Stay is true to principle in one significant regard: It makes no concessions to anyone outside its teenage female cohort.
2, It will likely stick with you for hours afterward. Hopefully longer.
0," It is only James, which his intuitive gift for physical comedy and a quirky emotional sincerity, that makes the slog a little less sloggy. Key word: little"
0, Weakly entertaining Middle Ages fantasy.
2, Gosh only knows when you'll ever have another chance to see a blooper reel of spills set to Vivaldi.
2," [Vincent van Gogh: A New Way of Seeing] is a sober, sensitive assessment and straightforward presentation that reminds viewers of van Gogh's humanity and breathtaking art. "
0," Though it beeps and flashes in lots of different colors, it's not actually that good, or thought through, or well-executed."
2," A movie that grows on you...Underneath layers of anger, sarcasm, profanity and booze, Bad Santa ultimately reveals a soft heart."
0," Can't be described as much more than mildly intriguing, and its dramatic turn near the close is a downer in more ways than one."
2, It's mostly entertaining but can't find a consistency to its mysterious take on time travel.
0," ...a movie that fails for much the same reason the 2003 Ben Stiller/Drew Barrymore vehicle Duple"" did."
0," Charmless and witless, this tiresome comedy fails as notalgic tribute to the beloved TV series and as contempo reimagining due to lack of chemistry between Ferrell and Kidman"
0," It's one hell of a yarn, which makes The Lovers and the Despot's strangely soporific style something of a disappointment."
0, A watchable semi-terrible exploitation picture...
0, The film makes an analogy between sex and fly-fishing - and fly-fishing comes off as more intriguing.
0," It's just two and a half years of - sorry, two and a half hours - of oceanic screen savers and hair that won't stop undulating so we know when we're underwater."
2," Pablo Larraín's film, before a biopic, is a movie that plays with the dispute of who is its protagonist, whether the poet or the detective who pursues him. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, The humor gets dark but the future looks bright for Robespierre and Slate.
0, American Assassin can't sustain its early momentum to the finish line.
0, It's time Wes Anderson moved beyond the mixture of damage and quirky creativity neglectful parents can cause.
2," Has the viewer well and truly captured in its lonely, wretched basis."
0, ...The movie seems to have been crafted on an assembly line that specializes in inspirational tales of ordinary Davids triumphing over merciless Goliaths.
0," If you don't like Hillary Clinton, you'll find a lot here to give you comfort, but there's no way any intellectually honest critic could make the case that it's a good movie."
0," This may be dreadfully exciting, like any fear-based action movie scenario, but it's also an incomplete, misleading summary of what the AI community believes about this topic."
0, The result is a relentlessly dour film livened up only by Bardem's shameless scenery-chewing and the occasional jolt of action. 
2," Much of The Extra Man concerns Henry, portrayed with relentless propulsion by Kevin Kline."
0, It [the book] bored me to tears and sucked the life out of my summer vacation. The movie is much better and gets an above average rating only because it is days shorter.
0," The derivative work doesn't deliver scares so much as a few starts, all while ripping off such genre classics as ""Candyman"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."""
0, What we end up with is little more than a Christmas pageant with better production values.
0," The heavyweight title bout between Batman and Superman is a smash to the senses, the same way being tossed around in a rollover car accident would jolt one's system."
0," While Bassett's performance deserves a better forum than Perry can provide, she gives his latest movie a sense of dignity its predecessors lacked."
2," Herzog is a superb interviewer, never bludgeoning the interviewees with his power as filmmaker nor shying away out of discretion or discouragement."
0," In the end, ""Equals"" doesn't even have the courage of its science fiction convictions, but Stewart and Hoult make the romance work."
0, Decidely average teen drama but with a few decent dance numbers.
0," A generic, fitfully funny mainstream comedy that doesn't nearly get the best from its name-brand players but doesn't qualify as a desecration, either."
2," Fun and interesting for a while before losing its appeal, ""Nerve"" ends up running out of that in the final act. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - Available)"
2," ...a fast-paced, beautifully-shot thriller set in contemporary China, and a film that would be well worth seeing even if the subject matter were not so timely."
2," Powerfully emotional and exquisitely romantic, this is a beautifully made and wonderfully acted film that has every element working together in perfect harmony."
2," [Many will] be dissatisfied by a film that would rather evoke than supply. I understand that, and I think Terrence Malick does, too. But here he has attempted to reach more deeply than that: to reach beneath the surface, and find the soul in need."
0," Cynical and lazy, The Best of Me feels as if it's assembled from parts of other, better weepies."
0, Not helped by an unnervingly dumb screenplay and a performance from Tatum that makes wood seem too pliable a substance with which to describe it.
2," Breezy, quirky romcom is predictable but sweet."
0, Apatow gives us a couple who know less about each other than I do about my middle school friends on Facebook
2, A singularly full-hearted and moving film.
2," Scott has directed a phenomenal film --- one that will be a real crowd-pleaser. It's impossible for it not to be --- the adventure is intense, frightening and coming so close to being a reality."
0," Me Before You has no interest in the realities of life with disability; it is, rather, yet another variant on a threadbare formula."
2, This is a special motion picture that achieves its higher agenda of doing much more than idly plucking at a few heartstrings.
2, A warm film that moves between documentary and fiction. [Full review in Spanish]
2, Steve Carell is square-jawed-deadpan perfect as the title character.
2, A spiky script that skewers the contemporary liberal elite is clearly relished by the splendid cast. 
2," It's classic Hindi movie fluff, updated with modern filmmaking styles."
0," One wish[es] James could have followed him and his family from the beginning of their year-long adventure, rather than being swept in at the emotional tail end."
0, There isn't anything that special to it. It doesn't rise above anything...disappointing despite a really strong performance from Jennifer Garner.
2, Game Night is hardly a game-changer but - with the help of a spirited cast and some inspired sequences - is elevated from pedestrian material into a perfect Friday night popcorn movie.
0," The actors try their best to transcend the flimsy script and unappealing direction, but ultimately the movie offers a mostly hollow experience that delivers a night that you will struggle to remember."
0," It's not all bad. But there are wasted, senseless scenes of characters about to head to the Quidditch pitch for a game that doesn't happen and time-eating speeches about how ""This could mean the end of Hogwarts"" (Crikey, again?)"
2," Brutally honest, Beautifully hopeful"
0," Doesn't belong anywhere near the best animated picture race, but you can do a lot worse when looking for a family flick to pass the time."
2," A chilling, mesmerizing, intense account of ethnic cleansing (in spirit if not in letter) from Hungarian master Bela Tarr."
2," This is a blueprint for mainstream moviegoing, but be forewarned that the finale is surprisingly down-and-dirty. In this case, though, the violence blisteringly redeems what has been a merely OK thriller."
0, Anyone expecting anything more risky will be sadly disappointed.
0, There's no getting past the nonsense formality of taking that camera everywhere.
2," Keaton is fascinating as Kroc, a bad guy who embodies the American Dream - a man who isn't necessarily the best or most talented but who's willing to step on anyone to get ahead."
2," Centered around a rude surprise, The D Train has some guts, and I like that in a movie. It earns points for trying."
2," As a psychodrama about a troubled mother and daughter, this movie is gripping from start to finish."
2, Uproarious comedy that film buffs should love.
0, squarely aimed at the type of audience willing to overlook all sorts of inconsistencies and stereotypes in a movie as long as it includes a few juicy toilet jokes.
0," [I Am Number Four] is a die-cast plastic creation, almost devoid of anything memorable."
2," Should make people sit up and pay attention, not only due to Sciamma's naturalistic script and instinctive directing, but also the remarkable ensemble of young talent that she has consolidated into one film."
2," But the power of Titanic didn't come from originality; it came from punching clichés across with a seldom-seen directness and sincerity that seemed pure of heart, ""old-fashioned,"" or plain corny, depending on your perspective."
0," The movie is a near-total dud, endless at 93 minutes, useful only as an intro to the strip for the benefit of those who have been in a coma since 2950."
2, A film of rare empathy and shimmering beauty.
0, Not even Leo in top form can stop you clock-watching during this lengthy biopic.
0, The film's numerous idiosyncrasies-virtues at the outset-ultimately suffocate it.
2, Chiwetel Ejiofor dishes out another magnetic performance despite a storyline that wavers from innovative to obvious.
2," This adaptation of R.L. Stine's million-selling series of horror novels for younger readers comes within a hair's breadth of Lego Movie-level ingenious, and occasionally touches Gremlins-level sinister into the bargain."
0," Wedding isn't telling a story so much as selling a lifestyle - one that, rather like Heigl's morning sickness, makes you want to vomit."
2," Invited to sit in the facing seat, we have long minutes to watch, listen and assess, considering who these pilgrims are and what, aside from worship, has really brought them here."
0, The biggest flaw of Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away is that it's not really a movie at all. It's more like a super-long commercial for the Canadian entertainment company.
2, One of the most detailed and enthralling political dramatic thrillers ever made.
0," Though the movie is ostensibly a thriller, its suspense is only intermittent."
0, There's not much enlightenment to be found in this dreary slog of a drama.
0, sitting through this 'Psycho' is like watching a team of Kinkos employees assembling the world's most lavish Xerox job.
0," Changeling is little more than a frustrating missed opportunity that's dressed to the nines, but a day late for the party."
2," Featuring cinema's best bus-related stunt sequence, a spectacular finale in a shopping mall and, um, multiple instances of its star getting hit in the face with cake."
0, The Thor saga continues with this terminally underwhelming entry...
0," The rest of the film is on autopilot, with comic material that's spread thinner than the lone brain cell the Butabis share."
0," The result is only occasionally pathos, the tone Kon seems to be striving for."
0," We're treated to the bizarre spectacle of Ronan arguing with herself repeatedly over which guy to kiss. But since both are similarly bland, it barely matters."
0, This film by Stephen Norrington doesn't soar nearly enough above ordinary.
2," How some of the scenes were pulled off is still a mystery to this critic, and all the better for it, as the film has plenty of flair and tension to suck just about anybody into its story."
2," ""Rango"" is proof that not all new animated films need to go the gimmicky way of 3-D."
2," Courage, of the Phantom Thread variety, is less a matter of tangible objects and action than something ephemeral. "
2," If movies are vivid and wholly constructed fantasies, then movies about vivid and wholly constructed fantasies have a certain purity. "
2," Snyder has brought a different edge to the superhero genre, one that questions what drives these men of steel and creatures of the night to do what they do and believe what they believe. There is something to admire in that."
0," Ryuhei Kitamura is 37, but he makes films like a 25-year-old fanboy. That is, he has no sense of story, his visual style is basically point-and-shoot, the boys are cool and rebellious and the girls are cute."
2," Scares are still rudimentary, but rooted in a sharper script."
2, It's not that they don't make comedies like After Hours anymore. The fact is there's never been a comedy quite like this one.
2, Grim account of the real life horror of terrorists attack on Mumbai in 2008 is too close for comfort but effective as filmmaking.
2," The questions posed about journalistic ethics, personal integrity, and the problematic high of wartime reporting are all worth considering."
2," Jeff, Who Lives at Home offers escapism of a different kind, an entertaining reminder that good people sometimes prevail, and that living by your own Yoda logic in your own universe may not be such a bad thing."
2, Tintin is the kind of strap-in-and-hang-on adventure that will endure.
2, Patti Cake$ just feels stuck between being a music video and a fully realized film.
0," Thanks to the intelligence of both actors, it starts out OK, with initial dates that have a teasing, flirty quality. But they soon become insufferably cloying ..."
0," That its climax comes in the middle of a rendition of the national anthem -- at a citizenship ceremony, no less -- tells you how badly it pins the needle on the subtlety meter."
2," An old-fashioned, beautifully crafted nature documentary for family audiences."
0," It's a well-meaning tonal mess, but respect to Watts. She never stops trying, even when playing violent video games with gusto for reasons nobody will ever work out. "
2," If, as the film suggests, true greatness is defined by the willingness to fail, fail big and still stick around afterwards, then consider Elizabethtown a sweet, melancholy paean to that sad truth."
0, Well intentioned but underwhelming.
2, The film is more successful as an exercise in style than it is as a gripping observation of the real world.
2," It might be a little dense and too serious in its tone, but the story is shocking and allows you to really get to know the characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Ma appears to have been written, shot, and cut with the words ""visceral"" and ""surreal"" hammering every corner of Rowlson-Hall's directorial reach."
2," ""Break Point"" has its difficulties with storytelling and tone, but it carries most of the way, finding a rich sense of humor on and off the court."
2, A couple of notches above many other imported and domestic actioners.
2," It gives the audience a seriocomic rush. The filmmakers never figure out a full and satisfying ending for a real-life story that culminates in a paralyzing injustice. But if the climactic shocks are just sketched in, the others are vivid and alive. "
0," Plastic is an unpredictable, albeit convoluted production that bears many twists and turns for the audience to enjoy."
0, Veers too much and too often into the realm of palpable manipulation.
0, We really don't want to wander the celestial landscape with Susie forever. It is a maudlin place where everyone resembles relieved sufferers from a pharmaceutical commercial.
0," Despite Stallone's bantamweight attempts to insert, like, character into the fifth Rocky, it's the same old fight with the same old round of regulars."
2," Le Quattro Volte is cinematic slow food. It takes its time, is meticulous in its presentation, carefully considers the experience it provides, and then serves up a satisfying and nourishing feast."
0," Turgid, overinflated, pseudo-philosophical, bogus radicalism from the Wachowski brothers."
0," The tone here is inconsistent to say the least, and screenwriter James McBride, who also wrote the film's source novel, doesn't take any one character's point of view throughout, leaving the narrative decidedly unfocused."
2, This is as accessible and as lovable as avant-garde filmmaking ever gets.
2," Worth seeing for a luminous performance by Felicity Jones, who's even more impressive than she was in Chalet Girl."
2," It's as rich and strange and riveting as any journey he's taken us on, yet it's also familiar in a disquieting way."
2, One can only wonder if Four Brothers would have gone from good to great if Singleton balanced the exit wounds with something more than skin deep. 
0," The Purge: Election Year is an OK sequel for die-hard fans of the series, but it won't win any new converts."
2, A space shot worth taking.
2," There are so many red herrings and plot twists, such a dense barrage of flashbacks and quick cuts, that you may find yourself as rattled and breathless as Ig himself."
2," Chloe's aesthetic is both distancing and, largely on the strength of Moore's translucent performance and Seyfried's boldness, forcibly intimate."
0, Dire and dunderheaded.
0," Biggs may have the comically compulsive anxiety thing down pat, but he just doesn't have the screen presence to make it compelling - especially when breaking the fourth wall to talk to the audience."
0, The film is so tasteful that you might barely realise the story involves a man having his penis surgically removed at a time when such a thing was barely known or possible.
2," The spine of the story has been entrusted to Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx, who make all their moments in The Soloist count."
2, ou either go with the fantasy and enjoy the impossible acts of kinetic creativity or get stuck in the preposterousness of the premise and the flippant execution.
0," There are many unintentionally funny moments in a movie that wants to be taken seriously but is derailed by listless direction, tired acting, and a corny script."
2," A solid filmmaker who delivers nearly flawless pictures, Clint Eastwood is in fine form with Million Dollar Baby."
0," Though Dumont sets a painstakingly slow pace, Céline's story feels maddeningly incomplete, and vague both in theological and psychological terms"
2," Love, Simon is extraordinary in a very ordinary way."
2," An impressive feat, a giant accomplishment. See this movie in IMAX and the end will take your breath away."
2, Watching 82 minutes of it in a theater made me as giddy and hyper as if I'd eaten a pound of cotton candy and washed it down with crack.
0," A conventional Hollywood comedy boasting a bolder indie heart, the film essentially combines the worst of both worlds."
2," [It's] that rare film utterly without heroes; instead, it amasses a group of boobs, users, and charlatans on both sides of the Atlantic and asks us to recognize our duly elected and appointed officials. You'll laugh until you bleed, or vice versa."
0," Pretty, yet uneven, Cheri could have been much more had the details in its story matched that in its production design. "
2, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the movie that Kick-Ass wishes it could be when it grows up.
2," ... pay your money and take the ride,... laugh and ... be strangely moved by the odd-looking creatures Russell has assembled for his latest ensemble play."
2, It is quite a yarn.
2," On the surface, THE DEAD ZONE looks like a very good film..."
0," Seems to want nothing more than for the audience to pat itself on the back because they know what Yavin 4 is: It's a fun game to play at Comic-Con, but it doesn't make for much of a movie."
0," The Danish Girl is content to quietly admire its own importance, and assume you will too."
2," Taylor, Burton, and Harrison are sublime in this sweeping epic of love and nations."
2," Look through the haze of weed and the raunchy jokes and you'll see a movie that's grown up with its audience, its subject matter and its subjects--and gotten even funnier in the process."
0," Moments of madcap hilarity are strung together poorly, making the flick feel like a series of skits rather than a movie."
0, The effect of piling on twist upon twist is to have the viewer totally wrung out and exasperated by the end.
2," The Innkeepers starts unevenly, but ratchets up the tension until the explosively weird finale. And it will teach you to cover your freakin ears."
0," A few sequences have a certain sting... but, for the most part, the film seems to run on autopilot."
0," Victoria's Secrets: Octomom plus one party animal who wears the pants, or rather crown in the family, and later for Charles Dickens."
0," Frankly, if you believe this twaddle, you'll believe anything, and if you believe anything, you don't need to go to the films -- you can just sit at home and fantasise for free."
2," Balancing big laughs and big shocks, Attack the Block is a brilliant first film by anybody's standards."
2," Guggenheim weaves the 3 stories around and through each other in perfect counterpoint. He virtually disappears into the eye of the camera, allowing us to take it all in from the best seats in the house."
2," Proof is a stirring motion picture that challenges our views on a great many things about life, some of which we take for granted."
2," Much more than a simple commentary on race, class and police brutality, The Hate U Give is a standout film because it focuses on black female empowerment."
0, ... an unremarkable documentary about the San Francisco politico...
0," The kind of rom-com that insults its primary audience and panders to their dates, ""War"" is depressingly mean-spirited."
2," Serpent is a well-crafted, intimate thriller that will coil around you and never let you loose until the final, death-dealing bite."
0," It's an exhausting, clumsy mess, and its moments of excitement are eventually toppled by the unstoppable tsunami of cheese."
2," While the story and characterizations are weak, the action is as good as you'll see in any film."
2," The movie boasts a stellar cast, even in the smallest roles, and they play their parts with gusto. Stardust has a sense of whimsy and quirky humor missing from many fantasy hits. "
0," If Disney insists on raiding its own vaults for remakes, maybe they'll have better luck with The Laser-Vision, Missile-Launching, Face-Shredding Cat from Outer Space."
0," Many gun battles and fiery explosions ensue, all of them free of excitement or suspense...Saldana and Morgan have the chemistry of two strangers who just met at a tax audit. "
0, ...so predictable in the way that it manipulates your emotions that it leaves you feeling like the victim of a con game.
0, A few striking scenes don't unite for a satisfying whole. Streep's powerfully measured performance is something greater than the film that holds it.
0," The concept of beauty being only skin deep is referred to several times, yet is buried under the unrelentingly unpleasant parade of ""rhino"" gags."
0, I left the theater entertained but not fully satisfied.
2," Eugène Green's mannered direction doesn't work for every situation it's homogenously applied to, but at its most effective it inspires an enhanced sensitivity to the import of every gesture, visual or verbal."
0, The film's curdled aftertaste is so frustrating that it may be hard to remember why Must Love Dogs ever seemed so endearing and entertaining in the first place.
0, A grueling thing to endure.
2," Bonello makes good use of mirrors and reflective surfaces throughout the film, all very fitting for a story about a boy as beautiful and as self-absorbed as Narcissus himself."
0," This is the kind of movie that prompted Michael Haneke to make Funny Games twice, and while I loathed that moralistic scold of a film, Last House almost made me concede Haneke's point."
0," We don't learn enough about Jones away from her cancer. And because Jones is not especially insightful about her disease (not many people could be), we don't learn enough about her within it, either."
2," A slight but engaging vignette about the peculiarities of the artistic temperament, 'Final Portrait'...doesn't do much, but the little it does, it does pleasantly enough."
0," It's admirable that Garner wants to expand beyond the bubbly romantic-comedy and supportive mom roles that have been her bread-and-butter, but it would have been nice if she had taken a knife to the script and demanded something better."
0," It's a mess, but ""Roman J. Israel, Esq."" isn't an unpleasant one, maintaining signs of life with turns of plot and the sheer force of Denzel Washington's lead performance."
2," An absurd, if overpolished, gem of all-too-human proportions!"
0," There just isn't enough in the movie, despite its marvelous design, to warrant another visit to this material."
0," ... incoherent fantasy adventure filled with swordplay, sorcery and supernatural nonsense."
2," A sweet, breezy romcom with likeable characters presented in glossy, lavish, true Karan Johar style."
2," I don't know what tone Darcey Bell's source novel strikes, but Jessica Sharzer's adaptation plays like a meta parody and perfect send up of Gone Girl, Girl on the Train and all their imitators."
2," Beautifully crafted, and sensationally well acted, it overflows with romance, heart and intelligence."
0, The tut-tuttingly dull script refuses to supply a single happy line until Hunt squares up to the sudden arrival of Bette Midler.
0," A thoroughgoing deconstruction of humanity as well as heroism, one that takes its world apart without putting it back together again. There are things to admire here, but Watchmen doesn't make me care."
2," There is a lot to like in Gareth Huw Evans' ambitious folk horror tale, Apostle. The problem might be that there is just too much of everything to really fall in love."
2," This really is Irish cinema at its best, a truly transcendent and palpable experience shedding glorious light on an issue all too relevant from a bold and emphatic director at the top of his game."
0," A stereotypical response to Teenage from today's attention span-deprived youth would be, ""Ugh, whatever."" They'd be right."
2, Villeneuve sets a bar for sci-fi sequels.
2, In its own way it displays considerable daring in evoking some of the darkest aspects of the American consciousness and its manifestation in practice. The film's power derives from the fact that it does this amusingly and with irony.
2," With a harder commitment to the macabre, a recast lead and the abolishment of the love triangle, this could have been a minor classic."
0," Its marshaling of the facts is one-sided, leaving many questions, and considerable scientific evidence, unexplored."
0," The movie feels like it is perpetually in conflict, torn between its desire to be both a light-hearted fable and a dark black comedy."
0," Need For Speed fails spectacularly on so many levels, it almost begs you to bring back the hyperactive, overacting Nicolas Cage for Drive Angry 2. Almost."
0, It's not that I was offended. It's that I was bored by the attempt to offend me.
0," One of those 'inspired by a true story' things as concerns its premise, but in reality it feels more 'inspired by Nicholas Sparks.'"
0, I can't say that I enjoyed watching Gigli but it certainly was an instructive lesson in how good ideas can go horribly wrong.
2," This medieval thriller is cleverly shot and edited to crank up quite a bit of tension, even as the over-the-top grisliness and wacky religious overtones make it nothing much more than a cheap thrill."
0," Confine makes clever use of its single-location shots, but the flawed script and a weak and inexperienced performance by Daisy Lowe means it ultimately falls flat."
2, Director Erik Skjolbjærg knows how to create a claustrophobic setting and he gets first class performances from his cast. The physical discomfort shown by the crew is palpable. Despite some plotholes it holds interest until just before the ending.
0, A movie needs a reason to exist other than to wring tears out of overemotional people.
2, It works all right as sort of cinematic comfort food.
0," The script undercuts the measured performances with blunt, melodramatic proclamations."
0, This is a movie in which everything feels vaguely familiar.
2, ...creativity for the sheer joy of it.
0," Fails to offer much insight into the long-term relationship that, as the movie argues, helped her turn the corner after the dissolution of her marriage to Prince Charles."
0," Feeling like a collection of Disney Princess greatest hits with a Southern flair, this latest Disney animated feature may look gorgeous but it's lacking in ""magic."""
2," It's an inspiring story, acted with heart and grit by Paige and Wood, and film directed with adroitness by Rozema in a ruin of a set in the woods."
2," [The] rare blockbuster that finds a compelling middle ground between thoughtfulness and big, splashy spectacle. "
2, A pleasant comedy-adventure.
2," Sandler has great self-awareness and lets us laugh with him, at him and on occasion feel for a rich, spoiled superstar."
0, Out of nowhere comes Brandon Routh and into nowhere he returns.
2," This is the very definition of an entertaining period piece romp. It's a romp, I tell ya!"
0, It's hard to enjoy all that naval carnage when the people on the ships are just as wooden as the planks.
0," This regurgitation of science-fiction clichés features one-dimensional characters and unconvincing, if somewhat charming, special effects."
2," ""It Follows"" is a fine title, blending a logician's briskness with the job description of a stalker, and David Robert Mitchell, the writer and director, has fun with his various predators."
2," Six women, among the last survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp, tell stories of their shattering experiences in that camp and how they prevailed to the present day."
0," According to one American critic, Three Times is 'why cinema exists.' Only if you think that cinema has no higher calling that presenting a long series of gorgeously lit closeups of beautiful actresses are you likely to agree."
0," As a TV-to-movie remake, LOTL ranks with Lost In Space: fitfully entertaining, largely uninspired. Ferrell does his best, but ends up stranded in the middle of an ideas desert."
0," Lame horror entry about a woman who gives birth to a literal little monster won't scare up the bucks, in spite of post-fest hype."
0," Watts employs a number of iconic head tilts, hairdos and stick-on noses, but fights a losing battle against a film which has neither backbone nor teeth ..."
0," The film's impulse to profess a knowing, snarky superiority can become painfully awkward."
0," It has Kevin Bacon. How bad could it be? Bacon makes everything better, whether it be a cheesy movie or a cheeseburger! I'll never think that again as this movie becomes more absurd by the moment."
2," In a world where bad news cascades through our various screens and seems to compound every week, there's something comforting about the notion of not moving forward until this one damn problem gets definitively solved."
0," Sadly, the flabby script doesn't offer this talented actor nearly enough to sink his teeth into. I spent the first half rolling my eyes and the second half fighting to keep them open."
2," The way he finds to live and to die as a Catholic Jew may not satisfy any of the film's characters, but I'll say that I found it really touching."
2," Stephens and Katz basically rely on the immense screen charisma of their two principals, which largely bails them out."
0," The ultimate problem with Munich is that it's looking for a clear-cut answer that doesn't exist. And while it frames its final act as an argument, it's an argument it's having with itself."
0," Despite featuring this cast and having some relevant, promising material, this terrorist thriller never engages us. It slow boils its way to a ludicrous, contrived wrapup that's almost laughably silly."
0," While the filmmakers' control of mood, menacing atmosphere and unsettling spatial dynamics remains arresting, their story sense grows shaky in a chiller that starts out strong but becomes meandering and repetitive."
0, My dad deserves better.
2," If these movies have done nothing else, they have shown great skill in playing directly to a target audience, never swaying from that mission, and doing it exceptionally well."
0, You'll cringe in horror at the stinkfest on screen.
2," I like to imagine watching this chilling Australian horror film with late, great authors Shel Silverstein, Roald Dahl and Edward Gorey - all of whom would have relished its twisted children's storybook at the center of things."
0," It sounds madcap, but it's not. Non-Fiction is instead a largely sedate puzzle-box of coy insinuations. "
2," Reboot is fun, but scarier, more violent than the original."
0," ""Brigsby Bear"" is the kind of movie Kyle Mooney would make fun of on ""Saturday Night Live."""
2," Tumbbad [is] a fascinating journey into Indian horror with a timely, relevant historical twist."
2," The crises Ivan Locke faces with a tremendous will to do the right thing strike a chord. The mistakes that have him in the driver's seat, but hardly in control, are terribly human and all too familiar."
2," The dialogue tends to be declamatory on occasions, the characters are either black or white, no pun intended, and it's all a little bit earnest and overlong. But nevertheless, this is history at its most fascinating."
0," It aims to be powerful and gritty, but merely succeeds in being dreary and grungy."
2, A movie that kids would love and adults can watch without getting bored. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Shyamalan might've been onto something if Lady in the Water were, say, a satire of Scientology; instead, it's a mission for a bedtime story, a badly told fairy tale."
2, Zhang Yang achieves an astonishing immediacy by simply allowing the prostration process to play out over and over with minimal aesthetic interference. 
0," Jason Statham and James Franco squaring off over meth with a script by Sylvester Stallone? Sounds like a guilty pleasure, right? Unfortunately, the result is a rather rote action thriller that only comes alive during the well-staged fight scenes. "
0," Rodin's work and legacy seem to contain more intrigue than his personal life, despite the effort of Doillon's reverential screenplay to prove otherwise."
0," Jack Black's amazing comic energy, as seen in films like 'School of Rock' and 'Nacho Libre,' seems a bit muted in 'Gulliver's Travels.' I expected more from him here. "
0," Monster House benefits from strong graphic design and lovely lighting, but the script is nothing to write home about."
0, Indian Horse blunts the edges of a vivid personal drama in favour of an inarguably correct public service announcement.
0," SUPERFLY turns out to not be very good. Despite boasting a director whose name screams, ""TOO MUCH STYLE,"" the film looks generic as can be."
2," This is Ferrell's movie, meaning some inspired laughs sandwiched between annoying bits that stretch on well past their usefulness."
0," Streep, as usual, is all hand gestures and eye flutters, speaking softly while carrying a big shtick."
0," Assisted by passionless central performances and dull dialogue, Mungiu succeeds only in exhausting our patience, not in conveying a message."
2, [I]t is an entertaining and subversive conversation-starter.
0, There is little point going into the motives of the man calling the shots in Damien Chazelle's script as they are ridiculous and ill-conceived.
2," Widows is the best crime drama of the year. Director Steve McQueen and co-writer Gillian Flynn fire on all cylinders. The story, acting, and filmmaking are par excellence in the genre."
0," A mean spirited film that's not funny, clever or imaginative enough to make the barbs and jabs easier or at least more entertaining to swallow."
0, McG tries to turn This Means War into a cool pop confection along the lines of his Charlie's Angels movies. But pouring on the douchey hipness and charm only makes things worse.
0," Seventy minutes of pneumatic sex without the trappings of characterization, plot or even attempted meaning can be a profoundly long time."
2," Even though Lawrence's act is getting repetitive, it's still good enough to make for an amusing time."
0," Considering that Disney couldn't help but trash Victor Hugo's novel in the process of reforming it for tender young sensibilities, this animated adaptation of his Notre Dame de Paris is pricklier and more disturbing than we had any right to expect."
0, By the final scenes you may feel like you're overdosing on a cake that's all frosting.
0, A disappointing brew of slick commercial moviemaking and old-fashioned romantic fantasy!
0, Scarcely enough story for a half-hour TV sitcom.
2," An efficient, sprightly sports doc about the rise and fall of 2990s cycling superstar Marco Pantani."
2," There is considerable anguish in Eastwood's storytelling, and an almost palpable sense of moral outrage - understandable, given the indignities Christine Collins was made to suffer."
2, This suitably giddy addition maintains high standards of juvenile silliness while still providing the requisite cheeky winks for mums and dads too.
2," It's all fun in its own (by now) very far-fetched way but reinforces the sense that Godzilla movies will never fully be able to transcend their own innate, cheesy preposterousness."
2, Feminism in Mongolia is given its due in a soaring film that should have the attention of awards groups for its spellbinding cinematography.
2," George's ace in the hole is his subject herself. Copeland is captivating, oozing talent and charisma in equal parts."
2," Asking more questions than it answers and playing out like a thriller, The Cleaners takes us into a dark and disquieting world of social media policing."
0, a nicely played but all-too-preciously eccentric romance
2," [Moana] has supercharged wit, eye-popping visuals featuring azure seas and glowing coral, spirited voice work from Auli'i Cravalho as Moana and Dwayne Johnson."
0," Walker is by far the movie's biggest liability, a walking vacuum in the time-space continuum with a terrifying ability to commit heinous crimes against cinema dialogue."
2," Morante, Spada and Gassman are pretty strong here under Falcone's direction, and yet Giallini rather overacts."
0," Bless her heart, but Thomas is a 58 year-old director making a movie that is meant for tween slumber parties. It's an uphill battle she can't fight in good faith, leaving Tucker a dreary, autopilot directing job."
2," Imagined with large doses of wit and brio, Roald Dahl's children's story is a larger than life fantasy for all ages, brilliantly adapted to the screen and showcasing voice talents led by George Clooney as the likeably roguish Mr. Fox."
0," It's a collection of patterns, all realized without much visual bravado or self-examination. Which, for a film about a novelist and painter is... well, you know. "
0," In space, no one can hear you groan, since sound does not carry in a vacuum. Theaters showing Ghosts of Mars will not have this advantage, so the film's inanities will be audible and visible."
2," Kinky, captivating, even downright Continental: a Godard or Bertolucci plot given European-standard subtlety from Moore."
0," The Green Hornet isn't a Michel Gondry film, but a Seth Rogen film to which Gondry has been strapped and forced to say the word ""Action!"", seemingly at gunpoint."
0," A passable afternoon's entertainment this film brings, Though somewhere Shakespeare is banging his head."
0," A hollow, two-hour blast of stifling backstory, product placement, and big-budget nonsense."
0, Closer to Patch Adams than Ace Ventura.
0," A rude and raucous LA cesspool reality check especially for star struck audience obsessives, the film walks an exceedingly fine line between exposing Hollywood self-dehumanization, and crossing it. Along with retaliatory menstruation, and other delights. "
2," Thanks to 3D technology it's dance film quite unlike any other, which was filmmaker Wim Wenders' intention, and it's a transporting experience for the uninitiated and the cognoscenti alike."
2," Based on a true story, it's the historical aspect of these events that holds the attention, even though the filmmakers kind of let the drama slip through their fingers."
2, Billingham's Ray & Liz story is precise and rooted in the stark bleak facts of his growing up with alcoholic uncaring parents. He presents those years in a few set pieces written and directed as if a crime were being committed.
2, The story is a winner and so is this film by Aviva Kempner.
0," Framed as a relationship-on-the-skids drama, Monogamy is instead a shallow and unconvincing look at male psychosexual pathology."
2, This movie loves Halloween so much you can almost taste the candy corn.
0, Fanboys is an amiable but disjointed movie that identifies too closely with its heroes. Poking a little more fun at them would have been a great idea.
2," Refreshingly free-form, rough-riffing, pastiche portrait of an era."
2," Designed to trigger a strong emotional response, and nobody can rightfully deny that it does so."
0," It hasn't any rhythm at all, just a string of downbeats and a hackneyed old tune that equates mere survival with heroism."
0," If you think the name is inelegant, wait until you see the movie."
2, Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz on a wild and suspenseful ride.
0," The history of the man who gave the literary world such alternately acclaimed and vilified works as Portnoy's Complaint,Sabbath's Theater and I Married a Communist is continuously glossed over. "
0, It relies heavily on wacky plot developments and routine gross-out gags like a guy excusing himself from his lad-love's bed on their big night so he can suffer sudden-onset diarrhea.
0," Continues to be little more than the female equivalent to porn, a fashionable but unrealistic fairy tale with very little actual meat, but this time, it feels more like a cash grab."
2," The acting can be so-so, the story implausible, the camerawork stolid -- none of that really matters if you care about what happens to the characters."
2, The Exorcist meets Inception in the head-spinning affair Incarnation. 
0, Undead is the sort of movie that people in other horror movies are watching.
0, The charm of listening to 20- and 22-year-old children swearing at one another begins to wear off quickly.
2," Glides with sorrowful grace, pitching at a respectful and tear-inducing tone."
0," Dite's limited awakening is neither tragedy nor the kind of bitter, fatalistic farce seen in Lina Wertmuller's Seven Beauties."
2," Never, never bores me. Glabe is fabulous!"
0," While it's fascinating to watch the killer evolve, the fact that he's always onscreen detracts from his mystique. Hannibal derives much of his intrigue from his mystery."
0," Given more rope, and a slightly bigger budget, Boris seems to offer less than what's on the surface, perhaps because that surface, while initially attractive, seems so self-consciously designed."
2," It's rare for a film about a Mexican drug cartel and the impossibility of the American Dream to be either disarming or funny, but Clint Eastwood has blessedly delivered one that is consistently both."
2," Baumbach tends to be at his best when capturing NYC bustle and interpersonal awkwardness, offering a loosely plotted character examination that's periodically hilarious and charmingly restless. "
0," As a tortured soul for whom beauty is power, Charlize Theron pulls out all the stops, but director Rupert Sanders doesn't know when to rein her in and some of her scenes tip over into ranting."
0," Penny Chenery's story is good stuff. It's just that watching it, one can't escape the nagging feeling that it's not the most compelling part of the (Secretariat) story."
2, Yeah...it's good.
0, It focuses too heavily on flashy action sequences and lacks the amusing banter that I remember fondly from the original.
0," ""Joe"" is not handsome or especially smart, but like its namesake, the film has enough rough humor and respect for hard work to qualify as average."
2, Mom and Dad is a hyper-violent and darkly funny film that says all the things about parenting that parents aren't supposed to say. 
0, The screenwriters so excessively telegraph each plot twist that the entire script may well have been written in Morse code.
2," More fun than the cantina scene from Star Wars, Davy Jones and his barnacle-encrusted crew alone make this a must see!"
2," ...we fill in vast gaps because we know and presumably like the star. There's nothing really wrong with that, but Payne's done better work, more substantial work. "
0," Usually you can laugh with a bad movie it or laugh at it. But Snakes on a Plane is laughing at you. It not only fulfills the low expectations of its title, it Tasers them into submission."
2," Springsteen on Broadway distills everything that makes one of America's greatest singer-songwriter-rock stars such a formidable, genial, and inviting personalities into a single, visual volume. "
2," Unlike other movies where women bang their heads, this one's got a brain."
2, A brutally honest and open look at love.
2," Disney's Tarzan is not only the summer's most thrilling mainstream movie so far, it's also the best animated feature the studio has put out since The Lion King."
0," A derivative combination of Seven and Fear Factor, and a work of cynical corporate-style branding posing as independent hustle."
0, If there was an original idea in Jesse Gabe's screenplay it died of loneliness long before reaching the screen.
0," We can only say this is a movie equally disappointing and surprising, vibrant and dumb, eccentric and conservative. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," It's tender, clever, wise and highly recommended."
2," Now in his 70s, Woo has become fully self-aware, and in doing so seems to have challenged himself to create the most John Woo movie ever made."
0," I found 'Riddick' surprisingly good at the onset but with diminishing returns as it then plodded through familiar territory and a far too long, two hour running time. (Full Parental Review also available)"
2," Rough, rude and raucous."
2," If some of the movie's effects are distractingly shoddy (see: the unconvincing dancing donkey), Thompson is rather divine. "
2," The Duchess is largely successful because it manages to offer those degrees of humanity and romance (if not blandness) amidst the rest of its potent, bodice-ripping drama."
2," People cynically walk into so much expecting disappointment - auditoriums showing Woody Allen's annual crapshoot, for example. Sometimes, they get expected middling results. Sometimes, as with Allen's 30-year-old script, they get unanticipated surprises."
0, Here's the good news: the latest toy from George Lucas's soulless Star Wars factory is better than The Phantom Menace. Now the bad: it's not much better.
0," The effort is there, but nothing can save 'Click' from being another raunch-fest starring the emoting challenged Sandler."
2," Trumbo may not be filling, but in certain snappy moments, it's awfully tasty. "
2," Ted's real trick is turning a one-joke premise into a reasonable facsimile of a movie, and one that isn't entirely bent on grossing us out."
2, It's a bit ramshackle but good fun and enjoyably nostalgic.
2, Like a title bout that goes through seven rounds of friendly push and poke before exploding into a knockout combination.
0, You'll never look at an outhouse the same way again.
0," Bardem is superb, but this is a slog, lurching despite high-pressure editing and utterly oblivious to how the harsh-poetic compassion from Amores Perros has hardened into a rather gloating hunger for suffering."
2," Earl Stone is a more gregarious guy than Eastwood's cranky old man in Gran Torino, but they're cut from a similar non-conformist cloth. Touches on currents of regret and social alienation without undue seriousness."
0," If it wasn't for the charming top-liners who can make literary dialogue sound sexy in their sleep, the war in Fred Schepisi's Words and Pictures would have to be called off after the opening skirmish."
2, A mature drama that demands rapt attention and prefers studied execution over frenetic pacing.
2, While we're waiting for the next batch of monster make-overs - we're surely only one step away from Leatherface in Love - there's quite a bit to enjoy here.
2," ""Lucy"" ends up being one of the more pleasant surprises in this bleak summer, proving to be far more substantial than you'd expect. "
2, Being an alien among humans is scary and director Zack Snyder drives this point home showing the world through a young Kent's eyes.
0," Overlong and comedically uneven, A Million Ways to Die in the West spends far too much time treading water and nowhere near enough time being funny."
2, You'll walk out of this electrifying documentary about the Arab Spring with your blood boiling.
2," It gets one crucial element of comic filmmaking right in a way that few recent comedies have. It's cast, down to the smallest role, with genuinely funny performers, people who understand how to time a joke, deliver a setup, underplay a deadpan glance."
2," While the highly stylized set pieces are certainly eye catching, they start to feel disjointed and nonsensical."
2," 'Vice' makes up a review, perhaps outlined by brushstrokes too thick, but totally necessary to our contemporary history, essential to understand the current geopolitical situation. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," Like the TV series, the pic features makeup and special-effects gimmickry that are far less persuasive than what might be found at second-rate theme-park attractions."
0, It stagnates between stories and it extends too much towards the end. [Full review in Spanish]
0, MacFarlane has lost his way.
2," This isn't the confessional exposé some would hope, but it is a reverent profile of a fascinating, funny and inspirational gentleman."
0," The new SuperFly makes obvious drive-by observations about racism today, somewhere between its Scarface drama and Fast And Furious resolutions."
2," You simply wish there were more of this. It's not something that comes around every day. Shot in evocative black and white, The Party resurrects a classic screwball form."
2, Another heartfelt holocaust memoir. The nostalgia for the camps is really bizarre.
2, Entertaining tale of London housing-project youth battling vicious aliens should emerge as a cult hit.
2," [Briggs'] unique style of homeliness with an edge, ordinary lives charged with political content, told with quiet humour, has reached its highest point so far in the deeply affecting Ethel and Ernest and is another classic in the making."
0," Strong performances, but play adaptation is too talky."
0, Not. Much. Happens. What does is predictable and trite. But it's a genial trifle with a booty-shaking vibe.
0, This is a box of rancid chocolates of rare stupidity.
2," Kutcher and Portman have terrific screen physics, using their 22-inch height difference to considerable slapstick effect."
0," I wouldn't call this 2960 picture one of Billy Wilder's best comedies -- it's drab, sappy, and overlong at 225 minutes."
2," While the characters and situations may be a little too predictable and farcical for sustained enjoyable supervised viewing, there's an overall feeling of fun that emanates from the just-right running time."
2, The genius of this film is the way it keeps us laughing at the eccentricities while also challenging us to find a positive way to move forward with our lives.
0, The remake seems to have been written and directed by people whose only experience with children is the long-distant memory of having been kids themselves so many years ago.
2," Fuqua has a fairly conventional script for a war team film, but his feeling for the thick landscape and the people within it has moral thrust."
0, A couple of shots of rum would have been a good idea before watching this slow-burning French drama - it would have livened things up.
2, Dear Ex has good performances and a story that should be relatable to anyone who has gone through family problems as a kid.
2," The Master is ambitious, grave, inventive, flawed, and best of all, it's a sad story about a very sad man."
0," The Strangers suffers from lack of originality. I've seen most of this film in other movies, and as a horror fan, I found little that was new or innovative."
0, Scenes of painful turmoil play like skillful script readings rather than life events.
0," A shiny bauble full of dead weight, gloppy good feeling and airless cliches!"
0," There are some very impressive acting moments in this investigation into the parenting of a special child, but the dramatic payoff comes too late, after a lot of enervating palaver."
2, There is no question that it stays vividly in memory and is the kind of movie that sparks thoughtful conversation.
0," Stiller doesn't know when to stop; his thoroughly repellent character, whose relationship with pizza makes American Pie's pastry lover seem wholesome, verges on the unwatchable."
0," Polar mixes brooding, methodical kills with flashy gunfests to weird and baffling effect. There's humour, intentional and not, which combined with an admirably straight-faced performance from Mikkelsen meant I didn't watch it entirely through my fingers."
0," Too mucky and uneven to signify an out-and-out winner, but...charming when it wants to be and not nearly as bad as early word has suggested."
2," Screenwriter Rebecca Frayn's full feature debut is alluring, fascinating to watch and, most importantly, makes you care about Suu Kyi."
2," Even during Pi's bleakest moments lost at sea, Lee's artistry gives us something at which to marvel"
0," A mishmash of half-baked ideas, loud special-effects and disjointed imagery."
2," Neil proves compellingly gruff as a reluctant father figure, though it's the trash-talking, family-craving ten-year-old Dennison who steals the show, exuding a wacko, wounded attitude rooted in Ricky's backwoods Rambo-Scarface-Mad Max reveries."
0," The smell of flop-sweat permeates the movie like real sweat in a locker room. It's too bad to be offensive, too inert to be annoying."
2, Colossal is a giant monster movie like none we've ever seen before.
0," This sappy, crappy and condescending chick flick has been slapped together for those wishing to bask in the cinematic afterglow of the ever-radiant Sarah Jessica Parker."
0," In this 90-minute movie, which runs twice the length of one of the Ab Fab episodes airing stateside since the mid-Nineties, this deliciously bad behavior is diminished by a silly plot."
0," These numerous, disorganized plot points attempt to make up for the flimsy dialogue and hammy acting - flaws that weren't nearly so evident in last year's movie."
2," [William Shimell's] an engaging presence, cool and confident in front of the camera."
0," With many of the conversations going on simultaneously, it's difficult -- sometimes even impossible -- to know who is saying what and to whom."
0, Paper Towns is way outside the US tradition of high-school movies that are funny and sharp.
2," Gorgeously shot and edited, and performed with a gentle emotional openness, this gritty odyssey tells a deeply personal story while examining much bigger issues in Central America and beyond."
0," So ""inspirational"" it should mate with Cinderella Man and give birth to a litter of baby Oscars"
0," An innocuous, unappealing and in the end an absurdly violent revenge gangster film."
0," ""The Odd Life"" is not just odd, it's morbid and morose."
2, Contains the single drop-dead funniest moment in all of Carpenter's filmography.
2," If Lottery Ticket had as much conviction as laughs, it could have hit the jackpot."
0," This strenuously unfunny follow-up to the uneven but often uproarious Another Gay Movie duly maintains the original's levels of raunch and gross-out gags, but it all feels perfunctory, with comic inspiration distinctly lacking."
0," My suggestion is to hire a babysitter to take the kiddies --- then go see ""Silver Linings Playbook"" in a neighboring auditorium."
2, Rightfully considered one of the greatest accomplishments in sci-fi storytelling.
0, [The] script is filled with false notes and other hollow sentiments.
0, This expensive turkey will disappear from theatres more quickly than its protagonist fades into nothingness.
0," Racial diversity and girl power are dandy, but they cannot compensate for uninspired material."
0," Unfortunately, the movie stumbles a fair bit."
0, More infomercial than movie. For series fans only.
2, The most complex film made by Alfred Hitchcock.
0, Morris has learned a lot over the years about how to tell a story while gradually unveiling a personality. But I wish I had a better notion of what story he's trying to tell.
0," ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" isn't a terrible biopic, but as a film, it plays it too safe and keeps its characters from being fully realized. "
0," The silent scenes, which hold so much power in the first act, feel emptier and emptier, the closer the conclusion nears."
2," A great, genuinely unnerving horror movie."
2," It is, in fact, a fine piece of work: reticent, intelligent, wholly devoid of triumphalism or self-pity."
0," Proud Mary is an absolute mess, incoherent to the point of ineptitude, and certainly not something befitting the talents of its star."
2," If the kids think this is the scariest thing ever, then so be it."
2," Although there are some rather broad strokes to the comedy (and a couple of characters that verge on caricature), ""Tortilla Soup"" ultimately serves up a tasty dish. "
2, Chained for Life is a fine film about how disability is misappropriated.
0," For a vulgar American comedy, this is refreshingly low-key and generous. I admired its intentions without finding it all that funny."
2, may be the most innovative film of the early talkie era.
2," Muse is the scariest of villains, someone with no other options and nothing to lose."
0," The measured mise-en-scène is fine for the boyhood scenes. Character-building alternates with brief bursts of image music, such as the kite-flying contest that fills the Kabul sky with darting, colourful fabric-birds."
0," Aggressively vulgar while straining to be outrageous, it's like one of those rehearsal-dinner toasts remembered for all the wrong reasons."
0," Downsizing never quite goes where you think it's going, and normally, I'd say that's a plus. But confounding expectations only goes so far. You still have to get to a place worth getting to."
2," I Love You, Man is a fun, charming comedy with the casual profanity of a bunch of dudes, but not a deep reliance on gross-out humor or sexcapades."
2," The same whip-smart, intellectual ear for dialogue that made Michael Clayton such an immensely interesting film is back in Duplicity."
2," Salles travels a road paved with a youthful hunger for experience. Like Guevara, he wants us to keep our eyes wide open, to let the world work on us."
0," Like the 20-foot-tall ballerina holograms pirouetting through its decrepit Los Angeles streets, ""Blade Runner 2049"" is hauntingly beautiful, technologically stunning and low on substance."
2, It's a Force to be reckoned with.
2," Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas suits the genre well, and suggests there is an alternative to simply running the sprockets off old holiday perennials."
2, An amazing audio-visual experience.
0," If the people who worked on Baywatch were not sickened, they should have been."
0," Inexplicably, there are people who still haven't had enough of these movies. The first was a nifty novelty. Now the appeal has worn threadbare."
0," The actors strike the right tragi-comic tone, but the ending is such an ill-judged bummer that it's hard not to feel like the whole thing was a waste of time."
2," Thanks to Contagion, I used a paper towel to open a bathroom door the other day and now I'm washing my hands more often. One of the scariest movies in years!"
2," An artful and entertaining gem that is at turns whimsical and thoughtful, humorous and heartfelt, silly and sweet -- and an artistic masterpiece, to boot."
2," Eye In The Sky is sporadically sentimental, unrealistic, and overburdened with intrusive soundtrack music. But it gets you in, and it's suspenseful, claustrophobic, and a fairly unusual take on the counter-terrorism sub-genre."
0, If only it all held together better and didn't feel so obvious and cliché.
2," The first hour of James Lapine's adaptation is so wholesomely fulfilling. When the story takes a sudden, yet awkward shift into ""serious"" and more adult territory, this Disney produced spectacle struggles to find its footing."
0," I much prefer the flamboyant badness of the '94 flick to the attractive, even-keeled mediocrity of this one. Jean-Claude Van Damme's stock just rose considerably."
0," Working from a screenplay by William Monahan, Scott takes rusty '80s clichés from the days when we were playing nuclear chicken with Russia and retrofits them to the post-9/22 world. He exposes how weary those old spy tropes really are."
0," An Education's Lone Sherfig directs, but Powell & Pressburger this ain't."
2," ... the crew dynamic glosses over plenty of story shortcomings... if you enjoyed the first Abrams Star Trek and felt the sequel came up short, this is the best of the three... "
2," Stallone's third-wind career isn't damaged while Schwarzenegger's comeback is certainly helped, playing burly second banana to a cagey ape, the George Kennedy for Cool Hand Sly."
0," Jersey Boys features brilliant art direction but frustrates in equal measure by straddling too many decades, with the scant emotions of an off-set death clearly defining the problem."
2," The film captures the beautiful spirit and the raw energy of Larson's play, and it respects the wonderful, gorgeous, life-affirming music."
0," This mildly racist, tonally bizarre farce fails miserably to make the best of either actor."
0," Once again, Sedgwick is being remembered less for who she was than who she knew."
2," This is not a saccharine, Marley & Me-type tale, but a wrenchingly ordinary story, emotionally manipulative in its own way -- I know my heart was in my throat -- about poverty in the land of plenty."
2," El Cantante is a special film, one that refuses to package a person's life into a comfortably familiar genre."
0," This barely even qualifies as a movie. It's an easily digested piece of commercial product, not unlike a loaf of bread or those pantyhose that come in an egg."
2," Most romantic comedies are content to wade completely into the Moronic Fantasy pool, but The Break-Up earns some extra credit for actually mining a topic that ""normal Joe & Jane"" might actually be able to recognize."
2," Now this isn't the most violent film I've ever seen, but it is certainly one of the only films in which the infliction of violence (gut-churning violence) brings people together. And to that I say ... finally!"
0," The ingredients are there, but loose ends restrict Shivaay from becoming a smooth ride."
2," While this film is a bit weaker, and a lot darker, than the first, it does have a strong story, interesting characters and great digital animation."
0, A sleepy retread of a tired formula that even Atkinson's skill at slapstick tomfoolery can't salvage.
0, ... all the window dressing in the world isn't enough to hide the fact that this misbegotten load of old tosh really doesn't add up to a coherent or credible yarn. Avoid.
2," Despicable Me 3 doubles down on Steve Carell's silly way with words, a smart idea after too much Minions gibberish spoiled part 2. They're still here, in smaller doses and somewhat funnier for it."
0," A handsomely mounted but frustratingly mannered period drama that, in addition to its many other problems, ends just when things appear to be getting really interesting."
0," There's nothing about the film's workmanlike, achingly conventional direction that says 'Fred Durst.' Thank God"
0," The only thing Zemeckis could have done to make Flight more of a chore to sit through beyond its stunning opening sequence, have a kid kick your seat-back for the protracted remainder of the flick."
0," It's clearly a labor of love and no doubt true to some regional ways and attitudes. But jeez, it's self-parodic, and all the more so for taking place in some uncharted corner of Dixie where nobody has the slightest sense of humor."
0," If I sat down and watched Dumb and Dumber for a fourth time, I would certainly laugh at it more often than I laughed at this amiable-but-unnecessary sequel."
0, The ideas here don't breathe. They simply take us from one plot point to the next.
2," George Lucas's science fiction adventure is an exhilarating update of Flash Gordon, very much in the same half-jokey, half-earnest mood, but backed by special effects that, for once, really work and are intelligently integrated with the story."
0," A slavishly literal remake of the satanic-horror standby that elicits laughter, sleep and occasional eye-popped shock but drums up scant real terror."
2," While not all of its scares work perfectly, it's a damn fine piece of found footage horror. It also has a creepy clown that puts Pennywise to shame."
2," The intelligently observed and staggeringly beautiful Italian foreign-language Oscar nominee is about life, death and the search for the things that give meaning to both."
2," Sully won't just please crowds and evoke tears but, in an angry, ugly time in our national history, it should also resonate deeply with many."
2," The film has something for everyone. On the one hand it works very well as a simple scary movie, but on the other it is also a refreshingly thoughtful and masterfully-crafted ghost story."
0, It's an incredibly thin premise that's clumsily (and infuriatingly) stretched out to fill an often interminable 228 minute (!) running time...
2, Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell will always strike a chord with those directly affected by bodily displacement.
0," Evening, despite its fine source material and roster of formidable talent, lurches clumsily across two very long, disconnected hours, reducing Minot's, sprawling, ethereal story to a pop psych nugget about embracing life as it comes."
0, captures the look and feel of Johannes Vermeer's 27th century masterpieces ... but the plot languishes on the screen about as long as it takes Vermeer's oils to dry.
2, Willis' working-class hero gives the mayhem spunky soul and the human touch.
2," Would I recommend Gone in 60 Seconds? Sure. But like while you're doing something else...There are some fun scenes. But, there is also a super cringey running gag."
0," It ain't scary, folks."
2," The film is amiable and pleasant, though the denouement unravels rather too quickly."
0, It's a joyless plunge into gunfire that doesn't even know how to draw blood.
0, Rooney Mara in the title role and Joaquin Phoenix as a frankly rather scary Jesus both do a lot of meaningful staring. 
2," Arditi and Azema stand out in this powerhouse ensemble and share one of its loveliest and saddest moments, gently holding hands in the snow."
2," [The Handmaiden is] gorgeously shot and composed, audacious, and full of witty visual asides. "
2, Jarecki's deft organization of the factual material provides the momentum for a never-flagging exposition of the complexities of the Friedman case
0," What value is there in telling this story now, and in this way?"""
0, Formulaic foodie flick...
0," Director Sher shows no special affinity for comic pacing or enlivening dialogue scenes, so the movie just plods from scene to scene, building no momentum."
0," The characters are sometimes too fearless and too stoic, so the movie feels boring and slow. [full review in Spanish]"
0," It should be retitled; 'Sidonie, Marie Antoinette's just not that into you.' "
0," The most groan-worthy Bay moment comes early on when Megan Fox's journalist, April O'Neal, manages to find some reasoning to dress up like a nerd girl in a porn skit and a school girl with a hiked-up kilt--all in one scene."
2," King Arthur: Legend of the Sword could have been one thing or the other -- one entertaining, one stock standard -- but it settles on an unhappy medium that is never tonally consistent."
2," It's pretty hokey but likable, and the fantasy ""last supper"" scene is tear-jerking stuff."
0," I would tell you to go out and see it for yourself, but you might take that as a recommendation rather than a plea for corroboration. Did I really see what I thought I saw?"
0, Why is The Brave One so much less satisfying than Death Wish?
2, It still stands as a timeless meditation on war and its effects.
2," While over-stylized at times, Eighth Grade manages to reveal constant social frustrations young people experience during this potentially unnerving time in life. "
2, It's not as good as Superman II and certainly nowhere near as good as the comic book; but it's good enough to raise hopes for the sequel.
0," Ruby Sparks is a good little cute 'n' clever (dare I call it... quirky?) movie, and it's possible that the degree to which I'm frustrated with it is solely due to the fact that I hoped for something different, something more."
2," They don't get below the skin, per say, but it's a hell of a ride watching it...one of the more impressive performances I've seen on celluloid."
2," White God is something bold and experimental. Beautiful and brutal, and even with its shortcomings and derivative leanings, it's a unique experience."
0, This latest recycling of foreign-grown frights shows less interest in horror than in healing.
0," Death, taxes, Gerard Butler. Wish them away all you like: still they befall us."
0," While the parts are quite good, the sum is pretty pedestrian."
0, Perhaps someday French auteurists will be able to figure out how Bad News Bears fits into the cinematic oeuvre of Richard Linklater.
0, It's admirable that the film's taking its subject seriously; it's just not enough.
0," A gruelling gimmick thriller, pitched at dead-eyed graduates of the Matthew Vaughn school of cinematic sociopathy."
0," I mean, if you were writing a script for a movie starring yourself, wouldn't you also write yourself a bunch of sex scenes too?"
0," The Brothers Grimsby doesn't do much to satirize the spy genre, instead using its flimsy plot mostly as a scaffolding for a barrage of jokes. "
2, It's all marvellously acted and gorgeous to look at.
0," The problem is, when facing down Love's and Cobain's outsize, junked-up personalities, Grant seems a total naïf."
0," While people who love Arcade Fire might get a kick out of the concert footage, they might just as easily be frustrated by the band's willing aloofness."
0, The Lone Ranger is too often as vast and empty as Utah's Monument Valley. Only the film's wide stretches aren't awe-inspiring so much as much as tiring.
2, An assured and thoughtful debut.
2," With no gimmicks and a lot of patience, this is one of the most disturbing films of the year. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Boring and bedraggled.
0," The moral of this failed fable might best be summed up as, ""Dude, get some earplugs."""
2, We Are Still Here is the first incredibly scary and pure horror film of 2025.
2," [A] compelling story, aided by wonderful performances from Spall, Weisz and Tom Wilkinson."
2," A borderline anticlimactic end doesn't quite deliver on the impressive constructions of My Cousin Rachel's first two acts, but a stirring epilogue provides an effective capstone to this nuanced thriller."
0," Usher doesn't have the forceful, charismatic presence needed to convince as the ringleader of a group of such headstrong individuals."
0," While packed with effects and action, without the attention to story and emotional investment present in such films as The Dark Knight and Ironman, Wolverine ultimately doesn't rise above its comic-book roots."
0," Another generic Jason Statham action movie with cheap violence, poor performances, and a waste of your time."
2, It's up there with some of the best teen movies of the 80s as pure pleasure that will make you feel 27 again. Brilliantly uplifting and heart warming stuff.
0, The real pity is that the film could have made its points without being so insufferably preachy and ponderous.
0," At only 77 minutes, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo is about 76 minutes too long."
2," Short on nuance but long on passion, Chicago 20 recreates the gradual boil-over from peaceful gathering to chaos by augmenting ample, close-range footage with the kind of sonic boom that seldom accompanies political documentaries."
2," Though the story is predictable, Cronenberg's cool touch keeps it from degenerating into tired action-movie clichés."
0, An aimless mess. But at least the mess is sexy and exciting.
0," Features moments so light, they alone could lift the economy."
2," Great Stephen King movie. Some true scares, lots of gore, and a hint of morality. Are you responsible for the reanimated dead?"
0," I haven't the first clue, and I'm pretty sure neither do the filmmakers because, if they did, you'd think they'd have realized early on the meat and bones of their adventure were made out of nothing but burning ashes."
2, This is definitely worth a bargain matinee.
2," [It] builds out such an unusual premise that it risks devolving into quirky inanity, but Abbasi grounds the narrative in an emotional foundation even as it flies off the rails."
0," Payne's heart might have been in the right place with this one, but the execution feels flippant at best."
2, Chu's film brings the wealth porn of Dallas and Dynasty back with a bang.
0," Although Ron Howard and Tom Hanks have collaborated successfully before, this adaptation of Dan Brown's thriller is frenzied and inane, fumbling the franchise."
2," The Grinch is still about kindness and learning to go beyond material goods to find happiness, and isn't that what the holiday season is all about? Plus kids are going to love it."
0, The movie's strategy is to smear all its characters with a taint of corruption; it turns New York into a city so broken that no character is without moral culpability.
2, Drillbit more than succeeds as a superior screwball comedy.
0," Ultimately feels rather scattershot and disjointed, perhaps quite simply because it lacks the sheer left-field originality of the original..."
2," We all need a little mindless entertainment every now and then, and Rampage certainly fits the bill."
0, He's brilliant! He's funny! He's a genius! He's a total lothario! This is seriously the only thing anyone says for the entire convulsing 2 2/2 hours.
2," Funny, emotional and affecting."
0, This one isn't nearly as gut-wrenchingly awful as the first one -- the animation is better. But it's still so bad it hurts.
0," It's not compelling; in fact, there are times when it's not especially interesting."
2," The kvetches of regulars at a cheery Beirut beauty salon couldn't be more familiar -- and that's the slender charm of Caramel, a Lebanese variation on sweetly soapy dramas about Women Who Bond With Wet Hair."
2," Within its narrow field of vision, the film does bore deep, right through the more obvious strata to the farther, rarer questions seldom asked regarding our relationship to memory - not just what we remember and why, but who we are remembering for."
0, Less like a neighborhood watch than it is a lesser Bowery Boys scenario -- only here staffed by the hormonal Hardy Boys from hell.
0," The many nods to ""Jurassic Park"" will more than likely fly over the heads of the film's target audience while hitting adults over their noggins and the Apple/Google-like Live Corp with its Steve Jobs inspired CEO skirts over parody rather than mining it."
2, The lasting takeaway from the film is how much there is to this man.
0," After listening to this steady anti-Bush drumbeat for the past several months, even the most devout progressives may start to feel as if they've heard much of this sermon a hundred times before."
2," Free Fire may be far from the best movie of the year, but you are guaranteed to have one of your most fun times at the movies when checking out Wheatley's latest."
2, Strange ensemble noir comedy chase flick.
2," [2049] is long, laborious (in a good way) and lovingly detailed. It's also visually and aurally spectacular."
2, Exciting and entertaining...and be patient through the long end credits for a revealing epilogue as the salty seafarers sail on.
2, An enjoyably twisty little throat-grabber.
2," Basically Boardwalk Empire if it had starred Ben Affleck from The Town. It's not a good movie, but it's a fun bad one. "
2, Annoyingly entertaining.
2," Put this on your playlist, if only for an hour or two."
0," Half crinoline romance, half crusty military-history lesson."
0," The film represented an important opportunity to give more strength to the prequel that had been a surprise, but ends up wasting it. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Public Enemies is, at its core, a fascinating portrait of criminal narcissism."
0, The characters here are such idiots that you can't wait to see them get chewed up.
0, ... an overwrought and muddled mess with little redemptive value.
0, The absolutely most enthusiastic thing I can say about Our Idiot Brother is that I didn't mind sitting through it.
0," Natural beauty compensates greatly, but not completely, for stilted cinematography that forces an awkward perspective on the viewer."
2," In telling Paige's life story, Stephen Merchant, Florence Pugh, Dwayne Johnson, and WWE have accomplished something remarkable, but also something that fits the very core of wrestling; it's for everyone"
0, Tarantino's made a great movie but an underwhelming film.
0," Pierre is such a weasel, Katya is such a narcissist and the outcome seems so pre-determined, it's hard to care whose belt gets the notch. The adroit performances of Buscemi and Miller almost make it matter."
2," Pixar's mantra has always been story first, and they've managed to salvage every one of their troubled productions, but in the case of The Good Dinosaur you can definitely feel the machinery straining to pull it off one more time."
2," Anomalisa is a transfixing, thoughtful, and touching film that goes deep into the viewer's psyche and stirs up emotions of introspective thought."
2, Portman does a tremendous job balancing an accurate impersonation of Mrs. Kennedy's unique voice and mannerisms with a performance that is genuine and fresh. 
2," We cheer for all of these kids, because it is so easy to remember the pain of getting something wrong in front of the whole class."
0," With this hapless entry, even fans of the series will have their allegiance tested."
2," Flushed Away, the new feature from Aardman Animations, revels in its British-ness -- it's full of bone-dry wit, football references, and ribs on the French -- and I was hooked from the first shot of Tower Bridge."
2," The scenes move with such relentless energy and smashing special-effects extravagance that Die Hard turns out to be everything action-genre fans, and Bruce Willis's relieved investors, might have hoped for."
0, This film biggest problem? No laughs.
2," A near-great Western, weakened only by overt revisionism."
2," For all its anger and impressive visuals, The Shelter is a meditative piece about moving from confusion to the acceptance of something perhaps cannot be fully understood. "
2," Logan is a sign that it's possible to make mature films with superheroes, with themes of real emotional resonance. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Sigh. Magic has not struck twice for this franchise.
0," Has the moral overtones of an EM Forster story, but is curiously lacking in emotional force."
2," While the attractive performers and the action set pieces, including fights inside a sand tornado and around a spider's web of razor wire, are enough to carry you through the film, ""Flying Swords"" is a bit of a letdown ..."
2, One of the year's most charming and sly works -- as well as perhaps the saddest film in the filmmaker's entire oeuvre.
0," ""Look Away"" mostly fails as a ""killer teen"" movie. The pace is too slow, and the mood too somber."
0," After the fact, story outline can be pieced together, but beyond essential motivation, there also remain a number of unintentional loose ends."
2," The details of the story in Bridge of Spies are specific to their time, but the broader conflicts from which they stem remain pertinent."
0, Dark Shadows makes almost no attempt to reward cinema audiences.
0, Everything reminds you of some other movie.
2," The dialogue sparkles, delivered by a cast on top of their game, in a movie that aims for subtlety rather than bravado."
2," So while the endgame is familiar, Incredibles 2 finds a way to be unique in its execution of that template."
2," The animation dazzles. The baby birds are fluffy darlings. The script has its moments, the dance bits are a blast."
2," A film that's at once light, joyful and emotionally devastating, with deeply affecting central performances. A full-hearted romantic masterpiece."
2, ...one of the most exciting and fresh films of the year.
2," Morose, hangdog Noredin, so unconvincing in his colonel's uniform, is a satisfying antihero."
2," This is pleasant, safe entertainment that ought to appeal to kids younger than 20, especially to girls, with its female-empowerment fantasy."
2," Mañas has created such vivid political theater within his film, those unfamiliar with the Spanish art movement may believe they're learning about an actual group."
0," The problem with The Matrix Revolutions comes from writer/director team Larry and Andy Wachowski, whose script sounds as if it were doctored by Ed Wood."
0," The movie is never quite bold enough to point out the contradiction of Muslims and Christians hating one another, even though they both in theory worship the same god."
2, Fascinating strangeness. [Full Review in Spanish]
0, An undercooked piece of pulp fiction that could use another pass through the oven.
0," Loud, long and utterly incomprehensible, 'Revenge of the Fallen' is an exquisitely painful experience that pummels the senses as it confounds the intellect."
2," This is a film that finds certain purity in disillusionment and freedom in failure. Which may not be sweet, but it is tasty."
2," The grand tradition of city symphonies, films tailored to celebrate the mood and feeling of their urban settings, lives on here."
0," It's an unimaginative, mean-spirited affair that makes you hate yourself for laughing at it, and it's so devoid of anything close to wit, subtlety or sophistication."
2," Filmworker is a portrait of an unsung hero, a revealing look at how Kubrick's films were made and a psychological sketch of a would-be Da Vinci determined to keep dusting and polishing someone else's Sistine Chapel."
0," The Prince & Me has the materials to be a heartwarming mass-market love story, but it doesn't assemble them convincingly."
0," Ultimately, the movie deteriorates into a long commercial for the home-game version of itself."
2," Denis Villeneuve is, unquestionably, one of the most exciting directors working today."
2, Dark Shadows may be overcrowded in characters and story but it's never less than entertainingly weird.
2, This documentary captures what may be the last of Antonio Barrera's bullfighting days at a time when the sport itself seems about to fade into history.
2," Like Goodfellas without the visual fizz, or Scarface played straight, this is, quite simply, one of the greatest prison films ever made."
0," It might look good but it's an anachronism that totally loses its way in the desert. Given the director's enthusiasm, Black Gold should have sparkled."
0," As muted and still as a Vermeer painting, Girl With a Pearl Earring has atmosphere to burn and a near-total action vacuum."
0," Entirely hollow, poorly put together, and will require an audience on its level of stupidity to survive. Don't be one of its supporters."
0," This banal horror retread involves a couple of critters flailing inside a sticky trap for what is, in effect, the big-screen equivalent of a roach motel."
0," While the movie itself is about as subtle as a brick to the head, the actress brings vulnerability and tenderness to her role, and generates empathy through her performance."
0," American Ultra should have activated its comic instincts, not its action ones."
0, Sandra Bullock turns in an excruciatingly kooky performance in this ill-conceived stalker romance.
2," It's an unusual but effective mix of outrageousness and sincerity, in which the four anxious revelers function both as broad caricatures and as real, complex human beings."
2," An amusing, touching and subtly transportive film set in a place you'll probably never get to visit."
2," Despite this apparent formalism through the majority of the film, He Got Game still contains a strong emotional power near the climax, when Lee finally lets up on the effects."
2, A deft balance of the pessimistic and the playful
0," If [director Gabriele] Muccino [who directed Will Smith in the Pursuit of Happyness] had a sense of humor, he would have named Seven Pounds The Pursuit of Unhappyness."
2," Violence and insults are sustained and, at times, effective. [Full Review in Spanish] "
2," While elegantly shot, the film becomes little more than a two-hour character study, showcasing the depths of Gere's talent."
0, Something old is new again
0, All we learn is that this happened and then this and then this -- the movie is like a multimillion-dollar grade-school play.
2," We've grown so used to lowest-common-denominator blockbuster cinema that it's almost shocking to watch a big science fiction movie, featuring these kinds of stars, swinging for the fences in this way."
0, This has all the ingredients for a top-notch thriller except one -- a thrill.
2," This movie is action, horror, and comedy by way of Hogwarts, and it's frightfully fun. Occasionally scary, and even scarier for how often the film works."
0," Fitfully entertaining but also curiously old fashioned, this is a film that only really sparks into life when the crowds are baying for blood and the chariots are in action. Apart from that, it seems like The Life Of Brian without the jokes."
0, Perky but spineless.
2, One of those rare films where just about every last thing about it falls magically into place.
0," Rolling to You arrives at a bad time. It laughs at the handicapped, women and even the spectator. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," The best moments come when the movie embraces the slanderous metafiction skewering the genre its parodying, but it's hard not to feel that sooner or later the plotline sags and becomes the very thing it's supposed to be savaging."
0," No amount of Zombie Rules can explain a movie like this, or the recent filmmaker fascination with a creaky old genre."
2," Much as he did in Brick, Johnson creates a carefully drawn world in Looper that exists by its own particular set of rules."
0," There's a need for redemption here, to be certain, and it has nothing to do with the narrative."
2," Requiem isn't a horror movie so much as a thwarted coming-of-age story, like Carrie without the bloody reckoning."
0, Distinctly earthbound...neither bad enough to make you furious nor good enough to be memorable.
2," This perfectly paced, thoughtfully written, and impeccably acted masterpiece is a gourmet meal from one of American cinema's master chefs."
0," Are women desperate or just desperately stupid? This is the misogynist question at the core of He's Just Not That Into You, a women-bashing tract disguised as a chick flick."
2," The Post is an important film spotlighting the necessity of a free press to keep our government in check, but more importantly, spotlights a person...a woman willing to risk everything for the greater good of the nation."
2," A phenomenal popcorn movie that eclipses the original in several respects, but inevitably owes a huge debt to the powerful imagery and innovation of the 2930s landmark."
2," Barbershop: The Next Cut is very good. It tries many ambitious things, and for the most part, succeeds. That's a rarity, indeed."
0," For those who indulge in the ""so bad its good"" type of film-watching, The Trough offers enough steady laughs and pockets of incomprehensible decisions to warrant an ironic watch."
2," After a week of shameful anti-immigrant rhetoric, Brooklyn is the big-hearted bear hug of a movie a lot of folks could use."
2," Unfolding in real time, Money Monster hints at being a more taut, topical thriller than it turns out to be. While always compulsively watchable, and often surprisingly funny, it loses some of its steam once it becomes clear where it's going."
0," Such a beautiful movie -- and so cold, too."
0," Coogan and Brydon ... begin to grate, and come off as obnoxious, both to themselves and to the patrons around them, who hopefully got comped for their meals."
2, What you get with When in Rome is a surprisingly good romantic comedy.
2," Tim Burton's ""reinvention"" of '68 sci-fi classic boasts awesome makeup and design -- and awful writing."
2," No es una película ""agradable"" ni ""entretenida""; es una película incómoda y cerebral apenas perturbada por pequeñas alteraciones en sus personajes. Como las de George Smiley, en la brillante composición de Gary Oldman."
2," Offers tolerable comedy, but in less surprising or demanding ways than Coen fans might expect."
0," This movie is certainly an ideal vehicle for Natalie Portman to show off her acting, singing and dancing talents, but beyond that, it doesn't seem to amount to much. The sum of its parts seem to add up to less of a whole than it should."
2," In all its frustrations, this might well be the first great film on the Iraq War."
2," Countless backstage stories, culled mostly from interviews and archival footage, are assembled in Six by Sondheim into the story of a life - and a life's work."
2, Recognize J.C. Chandor as one of the most exciting writers and directors working today - after all of three films.
0," Essentially the picture is one tease after another, misdirecting as fast as it can and amounting to the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" vacuousness of mid-period M. Night Shyamalan. "
0," These people are mostly meat-and-potatoes, what-you-see-is-what-you-get, and Payne and screenwriter Bob Nelson frequently portray their Midwestern brethren with disdain and a lack of compassion."
2," This unique, super-smart and berserkly imaginative French animated entry is a real achievement in the world of animation."
0," While Alice is obviously meant to be inscrutable, the film itself has trouble keeping up with all the myriad changes to her stories and moods, with the doggedly external perspective on her actions increasingly hindering empathy and engagement."
2," A good movie, but definitely not for everyone, as much like the marines starring in this show, most of your time watching the film is spent waiting for ""something"" to happen."
2," The film cannot help but be described as colorful just based on the visualizations of White's work alone, but his persona matches his creations as he tries to prove that art does not have to be uber-serious and can just be fun."
0," Do anything: rob a petrol station, superglue your eyelids together, chew on broken glass, just avoid at all costs."
2, Enough action to entertain and enough Tolkien to satisfy. 
0," Nocturnal Animals matches Tom Ford's A Single Man in terms of its visual vibrancy and solid performances, but it has opted to replace its beating heart with a leaden paperweight."
2," The easy gag about the 296-minute ""Winter Sleep"" is that it's so good it makes 3?2/2 hours feel like two, but that's no joke."
2," Scratches your monster-movie itch without ever once providing an injection of unpredictability or eccentricity. It lacks neither fun nor polish, but it has the square tidiness of a compartmentalized fast-food meal."
2, It vainly tries to flash its escapist fun teeth with the usual implausible Bond plot.
2," Would I even like this movie if they hadn't sent me this coffee mug? I should have given the coffee mug to Goodwill. But I can't be bought by a coffee mug, can I?"
0," A preening, superficial film that expects you to appreciate its smart concept without noticing the stupid execution."
2," Smarter, creepier, and better than expected."
2, aided immeasurably by enjoying the little touches and all but ignoring the big picture.
2," Mostly delightful. It can give you the foreboding you feel when encountering the word ""artisanal,"" but otherwise this nested story of Central European skullduggery seems to have more of a spine than anything he's made since Fantastic Mr. Fox. "
0," Had there been a little more fun here, it would have been a great nostalgic blast."
0, It certainly delivers as a loving homage to two of our favorite monsters and their respective super-duper powers.
2," Birdman is equal parts funny, crazy, manic, beautiful, honest, and heartfelt. "
2, This final installment is both too much of a good thing and too little.
2, Charlize Theron shines but Atomic Blonde needed more highlights.
2," The cat came back. Good thing, too."
0," Surprisingly, this thriller from director Roger Donaldson isn't half bad, due in large part to its star Pierce Brosnan, who returns to the action genre after far too long an absence. "
2," Who is ""Our Man""? What did he do in life? Why was he out there? It doesn't matter. All that matters is this moment, and the next moment, and the moment after that."
0," Despite the appeal of its co-stars, this romantic comedy is undermined by over-the-top performances from some of its actors as well as the movie's frantic pace."
0," To get to those shots of Stone's chest and thighs, however, the audience has to wait through a two-hour story that's so tedious that the audience may walk out before Stone eventually liberates herself from her clothing."
0," Because it's Claire Foy's turn, The Girl in the Spider's Web cannot honestly be called a colossal waste of time. It's merely a moderate waste."
0, Slowness doesn't necessarily equal beauty or power or profundity.
2," ""Broken Flowers"" is a time capsule contemplation of an American generational zeitgeist similar to that in John Sayles' terrific ""The Return Of The Secaucus Seven."""
0," Sentimental hogwash, but it's hogwash with an insidious power."
0," If Gangs of New York was a musical, you'd leave the theater humming the sets."
2," [A] surprisingly tender, funny movie from John Carpenter, a man otherwise known for his intense horror/genre flicks. It may be the best sci-fi/romance hybrid ever made. "
2, A lovely little film which amounts to much more than its director perhaps intended it to.
2," [A] genre deconstruction that is somehow smarter than it's given credit for while also not being as smart as it believes itself to be...an uneven, yet ultimately satisfying ending."
0, It's pretty silly.
0, This blade is much too dull.
0," Equally as stupid as the original, but it runs about 30 minutes shorter, which is nice."
2," You want a feel-good movie, you don't have to rely on fiction to conjure it; the thoroughly wired reality of Twinsters will leave you grinning."
0, Fails to come close to being a solid recommendation due to the convoluted plot and inconsistency of tones.
2," Definitely, Maybe, which was written and directed by Adam Brooks, has charm and spirit."
0," It's all big, distant, unfathomable wreckage - shattering skyscrapers and rippling cityscapes - with no sense of the human cost"
0, About the best thing I can say about Juwanna Mann is that it's not dreadful.
0, This is a franchise with lead weights tied around its ankles.
2, An unusual and intriguing film full of philosophy and social theories.
0, [Davis] doesn't seem to possess the inner life that an artist has to bring to the surface.
0, ..like watching some stranger's home videos of his kid...a cinematic indulgence which only its makers and participants could love.
2," Despite the set-up, the tone is lightweight seriocomic and everybody gets a resolution for their problems one way or another."
0, The heavy-handedness -- the strip-search begins with the loud thwack of rubber gloves -- reduces Hamid's characters to talking points. 
0, There's certainly a good film to be made about Srila Prabhupada and the spiritual movement he founded that became an international sensation starting in the mid-2960s. But John Griesser's documentary isn't it.
0, Cotillard's lip-synching of her character singing didn't do it for me.
2," A crass, foul-mouthed, mostly hilarious, surprisingly sentimental bromance about a grown boy named John and his teddy bear."
0," The effect of seeing that character's (Doss) unwavering, steadfast faith instead of the inner struggles it must have taken to get to that point misses a big opportunity for teaching and discussion."
2," While the film lacks the visual imagination of THOR or the period feel of CAPTAIN AMERICA, it has more of a sense of structures on a huge scale being blown up by even bigger explosions."
0," Unfortunately, the drama is nil, and the laughs come thick and fast."
0," Making concessions at every turn to the youth-horror market, the film slashes the ages of its protagonists by some 25 years, and its IQ follows suit."
0," Being strictly true isn't even the point: being convincingly or interestingly so, or preferably both, might have elevated this thing above drab homework."
2," Like the man himself, compelling and confounding in equal measure."
0," The spectacle of King churning them out, churning them out, churning them out is, unfortunately, so much more vivid than anything he writes."
0," Painfully dull, excruciatingly unfunny and mind-numbingly frustrating, there's a multitude of reasons why you'll be left asking, ""Why did I even bother?"""
2," While there are plenty of standard horror-film tropes, Ghost Stories is also full of originality. It is an ingeniously crafted and properly scary film."
0," The Love Guru just feels lazy, filling time with jokes about Celine Dion, Oprah Winfrey, Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, Myers and Kanye West's Katrina telethon appearance -- essentially, inside jokes for everyone in the world with cable."
2," The film contains Gandolfini's final lead role, but his performance is cherishably un-final: easy, open and insisting on nothing, it's the work of a man who is just getting started."
0, A workmanlike but unavoidably predictable yarn about the perils of college fraternity hazing.
0," The tsunami comes to life more vividly than the characters, though Watts and young Holland, as her son, deliver strong performances."
2," Ducournau's lurid, vivid film is visually striking, full of images that will shock you while others will lull you with a hypnotic beauty."
0," There's always a dark strand beneath the surface that Silva seems anxious to explore, but usually he weaves it in better than he does in Nasty Baby."
0," Though Haggis has crafted an ambitious tale, it is way too complicated and convoluted."
2," The rarest of cinematic rarities -- a schmaltz-free feelgooder which doesn't just make you feel good, but reminds you that true love can exist and that beauty can be found in even the most seemingly mundane of places."
0," Despite an abundance of nude male torsos, New Moon hasn't enough swoony romance for its female demo, action thrills or cleverness anywhere in the production, dragging on eternally like its vamp undead."
0, Teen comedies like Easy A invoke the John Hughes canon at their own peril
2, Instead of a classic along the lines of As Good as It Gets; Spanglish is merely a pleasant diversion. Sandler's surprise turn makes it worth a viewing.

2," Despite the predictability of the script, I got a little misty at the end."
2," It's a film to admire, but not an easy one to fall in love with."
2," Just as fun, sexy, and label heavy as the series."
0," throws all logic out the window, raises the gore quotient and offers more offensive racial stereotypes than any WB or UPN sitcom."
2," As a late-summer action romp, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is easy-peasy viewing. It's fast, it's fun, and it's brimming with attitude."
0," There's nothing wrong with being uplifting, but something less predictable would have been refreshing."
0, Hats off to Viggo Mortensen. The actor pulls off playing identical twins in this Argentinian thriller - which never quite lives up to his talents.
2," [A] quiet, immersive true-crime mystery doc ..."
0, A handful of effectively scary moments spread out over 234 minutes of a fairly dull haunted-house story.
0," This mash-up makes for a curious movie, one both beholden to its many sources of inspiration, and uncertain of how to use them to pave its way forward."
0," It doesn't take itself as seriously as it should, and undercuts a final act that should have and so could have packed a mighty emotional wallop."
0, The serious Catholic themes that made the original film genuinely disturbing have been flattened out into a cartoonish backstory pitting Merrin against Nazi storm troopers.
0, The film falls short when it comes to evoking the loneliness of being surrounded by all that space.
0, This Day has a big special effects budget but has little sense and even less soul.
2," Though scenes occasionally start to feel static, Jonze usually finds entertaining ways to keep the film's tricky conceit going."
0," Jean is such a monster, and John such a put-upon sweetheart, that Glassland offers little more than undiluted bathos for over an hour."
2," Truth, in this case, really does turn out to be stranger than fiction - and more troubling and fascinating to boot. "
0," If mean words from a critic were so damaging to the artist, I would have killed Rob Schneider years ago."
0," This is an ugly, angry picture."
0," Like a Hannah Montana movie, Hope Springs argues there are no romantic ills that a walk on the beach and a few pop songs on the soundtrack can't cure."
0, It's hard to take it as anything but unintended camp.
0," The problem is that since all these kids are so blank, only Stillman, as the narrative voice, is in on his many jokes."
2," A delightful, resonant film, a great advertisement for Scherfig's self-effacing, but socially probing, directorial style, and a beguiling introduction to Mulligan."
0," The Vow flirts with several interesting themes, but too easily this romantic drama sticks to a formulaic narrative that loudly preaches love conquers all."
2," Beautiful movie beautifully done. This is stunning and MUST be seen on the big screen and not your small TV. In fact, the bigger the screen, the better and 3D if possible."
2," It gives the audience a seriocomic rush. The filmmakers never figure out a full and satisfying ending for a real-life story that culminates in a paralyzing injustice. But if the climactic shocks are just sketched in, the others are vivid and alive. "
2," ""Somewhere"" is an undeniably minor film. But if you""re willing to be indulgent, you""ll find surprising pleasures hidden within."
0," Has a slick, anonymous style that seems designed to smooth out anything potentially distinctive or memorable."
2," Neal Purvis and Robert Wade mix a relevant story with clever tributes to franchise films. Their robust throwback obviously ensures Bond will survive on screen way beyond ""Another Day."""
2," There aren't any easy answers, and devotees of Errol Morris should know that going in."
0, All style. No soul.
2," Courtenay and Rampling are at the top of their game throughout, drawing us into their hopes and fears even as we watch them from a distance."
0," Kate Winslet is the reason to see the sombre, understated, literary The Reader, which has touching moments but never delivers on its early promise."
0," The Banger Sisters occasionally exhibit a raw sense of sexuality that compliments the alluring maturity of bombastic babes Sarandon and Hawn. Still, these ravishing relics just couldn't pull off a noteworthy tune to the same old song and dance"
2," Logan would absolutely deserve a Best Picture Oscar nomination, even more than Christopher Nolan's hailed yet arguably snubbed Batman masterpiece The Dark Knight."
0," Despite the subject, the script is flat. Despite using the real locations, the production looked cheesy. Finally, the decision to strip Mark David Chapman (John Lennon's killer) of any humanity makes the narrative decidedly one note."
0," Even by the standard of a fourth-in-a-series summer blockbuster, Wolverine is remarkably lame."
2," Dank with greenish tiled interiors and an unshakable sense of dread, this lovably icky horror film mounts a sumptuous, immersive universe, the kind that big-budgeted Hollywood rarely seems imaginative enough to try."
0," There are some lessons learned and fun to be had throughout Blockers' high jinks, misunderstandings, wieners, and kids having access to far doper prom partying than I ever did, but none of it really lands."
2," Cold Pursuit is probably too satisfying to viewers' bloodlust to achieve the full potential impact of its criticisms. In other words, Moland lacks the convictions of Michael Haneke and his Funny Games."
2," David Mamet's play about the wheelings and dealings of real-estate salesmen gets dedicated playing from a splendid cast, but gains nothing by the transfer from stage to screen."
0, It looks like a two-hour Neutrogena commercial.
0," One way to get through the long, agonizing experience of ""Maudie"" is to convince yourself it's a comedy. The spectacle of the actors flailing in a vacuum makes this possible, but intermittently, so the relief comes only in bursts."
0," The concept is strong, the acting fine, and in parts the film is funny and likeable. I like the notion of middle-aged men behaving like little boys in a playground. But the dialogue is all wrong."
0, Rodriguez is underserved in a film that wants to be a superhero movie but ends up an insulting and incompetent B-movie.
2, If it ran five minutes longer it would cross the line from amusing to annoying. But it doesn't.
2," A blistering political satire that may rip the bandage and the scab, as well as a lot of the skin, off a political wound that has barely had time to heal."
0, A Wes Anderson facsimile that only serves to make you treasure the real thing all the more.
0, Rates somewhere between a pink carnation from the boss and the off-label SweetTarts left out in the break room: nothing personal is offered or gained and you really have to work to enjoy it.
2, A documentary memoir about the journey of one of Andy Warhol's pop art creations.
2," Smart, witty and quirky but never in a pretentious or self-satisfied way, (500) Days of Summer is simply a well-crafted romantic comedy."
2," It's like Dead Ringers meets Body Double with a kinky, winking full-frontal Gallic twist."
0, The adulterous lovers' anguished scruples scan like inert masochism.
2," The pacing has improved, even if the story coheres less, and Bell makes a hilarious and malevolent irritant: She's like the quieter white female counterweight to Ice Cube."
0, The whole movie is so nonsensical that it almost seems like a misguided aesthetic choice.
2," Purists may worry that the film strays a little from Kipling's book, but the high production values, exotic locales and a grand sense of adventure ensure that this classic family fantasy film stands the test of time with ease."
0," The story also seems fairly vague and spread across several different narrative threads that never quite add up. No one has a clear motive, including the Predator himself, and this makes for confusing, tensionless viewing."
2, All the surface style is properly wrapped around ideas of substance.
2," With his first film in close to a decade, Glazer has created a captivating nightmare, a heady, haunting experience that demands multiple viewings."
2," It is utterly absorbing film to watch, with Levinson capturing Madoff's emotional journey through most of the events almost totally in close-up, at times strangely impassive, at others just containing that sense of dismay."
2, The visuals are passable. The story's a lot of fun. And the story is what sells the movie.
0," Honestly, the god-awful, no-budget, grade-Z 2959 potboiler Teenagers From Outer Space had more integrity than does this piece of militaristically oppressive, micromanaged tripe."
2," It may not have the shoulders to carry the expectations of a summer blockbuster, but it's a solid action option as a break from the Halloween frights and based-on-a-true-story dramas that will be filling screens until the holiday season kicks in."
2, Do-Deca-Pentathlon showcases the deft way with interpersonal relationships that's making the Duplasses two of our premier chroniclers of just why it is that we can never seem to get along.
2," In Christopher Reeve, the casting department found someone with just the right charisma to pull it off."
2," ""The last thing to age on somebody is their heart"" - says it all."
2," The kids from Glee take to the concert stage in Glee 3D Concert Movie, singing and dancing and smiling to beat the band. "
0, An uninspired thriller offering even the minimally computer-literate viewer few insights into the world of hacktivism.
2," [Gilroy] shows that it's interesting to see how much suspense can be generated when one decides to do the right thing, simply because the forces at large will do everything they can to prevent it."
2," Written, directed and acted with a passion that radiates off the screen, The Normal Heart is drama at its most incendiary, a blunt instrument that is also poetic and profound."
2, Plenty of direction and as much photography. There doesn't appear to be a miss or skip either.
0," Dull, predictable, ugly, filled with bad or lackluster performances, contains objectionable racial material and just generally lacking in anything worthwhile. One of the worst movies of the year."
0," If you're going to call your movie Momentum, it really ought to move."
2, This film is an American dream gone awry.
0," Most of the performances are thoroughly enjoyable, but they are also a long way from delivering what the film promises."
2," Next Friday will eventually be remembered as a disposable farce, but one that leaves a happy memory."
0," An above average comedy, but already somewhat redundant. [Full Review in Spanish] "
2," It starts with thriller clichés and ends in sanctimonious preaching, but in between there are a couple of true things: a portrait of a marriage under stress, and a depiction of the arrogance of power that leaves a sharp after-burn."
0," Is The Perfect Holiday a good film? The answer is: not really, but it isn't terrible."
0, It's really a touching kids movie about youthful imagination and family values. That's not what I wanted!
2," This is a wildly creative film that plays on your heart and your head, stunning in its rich imagery and ambitious in its themes."
2," End of Watch is so inventive, and so anchored by two highly enjoyable performances, that it makes for one of the more singular, if not entirely successful, entries in a genre that often suffers from stale sameness."
0," The only real pleasure is in the performance of young Kylie Rogers, who acts up a storm. And it's always nice to see Fonda, looking fabulous at 77. But this is not a worthy vehicle for any of them."
0," I laughed out loud a couple of times. It's not as funny as it needs to be to make it a must-watch in theaters, but it's not so terrible that you should avoid it at all costs."
2, This savagely authentic film about flawed masculinity is worth seeking out for another viewing if the summer's toothless blockbuster fodder is getting you down.
0," It ultimately succumbs to the bland, sentimental uplift we've come to expect from such outings."
2," As a vehicle for its lead actress, it's satisfactory, but no more."
0, It would've been nice to get to know a few of the men we're meant to care about.
2," While it's an entertaining documentary, audiences may not find the 68-year-old Gordon's trajectory quite as fascinating as Myers appears to."
0, The characters prove nothing more than patchy sketches and the drama simply evaporates.
2, We're left with the simple joys of seeing annoying tube celebs and homophobic religious haters being murdered. That's not enough.
0, White slips the noose around his film's neck with such startling speed it's dead long before I even realized oxygen wasn't getting to its brain.
2," At a time when even niche films are virtually scrubbed clean of any traces of eccentricity, Solondz's downbeat vision of humanity is downright refreshing."
0, A well-crafted yarn that overstays its welcome.
2," If you think you're brave enough, and even if you aren't, Buried demands to be experienced on the big screen in all its suffocating, claustrophobic glory. "
2, Bring earplugs and you'll enjoy an efficient vehicle for Denzel that makes good use of its South African scenery. Espinosa nimbly combines flash with Paul Greengrass-style flair.
2," Mostly, Vives' work is a series of punch lines that feel more like gut punches - a relentless challenge that Winstead handles with seeming ease."
0, A gender/boxy-switch comedy that demonstrates that sometimes a tired old idea is still tired. 
2," It is so good, it might make you cry."
2," The mix of comedy and drama is winning; Costner couldn't be better, and the little girl is a find."
0, neither a dismissible failure nor a cinematic success
2, Bell's revelation is that females (even high-achieving ones) are surprisingly likely to use a voice that suggests they're an ickle-wickle pushover.
0, Sometimes a film just can't live up to all its reputations.
0," It fills the screen with a series of explicative conversations set in offices, hotels, and cars throughout which people don't so much talk to each other as indirectly to the audience."
2, Perhaps the funniest thing about Kill Bill: Volume One is the realization that this ode to ultraviolence and Uma Thurman's feet is probably Quentin Tarantino's most personal film.
0," Despite some gratuitous allusions to Gitmo, the third-rate effects and the two-bit characters make this a summer wipeout."
0, The dirty documentary style of Into the Storm only calls attention to how fake its characters and situations really are.
2," Well, Joe Wright has done it. His ANNA KARENINA is a triumph. "
0, It's a mixture of styles that may have worked well if concentrated on one over another. Instead the subject matter struggles to find a distinct voice.
0," Movies like this don't really establish their characters and draw much of the humor out of their personalities; they go for quick payoffs, easy slapstick and in-jokes based on insults and code words."
2, A unique vision of the American West as place of desolation and ruin on a truly epic scale.
2, Best trip to Grandma's House ever.
0," Yet, for those who remember both the sheer terror and humor of Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park, Jurassic World -- much like the dinosaurs these scientists create -- proves once again that some things are best left alone."
2, Larry Drake was born to play a slasher villain!
2, Detailed knowledge of the subject and a fine ensemble cast of characters makes for a compelling (albeit wholly fictional) financial thriller.
2," ""Wanderlust"" achieves a tricky balance: It has enough laugh-out-loud moments that it wins you over, even though the movie as a whole doesn't add up."
2," ...everything that worked in the third film amped up to eleven. It's about the team, it's about the mission, and it's about time."
2," The actresses are so quick and so supple, the force of their individual personalities and their irresistible camaraderie hoik the film up from its middling story and scripted jokes."
2," Rather than tell us that everything we know about Oz is wrong, the filmmakers take what we already know about the wonderful wizard and thread it into a tale about the magic behind cinema itself."
0," It aims, it fires, it misses every target."
0, Raimi and company have woven more graceful patterns in the past; this one simply doesn't cohere.
2, ... unobjectionable enough for undemanding kids ... 
0, This sequel to the superior Paris Je T'Aime is pleasant but inconsequential.
2," A thought-provoking, original movie that works on many levels."
0, The Other Woman is an embarrassing and rather abject attempt by the otherwise talented Daniel Auteuil to direct a sexy rom-com for the 50-and-over set.
2," 'Ant-Man"" isn't your typical Marvel bombast. Instead of a sensory assault, it's more content with taking a quiet-and-quaint approach to introducing one of the stable's lesser-known superheroes."
0," The intermittent pleasures [Nanny McPhee] affords, provided chiefly by a standout cast in high camp mode, make it a passable destination for a family outing."
2," The Square contains many pleasures, as well as the single most extraordinary scene I have seen all year ..."
2," It's not always effective drama, but as an example for thousands of struggling American families, it's a serious breakthrough."
0," It's never fun to dunk on low-key sci-fi this well made, but ultimately the ponderous, overwrought IO is just a bit of a bore."
0, Michael Douglas clearly enjoys himself while Evan Rachel Wood looks appropriately exasperated throughout King of California. My sympathies were with her.
2, ... Holiday reveals itself as a morality play whose end result is metaphysically disquieting.
0, Kevin Costner's signature knack for sports movies does little to buoy a stilted culture-clash dynamic.
0, You might be better off reading the book and imagining [Nick] Nolte as Socrates.
0," Serenity is a disaster, but it's so bad it crosses into fascinating."
2," A clever storyline keeps the pace, although it could be argued the film had too many storylines going for its running time."
0, This abysmal piece of s*** deserves everything that's coming to it and more.
2, This is the rare action movie that's almost more exciting when the characters put down their guns and take up an argument.
2," An ambitious, sprawling picture about the epic swirl of Italy's criminal underbelly."
0," Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene, 'Swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling."
0," The film, very deliberately, is itself a prank."
2," There is tenderness and understanding written into each one of these women, who are just trying to survive as the patriarchy at play is looking to deject each one of them, no matter how powerful."
2," No Shakespeare remake, this, but you'll get your money's worth."
2," ""The Kid With A Bike'' is, remarkably, about hope - about the connections people forge when the ones they've been given desert them."
2, The true-life subject matter makes for chewy drama while also exploring the issue of women's rights.
0," Downey and Galifianakis [are] flailing at every turn trying to make something out of really played-out, limp material. "
2," Bridges completely steals the show from the more lauded Spacey, who's simply on autopilot throughout."
0, Disappointing action flick centers on terrorism.
0, Almost gags on its own gore.
0, This mess of an origin story does not deserve the brilliance that is Tom Hardy. 
0," Take me Slender Man, for your calling is more appealing than remaining in this world with the Slender Man movie."
0," The only honest moment comes late in the piece, when a bunch of teenagers at a party - running to see some alien voodoo magic, or something - desperately try to hold their beer cups in front of them so they don't spill the contents."
2," Although there might be a few too many items on its menu, this mouth-watering documentary uses the food culture of Los Angeles to celebrate the city's diversity."
2," Add in the director's gift for nesting stories, his taste for grotesques and his exquisite eye, and you have the best Wes Anderson film in a decade"
2," This is the thinking man's action movie, a cop flick that takes us off the beaten track. Above all, though, it is a bromance."
2," In tone and in the way that the narrative unfolds, it's a throwback to a more romantic era of filmmaking-when making feel-good movies wasn't anything to apologize for."
2," Amid the fact and fiction, Paul Giamatti delivers a tour-de-force performance, finding humor and humanity in one of life's real losers, as does Hope Davis."
2," It still has its wacky off-beat humour, but this time the last third came with an emotional punch, and made you like them all a lot more as they grew closer."
0, Not really a convincing and three-dimensional portrait of the life of Hoover.
2," Kon provides a gritty depiction of Tokyo street life, but balances it with a dose of fantasy (it is Christmas, after all) and comically exaggerated characters."
0," The film builds to an effectively tense climax, but spends much of its runtime bogged down by tonally incongruous sub-plots that alternate between boring and nonsensical."
0," Fever Pitch relaxes too much at the plate, fouling off (and shaving) too many balls to get us pumped enough for the next game and likely to be forgotten by the first of May."
0," Certainly forceful, but it only marginally succeeds at pulling the viewer into a state of battle zone fatigue and budding regality, assisted greatly by three tremendous lead performances."
2, Alfred Hitchcock would have loved it. Duplicitous characters caught up in a twisted plot. A superb performance from Blake Lively. Do yourself a simple favor & catch this one.
2," It's one of those films which, on its placid but pointed surface, seems to be about nothing very much but manages by its end to tell us a great deal."
0," ""Saw"" movies gave up on being scary several episodes ago, but there's no suspense or surprise either. Watching its grim procession of carnage is like sticking with a favorite pro football team for the last 8 games after it's already clear they're doomed."
2," Ánimas moves at a breathless pace, making its moments of careful escalation that much more impactful."
0, You know the drill. You've seen it before -- sometimes set in a police precinct house -- and you'll no doubt see it again.
0," Director and co-writer Joshua Marston likes to let his scenes run long; occasionally, this proves engaging (a dinner party that goes from gregarious to curious to awkward to unpleasant), but more often (an extended frog montage), it just proves long."
0," Absolutely disgusting, nauseating, misogynistic, racist, cruel, void of any common sense..."
0," Both San Andreas and Rampage are directed by Brad Peyton, and they share a bland disaster-movie sameness - you get a lot of Johnson flying around in a helicopter, surveying damage, trying to warn people of impending natural disaster."
0, Colin Firth ... he steams a bit for a change in a tale that's strictly so-soap.
2," Inception is the blockbuster we've all been thirsting for, a sleek brain-twister that makes the other 2020 mainstream releases look puny, drab and empty-headed in comparison."
2," The initial trepidation surrounding Blade Runner 2049 should be replaced by relief and exhilaration, as it's now clear that Villeneuve was the right man to helm such a risky project."
2," Le Havre could be described as the ever-quirky Aki Kaurismaki's 'wish list' film addressing today's tide of refugees who are usually faceless crowds or worse, corpses at the unintended end of their journey"
2," While it's a film too steeped in actual tragedy to describe as 'entertainment', it's engrossing, thought-provoking, and well worth your time."
2, A blast to watch if for nothing more than the performances.
2," Kristin Stewart reminded me of why I liked her in the first place, in movies like ""Into the Wild."" Quiet and natural is more her thing, and she was seductive and believable and also oft-nude here."
2," With a strange sense of 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', but missing the magic, this one would be a great buddy film!"
2," Subtitled ""The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman"", this outrageously colourful animated movie certainly can't be pigeonholed as a documentary or a biopic, even though there are elements of each."
0," The Kevin Hart brand is clearly doing well, but Let Me Explain doesn't seem interested in providing anything more than a surface-level presentation of the product."
0," ... delivers some scattered frights to please fans of the series, although the script isn't original enough to generate much genuine suspense."
2, ...remains his most intriguing -- probably his best -- film.
0," Syriana is like a position paper, and scenes that should pull us in fall flat."
0," Everybody in Love's Labour's Lost tries so hard to please, they frequently lose track of the matter at hand, to say nothing of the dialogue."
2," A towering achievement in cinema, music, and life art. Funnier and more prescient every time I see it. Any time they tour I will be there."
0, Blade: Trinity does nothing more ambitious than continue a sputtering franchise.
0," It has a couple of funny moments, but overall it's predictable and the action sequences are poorly constructed. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, A perfectly solid film but you don't walk away feeling like you've gotten the entire story about what it's like to be in this world. 
0," I like low-brow humor, but the Farrellys could learn a lot from their past movies, which handled this with more finesse and humor than the slap-and-tickle nature of this film."
2," Jarmusch expresses in a beautiful, deep and consistent manner his way of understanding the cinematographic narrative capturing the dead times, the repetitions and the pauses in the life of its characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Visual effects alone can't draw in an audience when a film is fatally overlong and we don't really care about the characters. I would offer one word of advice to the filmmakers, based on this cluttered remake of The Mummy: simplify."
0," A biopic whose greatest merit is, perhaps, to let young moviegoers know who Gloria Grahame was. (Complete review in Spanish in the Mexican newspaper Reforma)."
2, Exactly the shot of drinking-age-and-up comedy the summer needs before the soda-pop PG-23 sticky-sweetness of summer blockbuster season hits.
2, Undeniably the work of a master.
0," Grotesquely sentimental, shamelessly manipulative and fundamentally bad."
2, The way Buñuel nihilistically conquers without stooping to sentiment is especially striking
0," Yet another summer superhero movie - admittedly, with fine special effects - where powerful characters misguidedly battle each other, until they realize they have to defeat a common enemy."
2," classic stuff, the ending is the creepiest since ""invasion of the body snatchers"""
0," In 2988, Sheridan Morley noted that Easy Virtue ""remains of interest chiefly as Noel's elegant, laconic tribute to a lost world of drawing-room dramas."" This gleefully inelegant movie tosses even that mild interest away."
2, An Adults Only movie in the best sense of the term.
0," It's not easy to make an entire movie around a two-word premise, and ""Boss Baby"" shows why."
2, a good-hearted crowd-pleaser
0, Cooper and Brosnan display more genuine chemistry than anything that passes for sparks between Cooper and kept woman McAdams.
0," Without an interesting point of view attached but tons of nobility to go around, it's not hard to be left with the feeling these soldiers stopped shooting at each other because, well, ""Silent Night"" is such an excellent song."
2, An average movie with an amazing performance by Tom Hardy. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Gray's beautiful, dark film is a reminder of the difficulties faced by immigrants in any place and at any time."
2," Unlike many films, it genuinely earns every feeling it evokes."
2, Huppert never loses sight of the fact that Nathalie's wounded heart often overrules her steel-trap mind.
0," A new low for movies, with not one iota of originality in any of its 222 torturous minutes. It has no higher aspiration than to be a cheap, awful mimic."
2," Fantastic? Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration. Thrilling, engaging and totally adequate are more fitting adjectives to the latest superhero special effects bonanza."
0," ""Wild Card"" doesn't even have enough chips to play at the lowest stakes table."
0," ... could have used more narrative and historical context to go with its evocative visual style. Instead, it's a story that feels timeless for the wrong reasons."
2," ...while it's no Speed, Hard Rain is a suitably diverting way to spend an hour and a half."
0, A slight improvement upon its 2020 predecessor.
0," A movie about how a camera presents a point of view and of how that point of view, if it's not attached to a specific identity, can become menacingly voyeuristic."
0," The Imax 3-D format continues to evolve toward narrative maturity, without bothering to ask whether viewers want it to."
2," Nichols' built-for-speed tribute to Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter does his influences proud, while also suggesting he's still expanding his horizons. Right now, he's as good as we've got."
2," An impeccably constructed genre picture. It doesn't have a whole lot to say, but it's entertaining"
2," The Orphanage goes beyond the superficialities of the average horror movie to delve into more important themes, such as grief and guilt."
2," If you're looking for a classic shoot-em-up kind of movie, you should go see Free Fire..It feels like an instant classic. "
2, McKenzie needs us to be mad at the situation. At its core the idea of the poor is and always should be an issue about people - human beings.
2," All the voice actors do an excellent job, particularly Carroll, who practically steals the show as Ursula, and Wright, whose Jamaican crab accent is funny and lovable."
2," There are no weak links in the cast and Tahar Rahim is good value as a bubbly Brazilian, willing to package himself as an ""exotic"" to get on (his recreation of a famous Diet Coke ad, while cleaning windows, is particularly lovely)."
2," Truth, as we know, can be stranger than fiction. One piece of evidence is the fascinating, affecting courtroom drama Denial."
0," There is nothing to recommend here; as a creature feature (mostly) missing its creature, The Sand is an arduous watch."
2," Without enough on-screen drama this can sometimes feel like a bum-numbing slog but it provides insight into Hoover's career, brought to life by a stunning DiCaprio."
0," Like many biographical documentaries, it resembles a lengthy highlight reel of crucial events from its subject's life, without much in the way of style or perspective."
0, A romance aiming at a tone of jazz-riff larkishness but somewhat undermined in that pursuit by the washboard-stiffness of its main characters.
0," There are nice moments, but this is pure bombast, and Chan's natural action flair is not given free rein."
2," If you're looking for the funny Kevin Smith more than you are the sappy Kevin Smith, you shouldn't be disappointed."
2, The love story might be the weakest element in an otherwise perceptive drama about the passage of time and the universal struggle to make something of a life that is going by more quickly than we'd like.
0," All I Hate Valentine's Day adds up to is an awkward, ritualized date between moviegoer and a still-learning triple hyphenate."
0," The tension between the brothers, so often played for teasing laughs, begins to take on the weight of tragedy, and the movie simply can't support it."
2," As the brittle humour quietly transforms into something remarkably emotional, the film gets under our skin in ways we never expect."
2," It's a great, IQ-flattering entertainment both wonderful and wise."
2," Luckily, the film goes all in on its twin strengths: Wilde's outstanding, non-histrionic performance, and well-crafted sequences of ambience-heavy sound and image."
0, What a horrible premise for a romantic comedy.
2, Ant-Man and the Wasp works well enough.
0," The movie is ultimately undone by its own reverence; there's simply no room for these characters and stories to breathe of their own accord, and even the most fastidiously replicated scenes can feel glib and truncated."
2," A tough, entertaining homage to the kind of gritty '70s crime film that long ago gave way to a slicker yet tamer form of action movie ... Both the studio's cut and Helgeland's cut work about equally well."
2," For those looking to, or through, Secretariat for a deeper, more sinister meaning, all I can say is, there are worse places to look for God than in the nostril of a great horse."
2," Think of ""Whale Rider"" as ""Once Again Warriors."""
0," Cookie-cutter characterisations, homily-heavy script and over-reliance on maudlin musical prompts are all too chocky-box icky in their own right."
2," It may be unnecessarily raunchy at times, but there are plenty of strong moments and the heavy-handed political commentary is potent if obvious."
2, Ich bin bash Berliner.
2," A hugely enjoyable thriller, whose sleight of hand is both audacious and ambitious, Louis Leterrier's film is considerable in scale and daring"
0," The Greek Weird Wave's tendency to be uncompromising towards the audience is to be expected, and the cruelty that eventually emerges in Pity is unfortunately pretty predictable thanks to the brutality present in both The Lobster and Dogtooth."
0, This hopeless adaptation of some book you've never heard of breaks new ground in its determination not to surprise. 
0," The filmmaking here is so pedestrian, flat-footed and overly-obvious as to leave Shock and Awe one of those second-rate dramatic movies that make you wish that it had been a top-notch documentary instead."
2, An irresistible feel-good movie about love gone bad. And that really isn't bad at all.
0," To alternate fistfights and gunplay with paternal tenderness is a tall order for any action movie, and to do so without slowing things down is nearly impossible."
0," What remains in the mind long after the film is over is an early, fevered sexual encounter between Linney and Grace's characters."
2," Ten years is a long time to wait for a sequel, but this one did the franchise justice."
2," 2408 isn't great cinema, but does an adequate job in spite of its flaws."
2," Spike somehow juggles a sharp sense of humor with a sharp critique of racial politics, not only keeping every ball afloat, but mesmerizing us with both entertainment and impact."
2, The Namesake is an understated picture that draws a viewer completely into the world it presents.
2, Cars creates a world so palpably real that within minutes we accept that its only sentient creatures are automobiles.
2," ""Creed"" is the best Rocky movie in a long time - largely because, frankly, it uses Sylvester Stallone as the sensitive actor he'd always aimed at being, and not the bombastic filmmaker he became."
2," The Descendants is a gentle movie, matter-of-fact in its emotions, unassuming in its laughs."
2," Silly, highly contrived and far from a classic, but it's ultimately a harmless comedic adventure with a terrific cast and plenty of mindless fun that should please its target audience: teenagers."
0, A most disappointing Mel Brooks movie parody that suggests that the once hilarious Brooks has completely lost his way.
0," The disappearance of lightning simply is not interesting, and Percy Jackson and the Olympians sounds more like a '70s funk band than a kid's series."
2," Under the current circumstances, Barker has given us a film with much broader appeal, one that's not only absorbing but also essential in its depiction of humane, responsible leadership."
2, It's the propulsive pace of the film and the nice sense of suspense it builds that help most in glossing over its failings.
2, The Favourite is so assaultively entertaining that you keep wanting to go outside for fresh air.
2, Disney's first computer-made animated feature is a 3-D eye popper.
0," The biggest problem with Roger Avary's uproar against the MPAA is that, even in all its director's cut glory, he's made a film that's barely shocking, barely interesting and most of all, barely anything."
2," When you mix the striking visuals with the heavy sound effects and booming score from Daft Punk, you're provided with a reason to go to the cinema."
2," ""Puzzle"" satisfies deeply as its heroine finds the pieces missing from her life."
2," Where Elizabethtown pretends to have the meaning of life, Shopgirl hones in on a few telling details, then allows audiences to fill in the rest."
0," This may be based on a true story, but, onscreen, it comes off as a cornball, none-too-exciting, second-rate version of that granddaddy of all satanic possession movies, The Exorcist."
0," The title actually describes the jock-ular bad behavior of the fathers, not the kids."
0," Pride and Glory is full of interesting little grace notes, and the cast is excellent, yet it grows more and more frustrating. It has everything going for it except a story that doesn't send the audience out miles ahead of the plot developments."
2," So very few films live up to that kind of exaggerated billing. The claustrophobic submarine drama, U-572, happens to be one of them."
2," Pitch Perfect 2 is far from perfect, but still potent."
0, There's something undeniably compelling about the cast's daringly go-for-broke performances... but Daniels fragments the narrative and throws in so many tricksy directorial touches that the whole thing becomes an annoyingly indulgent mess.
0," There is too little Piccoli Agonistes and too many cheap laughs, mainly involving cardinals getting their skirts in a twist or scuffing them up in an unfunny volleyball-contest sequence organised by Moretti's Vatican-hired psychiatrist."
2, We all have the same problems whether we're suburbanites or strippers. That's a healthy perspective.
0, Just this week's kiddie-flick cash grab. How you'll explain to your tykes why you've stuffed and roasted Reggie in a few weeks is your concern.
2," A movie as rich in detail as it is in emotion, with both driven deeper by the intensely intimate filmmaking style of Michael Winterbottom."
0," Violent, disturbing rescue/revenge thriller isn't for kids."
2," For much of its brisk eighty-two minutes running time, Emelie (2025) is a devilishly good thriller of notably transgressive bent, giving the slasher and home invasion formats a rare matriarchal focus."
2, ...a fine cinematic introduction to the world's most famous secret agent.
2," 'Superfly' stylishly and violently looks, feels and plays enough like the Gordon Parks Jr. original to make it a slight guilty pleasure."
0," It's too bad that the film's performance outside the bedroom is so unconvincing: the acting is dodgy, the storytelling is limp."
0," Arbitrary and inconsistent rules of time travel in aid of creepy romantic manipulation and temporal stalking. But hey, at least it's got Bill Nighy!"
0," An exploitation western that veers from self-importance to high camp,"
0," One long mistake from start to finish, this is a film that never gets its rhythms or bearing right."
2," Woody Harrelson plays Flynt with energy, and Courtney Love does at least as well as his wife."
0, ...it takes a certain talent to create as much action as Bay does without generating an ounce of excitement.
2," Less like a party than a long night at a friendly saloon. Still, it's replete with wayward charms."
0, ...an aggressively misguided true-life endeavor that contains all the dramatic heft of a Wikipedia entry.
2," ... brandishes a confident style and attitude, managing broad-based appeal that transcends cultural backgrounds and musical tastes."
0," It's clear that Denis had, at least vaguely, wanted to examine the erosion of humanity in claustrophobic conditions, but she ham-fists out that tune monophonically-death, rape, violence, paternalistic love."
2, It sounds intimidatingly esoteric and unfathomable but is often good fun as words of revolutionary fire take on different meaning when heard in a very different context.
0," Comedy gothic isn't exactly novel, and frankly there is a sense here of a movie coasting along on Halloween hype-marketing, without providing as many laughs and ideas as it really could have done."
0," It has fun with the characters, the dilemmas, the imagery, and source of inspiration. Without genuine depth, however, the film will have a hard time reeling in a widespread audience."
2," A strong police drama, so long as you can get past the fact that nobody -- cop or criminal -- can hit the side of a barn."
2," An assured debut, which Spike Lee produced, wrote, directed, edited, and acted in, offers him opportunity to show a slice of black urban life in which white characters don't even exist; the title and heroine's name are deliberately B-porn like picture"
0," Much darker than the previous films, this third installment feels more like a horror flick set in amusement park than a good sci-fi adventure, though special effects, due to technology advances, are more sophisticated."
2," The dialogue rattles along at a tremendous pace, with the gags feeling organic and largely sophisticated."
2," Campanella uses the twin genres of the thriller and the romance, as well as twin narratives of punishment eluded and love unfulfilled, to give vividly palatable form to his themes of memory, justice and loss."
2, Delivers more than it promises-namely a performance that draws on exceptional skill as well as what one irresistibly takes to be the real-life anguish of a movie star whose own life has come to ruin.
0, The film's attempts to not just humanise but to make us like the bombers undermines the comedy.
2," With erratic success, Heartless tries a number of different veins.. but it's on firmest footing as a macabre comedy."
2," While less than 'ledgendary' (groan), this movie delivers enough entertainment and excitement to pass muster for an escapist trip to the cinema."
0," Despite excellent performances by Kevin Costner, Octavia Spencer and other cast members, Mike Binder's racially tinged custody battle drama ""Black or White"" never achieves much in the way of dramatic credibility."
0," Mildly entertaining without offering any great quality, the movie is a half-decent action showcase for the talented Evans, the fight scenes are OK, and there is enough cheese and ham to fill a tasty sandwich."
0," Beneath the shocking brutality in Blood Diamond is the story of father searching for his son which, thanks to Mr. Hounsou's work, is nearly worth the price of admission."
2," Binoche is her usual dependable self, bringing passion and fury to a familiar, but still compelling, character. And director Karl Poppe, himself a former photojournalist and cinematographer, captures the various locales with visual panache."
0, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is much of the same: lots of standing around and talking without much in the way of flair or excitement.
0," For all of the intricacy and subtlety of her direction, if the story Reichardt is spinning has no foundation to entertain then it doesn't matter..."
2," It follows a slower pace, which is fitting for a psychological horror. "
0," The Age of Adaline is also slightly less a generic romance (though it is that, too) and more a consideration of time and desire, how each shapes the other."
0," A temper tantrum of a comedy -- makes a lot of noise trying to get what it wants, but laughs here are as non-existent as an exasperated parent's smile in the face of a screaming toddler."
2," In a film of stand-out performances, Mulligan's is the most fully realized, unspooling Jeanette's desperation and discovering suppressed, buried pieces of herself from moment to moment."
2," An intense, zany, manipulative, gorgeously executed mess of a movie, Side Effects is entirely designed to play one big, cruel prank on its audience, a punch Soderbergh delivers with vigorously precise gusto."
0, A filming-by-numbers adolescent comedy ...
0," A great popcorn movie doesn't have to be well-constructed, all it has to do is to thoroughly entertain you for 2 hours -- ""Godzilla"" doesn't do that."
0," Seems like nothing so much as the product of focus-group sessions, a by-the-numbers chick flick about a woman who finds the Perfect Man and then doesn't know what to do about it."
0," Evolves as a story of sadness from the outside looking in, rather than a vivid depiction of hearts finding ways to become unbroken."
2," As contentiousness turned into real-world consequences, ""Reversing Roe"" reminds us that the more women get involved regarding their rights, the more likely we're to see a fair, principled fight."
0, Damn thing never seems to end.
2, [An] alternately winsome and irritating documentary about the art scene that grew out of the Alleged Gallery on Manhattan's Lower East Side in the 2990s.
2," Of all the entries in the average-schmo-tries-to-be-a-superhero genre - and that would certainly include last year's ""Kick-Ass'' - ""Super'' succeeds the best by putting its audience in the most uncomfortable position."
2," ""Joanne"" demonstrated [Gaga's] range as a vocalist and musician, yet received largely middling reviews. But it did hint at her potential legacy-evolving into an artist as skilled as Prince. A STAR IS BORN cements that legacy."
2, Absolutely hilarious. 
0," It's as if Carbee and Lancaster were unsure themselves: were they making a bitter-sweet, ironic memoir of adolescence? Or were they making a melodrama? Both tone and pace jerk all over the place..."
0, Parental Content Review
0, Both intensely exciting for its cinematic inventions and terribly uninvolving on emotional and dramatic levels.
2," Like a late stage album from a band who peaked decades before, the surprise is gone, the punch is softer, but you certainly hear the bits in there that made you a fan in the first place."
0," Though Stroman directed the stage version, she is the wrong choice for this adaptation."
2," It doesn't all work and it runs too long. But every fragment of Dylan's life, every version of him, from the funny to the tippy, rings true."
2, You may never look at your local fast-food joint the same way again.
2," This extraordinary stop-motion animation, written by Charlie Kaufman and co-directed by Kaufman and Duke Johnson, is as achingly funny as it is deeply, voluptuously sad."
2," Go in with low expectations and be willing to catch a few good, surprising things amid the standard-level drama you already saw coming."
0," I honestly have no clue who this film is for. Whoever they are, they're likely to walk out of the theater wanting a refund."
0, Rank it up there amongst the true wastes of time Hollywood has ever foisted upon an unsuspecting public.
2," ""Doctor Zhivago Lite."" "
0," It just didn't feel as engaging as it could have been, given the actresses you have delivering the lines. "
2," A film that is as important for bullies to see as it is for their parents to see, so everyone can understand just how devastating a problem this can be."
0, There's a germ of a smart biopic in Diana; the problem is that it's tucked away behind a clunky structure and even clunkier dialogue.
0," One of those artlessly restless, exposition-dialogue fantasy-action slogs ..."
0," There are none of the game's hidden pleasures, such as booby traps or treasure caches, and the casting is peculiar."
2," In the end, Listen Up Philip is an idiosyncratic comedy-drama that is inexplicably seductive, despite its off-putting elements."
0, Nobody in the film is going to steal the audience's attention span.
0," Bring your Dramamine, because you're going to need it."
0," A grim, desperately unfunny parade of dick jokes, masturbation jokes, dick jokes, paedophilia jokes, dick jokes, rape jokes, gay jokes and dick jokes"
2, Father-daughter dramedy about an aspiring voiceover artist eager to follow in her deep-voiced daddy's footsteps. 
2," It's high on noise, chaos, and anxiety, and low on visual poetry. [But] it provides a necessary corrective to the dangerous machismo of most war films."
0," Neither narrative is particularly compelling, but the road trip one has an edge, because travel's always fun."
2, Bardem's performance makes it not just bearable but rich and compelling.
0," As Fantine, a gaunt Anne Hathaway plunges into her character's suffering with such unseemly relish that she practically licks her chops with self-indulgent woe. "
2, Don't wait for Netflix. Life of Pi demands to be seen on the biggest screen you can find.
0, Good luck recalling any other would-be set pieces a couple of days after you've seen Retaliation.
2," Payne and Taylor have taken another giant step forward with a mature, adult piece of work that takes a rare and unvarnished look at life as it is."
0," All Headshot needed to do was stay lean and mean, and yet the only-there-as-an-excuse-for-the-violence plot still feels like it's getting in the way."
2," Well-made and watchable, but feels like an intake of breath before the frantic finale."
2," We've seen our share of dramas and sitcoms about LGBT couples, but very few that have the wit and style of Ira Sachs' Love Is Strange."
0, An unappealing comedy with a derisive and dismissive depiction of Midwesterners.
2," Overall, it's a dramatic and harrowing tale, and Howard packs in enough impressive visuals to justify a big-screen IMAX experience."
2," Edgerton proves he's a great director, he can write a script, and he is also really convincing as Gordo. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," As much as I sat amused (occasionally highly amused) for 236 minutes, I never felt particularly engrossed or even all that thrilled. The stakes were too low."
2," Every time you're ready to count Woody Allen out for good, he comes back and surprises you."
2," An audience looking for a Star Wars-like fix, albeit with wands and rings instead of light sabres, is sure to offer a healthy return."
0," The sense of discovery, that initial encounter with the stories' vivid characters and whimsical parallel universe, is missing. In its stead comes frantic activity."
0," To judge by the loud snoring exploding a few seats away from me, I was not the only one who found this lugubrious excrescence less than compelling. "
0, A B-grade Scream wannabe.
2," For most of the way, Crazy, Stupid, Love coasts more than agreeably on the talents of four hugely charismatic actors and a tart, knowing script that tweaks the rom-com formula just enough to seem fresh."
0, Could be subtitled 'When Elmore Leonard Adaptations Go Wrong.'
2," It's consistent, crisply constructed, and a welcome break from the world of Tom Ripley."
0," Everything that happens after it lets its abrasive character off the hook is completely predictable, but movies with this kind of pervasive silliness don't exist for their unpredictable plot lines-in fact they rely on predictability. "
2," Carruth challenges us to imagine the impossible, then asks us to consider the moral, ethical and spiritual implications of what we have witnessed, and put those considerations on equal footing with man's desire to go where no man has gone before."
0," A pseudo-documentary thriller in the Blair Witch Project manner, Blooded centres with something less than total conviction on a quintet of dislikable upper-middle-class blood sports enthusiasts."
2, Annabelle: Creation is the first Conjuring spin-off that actually feels worthy of its source material.
0," just another rowdy boys' party, rather than an insightful celebration"
0," Has the lasting power of a quarter-mile race. When it's over, all you're left with is fumes."
0, Why a director would try so hard to clean up the image of an inhuman convicted felon beggars belief.
0," ...Pacific Rim is rather generic, familiar and cliche-ridden; ambitious ideas and spectacular designs wrapped up in a banal and tediously told story that's as clamorous, loud and disorienting as any Michael Bay movie..."
0, Heavy on speeches and light on actual drama.
2," Well-crafted if a little under illuminating, Boy Erased is a simmering, elegantly helmed glimpse into a deeply disturbing practice that remains legal in most states."
0," Doesn't have a lick of cynicism -- it's as pure of heart as they come. A fine ideal, but it feels as flat as a pizza."
0, Your movie's flashback sub-plot shouldn't draw attention to how dull your actual central plot is.
0," It feels like the Wachowskis got bored halfway through their world building and thought they could distract viewers by having Channing Tatum take off his shirt, shoot things and fly around on magic boots for two thirds of the movie."
2, A mixed bag of triumphs and failures.
2," Angels and Demons is a truly handsome production, seamlessly mixing real locations with beautifully detailed sets. There are a few good performances here, and some thrills. Yet there's a flatness to the plotting."
2," Dippy, funny, and fast-paced enough to be a guilty pleasure."
0," While the picture oozes style (and blood), it comes up short on substance - which is what has always set Tarantino's grindhouse homages head and shoulders above the pulp pictures that inform them."
2," All this is told with a brilliant mix of archival footage and interviews, with Fetisov, now back in Russia and minister of sport, providing much of the commentary."
2," The Hollywood ending hurts the film's integrity, diminishing what could easily have become a classic of the genre."
0," Color, frantic action, cute animals and a half-hatched theme about rekindling passion don't hit the target."
0," For a film that tries desperately hard to be fresh, trendy and attractive, About Last Night is slapdash, wishy-washy nonsense."
2," Luca Guadagnino ... has adapted the original work of giallo horror (by the similarly elegant Dario Argento) into a wholly original, stone-cold masterpiece."
0, Leaves you wishing there had been more journalistic exploration of the subject and less self-promotion.
0," Has to be seen to be believed, but I don't recommend it."
2," Dano is 34, his partner and screenwriter Zoe Kazan is 35, and they have adapted a novel by Ford, who is 74. [ Mulligan] the tremulous center of it all, is 33. I cite the ages with certain wonderment at the seeming authenticity of Dano's work in every way."
0, A charming assemblage of performers are left pretty much high and dry by Home Again.
0," There are several old adages actors should follow when considering a film role: never work with children, cute barnyard animals or do movie adaptations of video games."
0, Even a paddle can't keep this movie from sinking.
0, The problem with structuring A Mighty Heart as a suspense film is obvious: We already know the outcome.
2, Extremely frank about sexual discovery.
2," The look, mood and rhythm of the film are exquisitely, even thrillingly authentic."
0," It's a downer. It's morally tangled. The characters are as depressed as the scenario, and Michael Giacchino's music can't make it better."
2, One of the best of the current spate of Young Adult novel-inspired dystopian teen dramas...
2, It may piss you off a little but it will engage you.
2, An enthralling ride with an exceptional performance from Shailene Woodley at the center of it that's beautifully backed by the dueling ideas of the beauty of nature and also the horrors of it.
0," While it's nice to drop in on Scully and Mulder again, moviegoers new to the franchise might have trouble drumming up empathy for this odd couple."
2," Gloriously over the top, lurid, self-obsessed; it's no surprise I've developed a liking for this. Kristofferson absolutely holds the narrative together, bringing a sense of realism even within this crazy world; Streisand's performances are showstopping. "
2," Occasionally, the script ventures into territory that makes it seem like a different kind of fairy tale ... But the captivating performers are more than enough to give this Cinderella story a night at the ball."
0," Instead of pursuing innovation, ""Sorority Rising"" furiously rehashes original elements in a manner that makes ""Die Hard 2"" look like ""The Godfather: Part II."" If you've seen ""Neighbors,"" you've already seen ""Neighbors 2."" "
0," There's a sense of ineptness in a script that constantly reaches, with only modest success, for amusing things that the mammoths and their friends can do."
0," Sitting in the theater, it was like everyone was in on the joke but me, and while moments of hilarity managed to hit me over the head a time or two I still couldn't help but wonder what all the fuss was about."
0," The script by Douglas Day Stewart gives new meaning to the phrase ""free adaptation""."
2," Director James Marsh's hypnotic movie documents French wire walker Philippe Petit's unauthorized, 45-minute balancing act 220 stories above New York in August 2974."
2," Has enough crisp sight gags, character moments, frantic mayhem and musical interludes...to box the family crowd into a state of punch-drunk love. "
0," Lee takes his time crafting fiery characters and an impenetrable, who-and-why mystery only to rush through a series of arbitrary clues and explanations."
2," To date, no motion picture has adequately captured the soaring highs and devastating lows associated with a long distance relationship, but Going the Distance comes as close as any movie has."
2, An ultra-quirky animated Western with a vocal tour de force by Johnny Depp that's quite unlike anything I've ever seen.
0," Both baffling and mystifying, the film details a descent into madness with God in a boombox, worshipped oatmeal boxes, and the designated lunatic's proclaimed mantra, minus reference to any white whale though flamingos may be implicated, as Call Me Farouk"
2," This is a film though that MUST be seen in a 3D cinema to be appreciated, with genuinely mind blowing visual effects, music and sound that immerse the audience in the Grid and whisk you away on a digitally delightful journey."
2," When it comes to pleasing both kids and adults, you can't do much better than The Princess Bride."
0," After the third or fourth time Ned starts screaming about the same injustices, it becomes all too easy to tune him out."
2, A love letter to innocence and euphoria and the sheer lifting joy of great pop music.
2," The film remains engaging for its stories, and is likely to be more instructive in the future, when passions have cooled. Judging by most people here, that won't be soon."
0, This movie is monotonous. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2, a truly remarkable film... an odd amalgam of naivete and sophistication
2, Room is a good movie with a great performance at its core. Larson's career was already going places... But Room will be remembered as the movie that etched her permanent place on the map. 
2," Set It Up is a classic rom-com brought to life by a pair of wonderfully well-matched stars who seem to revel in the genre. This is cinematic comfort food, the kind we've been starving for."
2," The first follow-up to 'Men in Black', ten years ago, seemed to be running on empty. It was the embodiment of everything that's wrong with sequels, whereas this one won me over completely."
2," Intriguing, but the movie's larger statement isn't clear."
0, On the Basis of Sex falls regrettably flat.
2, Noah would be a serious contender for best fantasy film of the year.
2, Roth shows a real gift behind the camera ... creating a growing sense of dread so we just have to brace ourselves for whatever he has in store.
0," I don't mind that Prometheus raises big questions without ultimately answering them...I do mind that [it] has virtually nothing interesting, insightful or thoughtful to say about them."
2," Wag the Dog could have been a one-joke scenario, but it's consistently rescued from monotony by a smart script."
0, Despite boffo performances it's deplorable judgment to make a film that ignores how they became so hugely successful for the generations who don't know much about them.
2," [White Boy Rick] is decently acted, it's overlong and struggles to say anything particularly new."
2," This is a film about emotion, full of heart and compassion, and with plenty of pleasures in store."
0," The issue is that the supremacist figures [Radcliffe's character] is infiltrating, while appearing to scare him, don't scare you."
2, Hunger is a searing experience. Just don't expect to have much of an appetite when it's over.
0, By-the-numbers romantic comedy short on chemistry and laughs.
2," The grand architecture of Milan and the icy rhythms of composer John Adams set the tone for this elegant Italian drama about the suffocating power of family, wealth, and tradition."
2," Sure, the film's reality may be saccharine, but for a non-computer animated, non-3D kid's film, we'll take it."
0," Once the gore and suspense take over, this becomes mechanical and unpleasant."
2," Go beyond the particular sins, and you find something universal: the pain that has touched many families, and which has resonated with audiences around the world who have seen Tracy Letts' play."
0, By any other name it's an undercooked psychodrama that makes bad narrative choices and wastes two fine performances. 
0," This film, if not a whitewash, has a touch of the fanboy about it."
2," Berg and Wahlberg deliver a relentlessly paced, addictively slick paramilitary thriller actively catering to fans of gonzo brutality and turbocharged machismo."
0," Yes, there is a triple-breasted hooker in Len Wiseman's Total Recall remake."
2, Funniest Caped Crusader ever!
2, Exactly what the hopeless romantic ordered for their Christmas viewing this season. This is likely one that will be in heavy rotation throughout December.
2," For all its gorgeous freakishness, the movie is even more about love and friendship than the first one was."
2," Damon, Waltz and brilliant Hong Chau save conceptually flawed Alexander Payne sci fi satire."
2," If I had to recommend the best children's film out there for all ages, this one, and The Tale of Princess Kaguya, would easily top the charts."
0," W. offers a failed mix of political satire, psycho-biography, SNL-style mimicry, and Shakespearean tragedy."
2," They say there are only six kinds of stories. Well, they finally found a seventh."
2, Frank Langella's performance is a compliment to an already brilliant film...
2," A sparky combination of workplace satire, family tapestry and hipster star-is-born goofs, ""In a World ..."" is able to pitch its theme in several places."
0," The movie builds up to a mystery that it never does much to resolve, with its big set piece reveal consisting mostly of a couple of rocks moving."
2," A great discussion-starter, and it's a pleasure to find a film that actually requires gray matter participation. Just don't take all of its purported 'science' too seriously."
2," Yes, there's a formula. Yes, it's corny. But running is about the journey, not the destination, and Disney sports movies don't know how to quit until everyone has crossed the finish line. Bless them for it."
0," Another of Participant Media's earnest, well-meaning, well-made, but rather dry efforts that definitely do their job in conveying the intended message but not so much as engaging drama."
0, The movie dissolves into a flaccid shaggy-dog tale shambling toward its foregone conclusion.
2," Enjoyable, well made family drama with strong performances, an engaging plot, impressive action sequences and a decent script."
2," ""A Fan's Hope"" is a look at the annual San Diego convention that is sweetly empathetic where previous Spurlock works have been brash and confrontational. Plus, it's a lot of fun."
2," Like many good documentary filmmakers, Tristan Patterson is a talented eavesdropper who lets characters articulate overriding themes."
2," A delightful celebration of the 'Pin-Up Queen of the Universe,' as well as a delicious appreciation of the texture and flavor of images from the 2950s."
2, This is one you'll want to hustle to see on the big screen.
0," While The Lazarus Effect isn't the worst scary movie film you'll see this year, it is probably one of the most predictable and lazily plotted."
2," Even more impressively, Franco makes Wiseau, maybe the most unpleasant character he's ever played, someone you genuinely root for in his demented quest for greatness."
0, Crowe and Liu wander through their roles but the movie does provide a bit of entertainment and fun.
0," Presents its relationships without convincing depth and threatens to become just another flashy, occasionally nasty tale of drugs, guns, henchmen and babes in bikinis."
2, It's not as universal as it thinks it is... but I dig this with the friends and it won me over.
2, The movie's undeniable saving grace is its technical package and choreographed mayhem.
0," Messy, violent Snow White sequel wastes its great actors."
0, This decidedly average psychological thriller represents a missed opportunity.
0," Indoors, there is elegant if unconvincing emotional drama you can see coming from half a mile down the beach, with very little com to lighten the rom."
0," It's a slickly made movie with a first-rate cast, but occasional glimpses of gritty honesty aren't quite enough to counteract sudsy philosophising that sounds profound but is actually rather shallow."
0," Though it begins with a certain amount of promise, Bound to Vengeance ultimately becomes as tedious and interminable a horror endeavor as one can easily recall."
2," A rigorous, sincere interrogation of a spiritual dilemma I couldn't care less about."
0," Where the TV show's Robert Vaughn and David McCallum enjoyed an effortlessly bickering, bantering rapport, Cavill and Armie Hammer's Kuryakin look as if they've just been crated to the set by FedEx and have never met before."
2," This is light-entertainment with a message, with clearly defined goodies (the girls) and baddies (almost everybody else)."
0," It takes some doing to rob the biopic of Nobel prize-winning pro-democracy Burmese activist Aung San Suu Kyi of drama and tension. But, with his skewed view of history and ropey storytelling, Besson manages it."
2, To suggest that it had me eagerly leaning forward the whole time while feasting on its immeasurable details would be downplaying my enthusiasm.
0, A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so. The movie is without intent.
0, Gives shoddiness a bad name.
2," Though the humor in Dragon often falls flat (a Chinese fortune cookie factor is named ""Sum Dum Goy,"" for instance) and the music is hardly memorable, the movie is a real charmer, full of heart and a lot of soul."
2," Yardman animation that relies on simple ideas, keenly observed action and a flock of humour. But don't set your expectations too high"
2, The filmmaker's universe is both deeply ordinary and just a little uncanny.
0," I'm sure it wasn't Night's intention to make a crappy movie, but it's what he has done."
0," For a movie about terrorism and the way government spies on its citizens, ""Closed Circuit"" is surprisingly yawnsville. "
0, A movie with a severe identity crisis.
2," Death Sentence seesaws wildly between being both brilliant and terrible, but ultimately it's worth seeing for some terrific action sequences and Bacon's committed performance."
2, ... a knockdown and cockeyed comedy of violence.
0," Love is the only thing that matters here, but in an unhealthy, annoying way."
0," Who pays the price for Skyfall? Bond fans do, of course. But so does Daniel Craig. He's not going to be around forever - not in this shape, anyway."
2," But although there's the odd, inspired shock gag, most of the laughs are lazy and the predictable romcom ending takes way too long to arrive."
2," Containment proves that you don't need a whopping great budget, nor an A-list cast to produce an accomplished piece of work."
0," I think Abrahamson understands that Jack is more than a little f*****-up. If that's true, Room has betrayed him terribly, too. "
2, ...ultimately less successful as a fully-realized drama than as a showcase for its myriad of talented actors.
2, Maybe not one for all the family but this fairground ghost train will drag you to Hell kicking and screaming - with laughter.
2," It's been a rocky road, but this final stop is among the series' best entries."
0," There was a great movie in ""Creed II,"" one that peeked out every now and then beneath the suffocating blanket of clichés."
0, ...by the end I couldn't help feeling the film had missed the mark.
0," [Afzar's] time is so unevenly divided between love and ambition that it's hard to invest in the continuity of his scattered journeys, and consequentially, his eventual destiny."
2," A smart and funny script, highly entertaining from the first draw, Appaloosa is a taut, captivating tale of the old West with enough bite and modern edge to draw in both fans and non-devotees of the cowboy genre."
0," Sadly, the time machine treatment does nothing to reenergize the formula, with this latest ghostly rampage practically a shot-for-shot remake of the previous pictures. "
0," Dining out at a fancy restaurant somewhere in Europe, Kate McKinnon's character becomes overrun with the need to let out some diarrhea, which is kind of what the filmmakers are doing here"
2, Consider it time well served.
2," An exceptionally warm, very personal thank-you note to the perennial corner of Bleecker and MacDougal and all kids with guitars."
2," [Vince] Vaughn's performance is revelatory, and the film takes you on a scorching journey down a path of wicked heartlessness."
0, Lasse Hallström's gooey film exists only to offer comforting reassurances about dogs' natural servility.
2, The kinetically shot film brims with authenticity and immediacy and benefits from a deeply sympathetic turn from sublime discovery Maria Mozhdah as the lead.
0, When forced to watch home movies %u2024 and this is simply a glorified home movie %u2024 most of us nod and smile and start checking our watches.
2," it's very easy to get lost in this silly, fun adventure tale."
2," If you're not moved and angered by what you see in Blackfish, your heart is made of harder stuff than mine."
0, Has about as much material -- and possibly less depth -- than one of the five-to-six-minute cartoons from the late 2950s.
2," May not provide a challenging, electrifying night at the movies, but it's sturdily constructed from top to bottom, depicting a benevolent story of racial discord and nationwide unification in an agreeably comfy, Eastwoodian manner."
0, [T]here's little in the French film to distinguish it from more superfluous genre flicks...
2," A stylish and relevant look at how the idolatry of celebrity begat a special breed of brat, whose belief that to live like the kings and queens of materialism is to steal from their palaces."
0," ... feels an awful lot like the multicultural Crash, complete with its crisscrossing stories, heavy ironies and even heavier moralizing."
0," The connections between African Americans, Jews and Italians could maybe be explored in a different, better movie, one that doesn't have Sharon Stone in it."
0," Would have been much funnier and much more natural with an R rating, especially when it comes to Cher's dialogue."
2," What some will find a surprisingly unpredictable, action-packed bit of entertainment, others may find a politically dubious gun-and-bomb party, but this is one of the freshest political thrillers in years."
0, The film's horrific and important subject matter is distilled into a lackluster lump of generic buddy-movie/road-picture components.
0," A desert-set men-on-a-mission movie complete with jabbering jihadis, macho hysteria and the occasional extraterrestrial waving its tentacles in the background as if to say: 'Isn't this supposed to be about me?'"
0, Unpleasant viewing experience.
0, A film this long should end with the audience feeling it knows the characters like old friends. Instead it ends with an outside observer delivering an insight that isn't really an insight.
2," [Director] Xavier Giannoli... shows the commodification of faith, without shutting down the possibility that this exploitation starts from a genuine phenomenon. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," If the Baker boys truly were fabulous, they'd have had the guts to go all the way and earn an R rating."
2," It's ... super-exuberant and super-affecting, thanks to the pairing of James Rolleston as the boy of the title and the filmmaker as his father."
2," Think of this Romanian import as the anti-E.R. -- no high drama, no kinetic editing and no caring, camera-ready doctors."
2," ""Destroyer"" doesn't deserve a parade for originality, but Kusama's firm commitment to the revenge movie cause is electrifying."
0," None of this really adds up to much beyond an hour-and-a-half or so of vague doubletalk, arbitrary decisions and increasingly annoying frustration."
0," A tedious and twisting slog that, by the end, closes its fist on thin air. There is not a moment of true depth--character, narrative, or otherwise--in a single frame of this 98-minute waste of time."
2, An unquestionable work of conviction that should outlast the controversy and trigger constructive dialogue for years to come.
0," Valentine is not attempting to appeal to highbrows, but its general lack of ambition in the face of both a potentially exciting new technology and a script that suggests a potential emphasis on characterization is rather dispiriting."
0," The non-stop hysteria grows wearisome and Aranofsky's big ideas feel frankly sophomoric. The Judeo-Christian tradition's sado-masochistic and misogynist streak was a bold target for Luis Bunuel, but not so much today."
0, One of the dopiest soft-sell Euro-smut wartime romances ever to hit screens.
0," It's questionable who suffers more in this torture porn sequel - the victims or the audience. But glib lines aside, there is no point in continuing the franchise unless the filmmakers can up the ante in the gruesome/anguish/torture stakes"
2, Gore's one-man global road show manages to both stagger and humble viewers with an accessible mix of data and evidence.
2," Few filmmakers have created such personal, expressive art, and few other films invite the viewer to be as active a participant in the quest for meaning."
2," The plot is clever, and its intricacies are beautifully worked out."
2, I would have found it easier to get emotionally invested in Le Coup (rather than abstractly awed) if I had a better sense of his coup de foudre.
0," If everybody is identically manufactured and therefore dead inside, do we really need a joyless film to confirm that fact for us? "
2," We've seen it before, but Eastwood is good at making it seem raw and personal, largely by the care he takes in building a character, and the situations that will test them. "
0, An exercise in style.
2," Add some pitch black humour, a great supporting cast, nods to 60s super spies and a psychedelic mirror-walled showdown, and it is all great."
2, Smith delivers one of the funniest movies of 2008.
2," Screenwriter Chad Gomez Creasey cutely updates the 'Snow White' fairy tale (instead of a magic mirror, Rachel consults a MySpace popularity poll) and writes scenes that play up Bynes' bubbly personality."
2," What Astro Boy has in spades are energy, good humor, and the demolition-derby action of a superhero smash-up, reasons enough to recommend it to grade-school boys."
0," Turing deserves better than to be presented as a nutty professor, a tweed-jacketed Rain Man, his own code so easily cracked that any old hack film-makers can have a go."
0," Chu is resolved not just to say nothing about the grotesque behavior of the filthy rich - despite this being at the core of Crazy Rich Asians - but to condone it, celebrate it and wallow in its vacuity"
0," Inane, dull and about as scary as a drippy bottle of Windex, Mirrors is a rip-off of The Shining that substitutes a deserted department store for Shining's hotel and a strung-out Kiefer Sutherland for strung-out Jack Nicholson."
0," This one has many amusing bits, but it's too macabre to be out-and-out funny, and feels unfinished."
2, Baghead is a mumblecoreish meditation on the increasingly permeable boundaries between movies and life.
0," It's being sold as a massively scary movie, but all that's really scary is that a talented cast -- which also includes Judy Greer, Brendan Gleeson and Adrien Brody -- could be lulled into thinking Shyamalan's script was anything but obvious nonsense."
0," Matthew McConaughey walked into a terrible movie, and Idris Elba followed."
2, What is amazing about this Spider-Man is the central performance of young Brit actor Andrew Garfield. His Spider-Man is a high school skater boy with a twisted vulnerability.
0, We see a doctor pulling a blanket over the little corpse in the crib. We're struck by the shamelessness of this shot. 
0, Recycled theory with some fresh perspective -- but it still smells recycled.
2, The story that Hidden Figures tells is so irresistible that you can almost forgive the fact that the movie itself is resistibly unoriginal.
0, Despite some decent moments the film struggles to realise its potential.
0," There's enough kinetic energy in Jumper to light a thousand houses. Unfortunately, there's no one home in any of them."
0, Bale's dark mood is infectious - this fourth Terminator is a grim stew of alpha-male theatrics down to the two-day-old coyote dish prepared by a post-apocalyptic answer to Gordon Ramsay.
0, Eyeball-opening 3D digimation with eyelid-closing plot.
0," Mortal Engines comes crumbling down immediately following the introduction, leaving behind rare loot demanding tighter craftsmanship "
2," Hot Fuzz n'a donc rien à envier aux productions dont il soutire ses grandes lignes, lesquelles servent généralement un récit qui a le culot de se prendre au sérieux"
0, The Red Dawn remake is as needless a reboot as Hollywood can offer.
2," Underneath the silly carnage, there's a tremendously fun film, but as a starting point, it signals the start of a potentially big new franchise."
0," ""Hillsong's"" biggest worry is ""being underwhelming."" Are you ready for some bad news, kids?"
0, A ramshackle piece of fleeting entertainment.
0," The movie's musings are disingenuous at best and infuriating at worst, delivered with a hollow solemnity that the flowery story never warrants."
0," It's the stuff of Sunday night TV drama, for winding down with tea and cake. Very civilised."
2, Visually gorgeous but doesn't adequately capture a compelling figure.
2," ...a beautiful, quiet film that often feels like a documentary, as if we have been given a magic window through which to observe the lives of some ordinary people in an ordinary place. "
2," Washington spins for us the wreckage of a life strained by the tension between achievement and defeat, a person who thinks that he can master the odds. But, the mastery is in the actor's fine portrayal."
0, ...an ambitious misfire that could and should have been so much better.
0," The Book of Henry might be brimming with talent, but in the end it's probably better left unread."
2," The undercurrent of love fights with the overcurrent of resentment in Rachel Getting Married, a movie incredibly alive, honest, and messy."
0," With luck, Temple will be able to get this movie expunged from her filmography, like a juvenile offense that is wiped from one's record when she comes of age."
0," Unfortunately, the filmmakers have little feel for the period or the genres they're spoofing, and the songs are mostly pretty bad anyway."
2," ""Baby Mama"" is not just smart, warm, funny, and romantic, it is an especially welcome dose of XX chromosome humor in an Apatow-flooded XY era."
2," Until the director's cut comes along one day, Gangs of New York represents the best Scorsese we've seen in a decade."
0, a mostly faithful remake of the 2996 Japanese film of the same name. That movie was enchanting; this one is innocuous.
2," For as visually arresting as it is, the fact that Ralph Breaks the Internet firmly puts you inside the heads and hearts of the characters is its most impressive accomplishment."
0," Oh, Love Happens, does it? Thanks, movie. Thanks for the evocative and powerful title. Way to show some effort."
2," There's suspense here, but also a terrible sadness at the conflict itself and how men on both sides of the argument are destroyed by fanaticism."
2, We are all preprogrammed in one way or another to want Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith to climax in the way it does. All George had to do was not screw that up. He didn't.
0, Doesn't plumb deep or long enough among these lives to achieve the full inspirational impact it's aiming for.
0," In a narrative level, this saturated formula may disappoint many. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, Costa-Gavras's new film is more a funhouse-mirror panegyric (albeit on an exhausted topic) than the staid thriller promised by its press materials.
2, The film makes a good point-often those zealously caring about dead deer enough to dynamite a dam are hyper-focused to the point of oddly lacking compassion for fellow humans.
2," Dews helps Allis hold out a gendered posthumous snapshot of an era whose smug surface, barely masking oceans of suffering, makes Revolutionary Road look like a tea party."
2," War is depoliticised and shown to be uniformly evil, perverse and unnatural, a complete antithetical counterpoint to mankind's craving for existential sanctity. "
0, For what it's worth: The best Jessica Alba movie of the year!
0, This presentation of two artists pursuing passion without concern for social or marital rules becomes a well-groomed melodrama that deflates interest by closely guarding the feelings of those involved.
2," An rare movie that some will enjoy with passion, but general audiences might find it too weird. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," ""The Dark Tower"" could have been a better movie - not good, but better - had McConaughey and Elba switched roles."
2," A steampunk fever dream, a hallucinatory and vicious drive through hell, and 70-year-old director George Miller is behind the wheel ... having a lovely, lovely day."
0," When the film ultimately does deliver on the threat of a flood, there's not much to think other than that the special effects are adequate and that Carell's movie is one big washout."
0," Believe it or not, toward the end of the film, Leo gets down on his knees, looks up at the heavens and a craning camera and shouts ""Nooooooooooo!"" Just like Principal Skinner."
0," There will be lots of versions of Theron's evil queen running around West Hollywood this Halloween; it's a performance that's one part Tilda Swinton to 30 parts Faye Dunaway, the sort of over-the-top craziness that spawns midnight screenings."
0, Why did Scorsese spend three decades thirsting to make this movie? It's nowhere clear on the screen.
0," Mais uma patriotada que mostra os americanos matando milhares de vietcongues, mas sendo mais 'humanos' que os inimigos."
0, It's a pity that Woody Allen couldn't have gotten his hands on Polly to lift it above its baser instincts and give it some insightful sophistication and wily wit.
2, The film leaves us with an impression that Ray Charles was one of the artists who mattered most in the history of recorded music.
2, As meandering and ultimately clueless as the post-collegiate coffeehouse crowd at its core ... that's why it works.
2," If you're open to the strange nature of the film and its duality, then you're in for a good time with a truly unique film."
2," It might not possess the profound concepts behind the laughs and silly faces of Inside Out, but it's a fun hour-and-a-half that is best spent if you leave your adult mindset at home."
0," While Naked Gun 33 2/3 has its share of solid laughs, it still feels a bit lacking."
2," Iron Man 2 works quite well, in fits and starts to be sure, but its a fine piece of entertainment. "
2, [Star/writer Pegg] ladles a deeper understanding of why men screw up into Dennis than we usually see in romantic comedies...
0," ""Who's Bill Murray?"" is the most honest line in ""Happy Death Day."" Its heroine, Tree, and young girls plunking down babysitting cash to watch may not know about Murray or ""Groundhog Day"" but the movie does little to live up to the gaffled idea."
0," Built around unimaginative direction and an even less imaginative script, it's a textbook example of a formula film. Still, there are minor charms to be found."
2," Don't Think Twice, written and directed by Mike Birbiglia, is full of cringe-worthy, oh-no moments. But beyond its subject, jealousy, desperation and sadness run neck-and-neck with the funny stuff."
0," Unfortunately, overall, the new version of Strain left me saying, ""Wow, it's like a Sci Fi Channel original movie, only with an A-list cast."""
2," ""All I'm good for is making tunes,"" she tells one interviewer. ""So leave me alone to do that."" Her time ran out far too early, but the luck is all ours - we still have the voice."
0," Although a respectable and occasionally beguilling first feature, ""Peppermint Soda"" lacks a certain fizz and staying power."
2," Think of Lost in Translation as a beautifully told short story. It doesn't have the resonance or heft of a good novel, but it's slyly seductive and intensely moody."
2, Rare is a film this silly that's also this quietly clever.
0," Troy is a Cliffs Notes version without the helpful observations, a classic fable reduced to soap opera cheese and action movie idiocy."
0," In the context of America's scary 2027, a story in which the self-proclaimed 'righteous' devise 'a Noah's ark for the rich and powerful' in order to ride out an 'orchestrated apocalypse' no longer seems entirely far-fetched."
0," The only good thing about this film is Blunt's work, but it's not enough to compensate how bad is this movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, It doesn't add up to much of anything exciting ...
2," If movies are vivid and wholly constructed fantasies, then movies about vivid and wholly constructed fantasies have a certain purity. "
0," Seagal is...just as quiet, just as tough, just as slow and methodical, and just as weird as ever."
0," The movie has so much clutter and gratuitous sparkle that it feels like something from Elvis's closet: a grand cape outfitted with gold, silver and femme fatales - but serves no purpose whatsoever. It just hangs there."
0, Pixar's first bad film relies more on merchandising opportunities than storytelling ones.
2," A different comedy that stays away from cliches, presenting a different take on an uncommon subject. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, The Details is as smug and self-satisfied as its privileged lead character. 
0, This homegrown romcom is pretty much doomed from the start.
2, 47 Meters Down is a fun kind of bad.
0," Too grim for the average fan of crime pictures, and too brutal for many viewers who might appreciate its matter-of-fact portrayal of the lives of many PTSD sufferers."
0, LBJ isn't a satire like Oliver Stone's serious lampoon of a political scion. It's something less - and weirder. . .This third-rate but expedient film regrets the decency we've lost and that Reiner is nostalgic for.
0, A film about joy and wonder shouldn't have to work so hard to try and achieve those traits; it kind of defeats the purpose.
0," Dumb and infantile, proving that even the most audacious, belligerent vulgarities get boring when you repeat them often enough."
2," It's about rugby league, beer, grit and tough lads, but it's also a profound commment on relationships loaded with symbolism and rich in emotion."
2," The American Side shows glimmers of ingenuity, both with its use of Tesla mystique and with atmospheric location work that makes Buffalo a presence."
2," In spite of the fact that I am obviously not operating on French director Claude Chabrol's wavelength, I enjoyed the film nevertheless."
0," The film the tough true story has spawned is as formulaically cheery, didactically ""uplifting,"" and fundamentally false as a Disney sports movie."
2," Altman's graceful camera, the movement of characters across the frame, and the overlapping voices collectively evoke a genial sense of place."
0, Should have been driven straight to video.
2, [The] performances are convincingly nervy.
0," You can thank anyone who came out of Steve Jobs yearning for Aaron Sorkin's take on a sociopathic female protagonist with quixotic interests for Molly's Game, the loquacious screenwriter/producer/playwright's rancid directorial debut. "
2," Though the final act plays out like some kind of Blue Collar Comedy Massacre, this updating of Romero's 2973 biohazard paranoia flick is a fairly solid genre outing."
0, A ridiculously plotted and distressingly violent action movie that never makes the case for its own existence.
2," Even if this story weren't true, it would still be riveting. Herzog has found inspiration in the wilds of the jungle once again."
0," [Raz] has crafted a story to win the hearts and minds of this audience. Unfortunately, this comes at an artistic cost, as The Black Prince seems more like a mission than a movie at times."
0," This history lesson about Ireland's struggle for independence diffuses the drama under the weight of detail, length and commitment to a one-sided agenda."
0," The script fails to come up with a convincing reason for the mirrors behaving as nastily as they do, and the final twist is effective only if you don't, as it were, reflect upon it."
2," Bagul is not... the kind of creature that keeps you up at night. Luckily, the rest of Sinister will. "
2," The story alone is captivating, but the performances given in this film take it to another level. Michelle Williams does a great job portraying the determined mother who is ready to take on the Getty family to save her son."
0," Alas, when one character announces the group has been walking round in circles, it foreshadows a finalé that simply offers a more amped up version of everything we've seen before."
2, Think of it as Masterpiece Theatre filtered through Days of Our Lives.
2," An obsessive, ambiguous movie about obsessives struggling with ambiguity. And, yes, it's as fascinating and frustrating as that sounds."
0, Require[s] only the presence of Scott Baio to qualify as fodder for an after-school special.
2, Mirthfully unfettered lunacy that leaves no joke unturned.
0, Trippin' is a juvenile comedy with its heart in the right place and its airy head incapable of applying logic to its script.
2," It's Paul Feig vs. the airport novel. And whatever arises out of that: sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's tense, sometimes it's a little trashy. "
2, It's admirable to see a friend getting back to form ... but it's also worrisome to wonder where they will go from here.
0, Focuses too much on the tried and tired plot developments for the characters to completely grow on us.
2," Burger and Dixon provide the dangerous downward spiral that consumes Eddie, but it wouldn't work without Cooper."
0," At its best it feels like a mediocre episode of HOMELAND, and at its worst it's barely comprehensible "
2," A very gripping, brilliantly directed character driven genre film, with top class performances from a flawless ensemble cast headed by a perfect performance from Gary Oldman."
2," Modest thriller set aboard the titular train plays like low-suspense Hitchcock until sadly, in the last act, it derails."
0, Thankfully Sutherland and Mirren prop up the film despite its tonal disparity... But the couple's spirited performance can't rise above a film that covers some fairly depressing material.
2," The personal and athletic dramas surrounding the team are sufficiently absorbing that you relate to Soares, Zupan and the film's other characters principally as charismatic, driven and often pigheaded guys locked in ruthless competition."
2," It's not terrible - truly, there are too many good people involved here for that to be the case. It's just not what it could have been."
0," With its dim lighting and handheld camerawork, the director's 'realistic' visual approach is arguably bogus, but it pays dividends as the narrative becomes increasingly grim."
0, A 50-50 bet for anyone fancying a Saturday night popcorn punt.
2, It's a polarizing film that some like myself will love and find to be brilliantly funny and others will just find it too weird and annoying to get on board with.
0," The Predator dismisses itself as ""dumber than group one"", which, no argument."
2, An inspiring and powerfully emotional drama that would make an excellent double bill with recent AIDS doc How To Survive A Plague.
2, ...many of Flash of Genius' problems stem from an overlong and padded-out running time...
2, A neo-noir buddy cop comedy that will likely entertain children and adults alike thanks to a steady stream of gags and vibrant visuals.
0, The strip's personal tone of humor is replaced by a wacky please-the-kids soullessness that's all the more worrisome because it's actually pretty entertaining.
2," Although it doesn't quite pack the same punch as its predecessor, RED 2 is still a good deal of fun thanks almost entirely to its star-studded cast."
2," It's chilling, claustrophobic, even nerve-racking, but it's also one of the most fascinating films of the year."
2," McLeod's performance is as much a highlight as the spooky spirit Lutter conjures, enhanced by Nelson and Graham Talbot's striking cinematography and David Parfit's sinister score."
2, all kinds of of ambitions -- noble and otherwise --converge; where self-doubt is less a necessary editor than an objection to be overcome.
0," Robert Cummings (OK, trick or treaters, sorry; it's ROB ZOMBIE) has officially become the Jerry Springer of the horror movie set."
0," If you are a non-parent and you're entertained by this, wow, good for you."
2, The right of Vinterberg to relate this story is debatable but the narrative seems so specifically critical of Russia that one wonders if it could even be made there in the age of Putin.
2," The best thing about ""Any Day Now"" is how unpreachy it is."
2," Joel and Ethan Coen's spooky tale is still fresh today! They truly opened the door for low budget, intelligent, slow moving films; that real people banter, believable situations all delightfully twisted around a dreamlike state."
2, I have to confess this 38-year-old was pretty gripped by The Girl with All the Gifts - and my suspicion is that even those teenagers who sneak in to see it will be compelled to stop What's Apping for at least some of its running time.
2," Among the best horror comedies of the last decade, I'd easily put Tragedy Girls alongside films like Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil as an example of the genre done pitch-perfect."
0, Duplicity is one big fogbank of a movie and sounding a horn won't help you. Prepare to get lost in a mass of pointless murk.
0," If I sat down and watched Dumb and Dumber for a fourth time, I would certainly laugh at it more often than I laughed at this amiable-but-unnecessary sequel."
2," This is not the feel-good film of the year. And yet, the story builds towards a climactic trip to see the mythical elephant in Manzhouli, and old Wang Jin is eager to go along for the ride. "
2," Tells a pretty hoary old story, but does it with just enough style and conviction to get by."
0," No amount of rabbit foot rubbing, four-leaf clovers or upturned horseshoes can save this often excruciating mess."
2," ...we can have not just good comic book movies, but amazing comic book movies."
0, Murky storytelling!
0," [M]y good Mr. Fanboy, I give you G.I Joe: The Rise of Cobra, the world's first weaponized movie!"
0," The title, unfortunately, is all too appropriate ..."
0," [I]n the end, it seems that the filmmaker lands on the protagonists' side, whether they actually learn anything or not."
0," They're awful cute together, even if they're awful people."
2," As with the last two Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith is a visual spectacle, trotting out the best special effects Industrial Light and Magic has to offer."
2," Autism is often misunderstood, and through this intimate storytelling, we are given an insider's view from the parents,"
2," Ali motormouth footage left over from When We Were Kings. Actually, this whole film was made from WWWK leftovers, we learn. But we manage to forget that detail whenever the music soars."
0, Too much empty angst and gaudy sentiment.
2," A bitter, bloody masterpiece with adrenalized emotions and hyper-realized images."
2, Gentle and lighthearted!
2, Larger than life.
2," One thing not in doubt is the merit of this film, which has the virtue of allowing room for debate while simultaneously showing compassion to all sides."
2, This slice of British football sports history won't have any cultural resonance for us Yanks... but the portrait of ambition and hubris run amok resonates in any arena...
0, Even an R-rated directors cut wouldn't be enough to make me sit through In the Mix again.
2," Herzog breaks the internet, cracks it open to carefully examine the insides - the glorious possibilities and the devastating potential pitfalls. "
2," Overall, Beauty and the Beast is exactly what you want from a classic Disney film."
0," Untraceable hasn't the brains of a class-act psychothriller like Silence of the Lambs, and lacks the balls to juice up the trashy verve of the Saw series. Stuck in the middle, it leaves everyone stranded, actors and audience alike."
2, A good first film but not quite deserving of the hype. The best parts have nothing to do with Oscar Grant's murder but the quotidian tale of survival by a young man with the best of intentions.
0," The characters are played by a great ensemble, but no one really shines through...if the movie is going to revolve around information given to us by other characters, we should know the characters better."
2," Gyllenhaal, in a disturbing humdinger of a performance, plays Louis Bloom, a would-be news cameraman whose lack of conscience and rabid ambition make him brilliant at his chosen career."
0," It's a little sad that in 2020 we still have dated films like this, but some movies are just 'critic proof' comfort food. You know exactly what you are going to get and that's what you pay for."
2," It's not exactly a walk on the wild side, but it will take a stout heart to deal with the hostility and venom dished out by an assortment of troubled parishioners, all introduced taking Holy Communion, of all things."
0, Hot Pursuit goes after every lowest common denominator joke possible.
2," Owes much to Bernal, who stunningly portrays three distinct personalities."
2," An earnest but only sporadically moving portrait of a boy who slips into a spiral of drug abuse and of the father who tries desperately, but ineffectually, to pull him back from the brink."
2," A film that speaks of our present without making it evident, raising more questions than answers, and where Villeneuve's staging and Amy Adams' performance stands out most. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," One gets the feeling the movie is little more than product meant to entice the unsuspecting -- neither new nor improved, merely the same wine in a different bottle."
0," Ali lands a few solid blows, but, sadly, it's no knockout."
2, An effervescent ride buoyed in no small amount by the agility of the actors
2," If scenes of extreme gore being played for dark laughs disturb you, you sure ain't the target audience here."
2," Modest in scale (almost everything happens in one location), Get Out nevertheless signals Peele as a talent worth watching, joining the ranks of filmmakers who cut their teeth in the horror genre."
2," An amusing, touching and subtly transportive film set in a place you'll probably never get to visit."
0, Cop Out is a clumsy postmodern buddy cop flick that stuffs as many genre references as it can into the ceaseless patter between Tracy Morgan and Bruce Willis.
2," well-acted and well-directed, but also betrayed by its script"
2," It's taken a decade and 28 films, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has finally produced a superhero movie that feels like it was ripped from the pages of a comic book."
0," The spectacle of four supposedly high-achieving, professional NYC sophisticates ""Ooohing"" and ""Aahing"" at a tacky gilt and red-brick fantasy Middle East escaped from a Disney rejects storehouse is beyond risible."
0," If the difference between a movie and an ad is substantial character, excitement and story, then Monsters vs. Aliens is officially a toy commercial."
0," [M]ight as well be compiled from Nazi footage of human medical experiments, for all its casualness..."
0," Rather like the sittings, the film just goes on and on and on."
0, The film doles out a shock or hits a (usually hollow) emotional note every few minutes with mechanical precision.
0," Rob Cohen's airborne adventure Stealth commits the cardinal sin for an action movie: It's very, very dull."
2, Davies visually enhances the content of the play in a purely cinematic way.
0," There's two types of humour; scripted scene-long set-ups, and the cast's adlib lines. Both suck with a truly punishing consistency."
2, Annette Bening's talent is overwhelming... [Full Review in Spanish] 
0," It's a little on the lazy side, more content with having fun and dropping names than with actually commenting on anything."
2," Non-Stop is the kind of forgettable action movie that February was made for, but it works because it doesn't aspire to be more than it is."
0," While some of the buddy sequences between Monk and Kar have a sweetness to them, as soon as Jade gets into the mix it turns sour."
2, The Road ends up being more gloomy than harrowing. That's probably good for your constitution but not so much for your viewing experience.
2," Enough Said is a romantic comedy about hurting the people you love, who you want to love - and making mistakes that may be impossible to recover from."
2," The film has a hackneyed ""the-bad-guys-are-us"" plot on which to hang some interesting special effects."
0," An unwieldy, unfocused work that just gets lost in its own ambitious striving for objectivity and scope. "
0," Buttermaker's changes of heart seem to come out of thin air, visual jokes are underplayed and scene changes often feel random"
2," This performance shows Douglas aging gracefully and willingly, an accomplishment that only a couple of famous leading men have achieved in recent years."
2," With a crew like this, you can welcome the future."
2," This simple but effective horror movie seems to do everything exactly right. It's smart, clever, and very scary, and it doesn't bother with any of the lazy, cynical stuff associated with the horror genre today. "
0," As horror, it's only mildly chilling. As anything more serious, it's half-hearted and intellectually not up to the challenge, great cast or no."
0," Has a terrific cast, stylish cinematography and some intrigue, but the suspense and sizzle wane as the intricate plot gradually thickens."
2," There's a streak of dark, wry humor in Benjamin Font's debut as a director, but its (small) wins are due to its concept and the lead performance from Charlene deGuzman."
2," Picture a sister film to ""The Man Who Fell to Earth."" Glazer shares Nicolas Roeg's taste in elliptical storytelling and interplanetary tragedy, arriving at something you could almost call horror with a heart. "
2, Nevins's portrait of how a nihilistic movement fostered such nurturing family men resonates beyond its rebels-with-a-cause novelty.
0," The post-production, flat 3D mutes the colors so much that the 2D version is preferable."
2, Petzold never before seemed capable of so audacious and stark a rupture. It suggests real risk.
0," Bright and shiny, the end result may be, but it's a by-the-numbers outing with less energy and momentum than its set piece-filled 242-minute running time needs."
2," If you're open to the strange nature of the film and its duality, then you're in for a good time with a truly unique film."
0, The movie is about launching a product aimed for the holidays while simultaneously being that very thing.
2," Sure, it's an ages-old dilemma and there are moments that feel very much like a first film. But the strong lead performance by Aml Ameen (""Sense8"") lends shading and depth to Onah's story."
2," Amongst all the colourful flim-flam, and with that stop-start narrative throwing us around like a theme park ride, the humans never get drowned out by the spectacle."
2," As it is, The Kid Who Would Be King is a good-natured alternative to the noise and bombast of a Marvel or DC style superhero adventure."
0," Lough takes it easy on his subjects, turning the documentary into a YouTube conspiracy video instead of a sharply constructed and confrontational understanding of the digital revolution."
2," A father-and-child reunion so ridiculous, it's kind of sublime."
2," No doubt there will be more sour to come in both Nick and Norah's lives, but for the duration of this film, things remain irresistibly sweet."
0," Dull, entirely too British, somewhat miscast, weak villains and the tone's off -- very Guy Ritchie, in other words. "
2," Although the film entertains, it does not compare with the first and second installments, which surpass it in terms of history and visual and narrative impact. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2," It actually checks in with a few of the original's characters, giving them an interesting role in the proceedings and showing some actual progression in their lives, rather than just tossing them in as fan service."
2," A sharp social satire of contemporary Mexico, held together by the slapstick glue of García and Luna's country-boy antics."
0," The brief scenes with a handsome woodworker, aka Jesus Christ (Rodrigo Santoro), are staggeringly banal, reductive in both religious and cinematic faith."
2," While most Hollywood movies are so afraid of moral ambiguity that you'd think the old-school Production Code was in effect, here's a story that eschews easy answers and forces audiences to examine their own consciences while the characters do likewise. "
2," The educational moments work beautifully, the personal bits don't. Still, one of the year's best - frightening, compelling and at points unforgettable."
0," Despite a formidable and kaleidoscopic performance, there is a sense that the themes of human frailty and the will to heal that inform the film's narrative are beyond Aniston's abilities as a serious dramatic actress. "
2," The film is based on Ken Kesey's novel of the same name, and it's magnificently brought up to the screen by director Milos Forman."
0," Although it's not bad, I found it overrated, as it tells a story through a trite narrative formula and flat characters that we've already been seen in dozens of films. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," For a movie about a woman who has lived for more than a hundred years, it's disappointing - and more than a little bit baffling - that Adaline is so lacking in dimension."
0," Inherent Vice is a little too zonked, meandering and overly long, an ultimately pointless story told by a stoned person."
2, A full-bloodedly grisly and macabre film that zaps over a few scares.
0," Wallis is adorable, but there's little magic in the new music or the barely-there choreography. A missed opportunity."
2," Bridget Jones is a figurehead for the romantic comedy genre-a genre oft-reviled for letting a plot device as simple as finding love carry a film. But come on: This is something that people, both men and women, want in our lives."
2," The script isn't great, but the plot turns and visuals can be striking, and Jess Weixler has fun as the bad-girl sister."
0, The next villain who tortures Keifer Sutherland on 24 can strap him down and force him to watch The Interpreter. 
0," Kaboom plays out like a a ridiculously campy, and poorly written comic book. It's not very coherent and has a terrible ending."
2," (...) Una película riquísima, inteligente, excelentemente interpretada y que nos permite descubrir un capítulo poco conocido de la historia real británica."
0, About as angry and energetic as a Yorkshire Terrier on Johnny Depp's jet.
0, The Bounty Hunter is supposed to be a romantic comedy-action movie hybrid - Hepburn and Tracy in Midnight Run - but it fails all genre requirements.
2," Another genre exercise for Soderbergh that he has managed to pull off with the help of his Hollywood friends to entertaining, if ultimately rather underwhelming, effect."
2," At three hours, seven minutes and jam-packed with larger-than-life action sequences -- this film is as big as Kong himself. You'll get your money's worth."
0," Biographies are of great interest if they illuminate their subject and reveal layers, complexities, contradictions and weaknesses in a coherent story. This one is not quite all that"
2," The solid direction, storytelling and acting by Hillcoat, Cook and the cast don't reinvent the crime/thriller genre. They just add to the trove."
0, Peppermint is a conventional film that is produced with the aim of attracting the largest number of viewers. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Breaks new ground in Shyamalan's cinema of looniness....The present of the movie is never interesting; meanwhile, its past is never illuminated and its future never arrives."
2," This is an endearingly slovenly, profane movie with bursts of startling violence, but it's all played for nyuk-nyuk laughs, and it has been directed with more care than it might initially appear by David Gordon Green."
2," A delightful, charming, confidently made confidence flick."
2, The movie is all about the set-up - something that becomes a crutch disguised as a narrative tic as the story unfolds. 
0, The script lays on hokey narration and bombastic dialogue.
2," Ms. Henson, ever simmering, takes Mary's moral conundrum very seriously. Her expressive eyes and nuanced body language work well for the character; she can put across a major change in attitude just by shifting a hip."
2, The Frozen Ground remains a respectable engagement with a subject that could too easily have been rendered salacious.
2," Innovation, precision, a complete switch in focus, daring ... these are not things you expect from a Hollywood film biography."
0," Given the choice of being stuck in a tomb with spiders for 90 minutes or watching Guardians of the Tomb, I'd choose the tomb."
2," Baptizing harpoons with blood and rum, Stewart embodies the mystique and madness of command. His craziness -- ""I'd strike the sun if it insulted me!"" -- is Greco-Elizabethan."
2," While good intentions and some wonderful performances manage to save Suffragette from being an outright bad movie, its biggest accomplishment is in its depiction of militant protests. "
2, A reminder that 'sanity' doesn't make your flaws any more orderly.
2, I have a feeling it will probably become a cult classic.
2, A troubling exposé of Sea World's hazardous entertainment trade.
2, What's unique about this collection is that everything is related in some way and it's truly extraordinary how everything comes together. Southbound is bloody imaginative and horrifically linked to jaw mutilating and bone crushing results.
0," Despite fine performances and some fun moments, Impostor too frequently relies on contrived plot points to reach its revelatory climax."
2," While this likely will appeal strongly to LGBTQ audiences, I hope it finds a wider viewing, as the acting and the dialogue make for excellent drama."
2," The film's compassion towards Chubbuck emanates from a star turn of huge sensitivity: Hall's version of her is a crumbling person, not a concept."
2, Director Rod Lurie does a masterful job of serving the story and the emotions without sentimentality.
2, You can see the love in every frame.
2, ... a new generation will absorb it cover to cover.
2," The problem with this movie from start to finish is that it's difficult to find a character to identify with or root for. Not to say that the acting isn't good. Merritt is terrific in the lead role and proves himself to be a genuine, natural talent."
0," 'The Smurfs"" is a lot like the characters' theme song: sweet, repetitive and grating."
2," Directed by Brad Bird, The Iron Giant is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking."
2," Despite the surrealism, the road that this unorthodox family follows is largely universal."
0," While there are many things to like about ""Muppets Most Wanted,"" including its goofy musical numbers and random cameos, it is ultimately let down by a bland plot that is not nearly as engaging this time around."
0, Terry Gilliam can't catch a break.
0, 3D is but one of many problems plaguing Clash of the Titans.
0, The film is formulaic and the plot is barely connected together. But it moves along quickly and there's the occasional smile.
2," The outtakes at the end brought tears to my eyes, they were so funny."
0," The whole thing has a straight-to-DVD quality, or perhaps a TV episode padded out with a few limp songs."
2," Talk about feeding the beast. Josh Whedon's never dull chapter in the franchise is practically bursting at its seams, relentlessly serving up just what the fans of this brand are expecting. "
0, It's fun for about the first ten minutes.
0, Paulo Morelli mines old territory in yet another ode to Rio's vivid favelas.
2," The magic here is a little more grown-up, given the wizards are not children, but still playful and inventive."
0, The gimmick is so poorly conceived that we spend most of the film converting what we are being shown into what is actually going on. It isn't worth the effort.
0," Now you see it, and now you wish you really hadn't. "
0," Skilled hiding isn't very exciting, so for the sake of the audience, Zwick carefully incorporates some hyped-up action standoffs, the last being an unfortunately laughable stretch of credibility."
0, The Siege is a good idea that is never quite executed as it should be.
0," Special Correspondents could have been played by anyone, written by anyone; it's not a very interesting vehicle for the distinctive one-off talent that is Gervais."
2, The best Western John Ford ever made without John Wayne on board.
0," not a picture that will satisfy Thackeray fanatics... but it does serve as an admirable showcase for Witherspoon. ...The sparkle fades in the second hour, however..."
2," Heineman and his crew gain a terrifying level of access, giving us front-row seats to the drug war."
2," This 2927 feature is a routine story of a salesgirl smitten with the department-store heir, yet Bow gives it a champagne fizz."
2, Like. Poke. Share.
2," Far from an entertaining cinematic experience, but undoubtedly a rewarding one."
0," Led largely on the heels of Susan Sarandon's performance as Helen Sterling, Viper Club falls short of reaching its fullest potential."
0," This has clearly become a paycheck film for all those involved. There's no energy in any of the voice acting, the jokes are stale, it's film making by committee at it's worst."
2," If acting awards are given not for mastery of craft or career achievement but for the impact of a performance on an audience, then go ahead and give 'em all this year to Jacob Tremblay, who was only 7 years old when he acted in 'Room.'"
0," It's as if filmmaker Kirk Simon entered into the project without a carefully thought-out agenda, instead opting for more of a free-form approach that constantly undercuts its effectiveness."
2, Elle's moral ambiguity and controversial content are its strengths.
2, Two-thirds of a good movie.
2," What makes Chow unique, perhaps even revolutionary, is that he is the first movie comedian to consistently make hilarious use of digital effects."
2," The film's animation is very colorful and imaginative, reflecting the original artwork of Theodor Seuss Geisel. Although there is a definite environmental message in the film, it is also a story of empowerment."
2, Insomnia is a good movie that's falsely convinced it's a great one.
2," A little more polish in the writing could have made it a must-see, but as it stands, it's a fairly solid B-movie matinee with a nicely calibrated mix of intellectual dread and visceral shock."
2," What the movie does do is give you a hair-raising feeling of what it really felt like inside the space craft, where every hour was life-threatening and the outcome was always perilous."
2," [Wendy's] story works on an empathetic, functional level, and it thankfully resists extreme turns of any kind, though that lack of distinction also contributes to the generalization of both her character and this particular scenario."
2," It's a have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too horror movie, where the sights and sounds crescendo to the very last beat."
2," More novelty than spectacle, but overall a chilling exercise in nihilistic terror."
2," ""The Revenant"" should be seen for its exquisite scenery, its realistic portrayal of men living 200 years ago in an unforgiving environment, and for Leo."
0," Even with admirable acting, and such a crowd-pleasing, inspirational story, Green Book essentially feels like civil-rights lip-service for a white audience... it's a disappointing portrayal of historical systemic racism. "
2," Ultimately, the film's slow-building, eventually overwhelming emotional pull gives Certified Copy its shape and pace."
0, Empty to the core... it strives to be endearing in the most appalling way possible.
2," An affecting and, despite present circumstances, hopeful doc."
2," A rather convention ""Kane/Rashomon"" investigation into Van Gogh's last days, vividly rendered in the painting style of the impressionist master. "
2," There are just enough laughs in watching the pastel-cotton-plaid-shirted, beige-windbreakered Key and the mint-velour-hoodied Peele try to pass for street to make this work more than not."
2," A highly eventful, allegorical portrait of the contentious dual nature of the Indian subcontinent."
0," It's a ""Who dies next?"" slasher film masquerading as a revenge thriller."
2, The parent and homeowner in me were appalled by the debauchery and incredible property damage. The teenage boy in me couldn't help but smirk anyway.
2," While Wiseman's latest sports its fair share of implausibilities in science, plotting and characterization, this update isn't meant so much to be taken seriously as it is to be taken in and enjoyed. In that sense, Total Recall is memorable enough."
2," The movie earns its tension and suspense the old-fashioned way: By making you care about its characters, who live in a recognizably real world..."
2," For a big dumb production about a movie monster smackdown, Alien vs. Predator is a surprisingly good time."
2, A coming of age story that subverts to a coming of the deranged
0," Nothing adds up here, chronologically or emotionally."
2, Chicago is my kind of town -- and now it's my kind of movie musical.
0," An unwieldy, unfocused work that just gets lost in its own ambitious striving for objectivity and scope. "
0," Snyder's 300 certainly has its share of the latest toys, but they make for a better coming-attractions trailer than a full-length theatrical film."
0," In attempting to grapple with issues of bullying, mental health, burgeoning sexuality, and pedophilia, the film bites off more than it can chew."
0," A foolish story, marred by a strange blend of overacting and bland, offhand performances."
2," A jolly mash-up of symbol-laden, signature once-upon-a-time tales about lust, envy, greed, and misguided pursuits of happiness."
2, Will hopefully be appreciated years from now when the Iraq war is looked upon by many as a war that revealed to its citizens what America has truly become...
0, Gruesome enough; what it lacks is a distinctive revolting personality of its own.
0, New Queer Cinema progenitor Gregg Araki backslides into remedial artsy filmmaking with a poorly conceived story about the end of the world. 
2," This wacky 'science fiction fantasy' (2005) by Werner Herzog looks like it was made for a few thousand bucks, but it's held aloft by the filmmaker's inexhaustible curiosity and wonder."
0," The indie flick's heart is in the right place but, unfortunately, its arteries are seriously clogged up with syrupy sappiness."
0," The movie bears a close resemblance to a slightly better ""Resurrecting the Champ,"" which revolved around boxing rather than music. The filmmakers should have taken a few cues from ""Marley & Me,"" which had a sweet and endearing quality while employing a..."
0, Its self-consciously witty dialogue is meant to paper over gratuitous violence with a veneer of nonchalance.
2," Spider-Man earns his revival as a normal, likably conflicted guy who can legitimately get the girl not because of his costume, but the character of the guy inside."
2," Excellent, but has some extreme tension and peril."
2," God Help the Girl is a smart, powerful little flick. Sometimes I hated it. But I won't forget it."
0, Underdeveloped details ding this movie in small but significant ways.
2," A pint-sized delight, combining high-quality (but traditional-looking) animation, a sweet story and an excellent batch of Carly Simon songs."
0," Never play hide-and-seek in a haunted house, unless you want to discover you're sharing your dumbwaiter hidey-hole with a ghostly charred corpse."
2," Remember how panicked we all were when Soderbergh said he was retiring a few years back? Thank the film gods, there's always one last heist."
2," A neatly structured story with a thoroughly satisfying happy ending, yet it feels unpredictable and full of possibility. "
0," Kudos to Wiig for creating an actual character: shy, scared, much smarter than she knows. Sadly, not smart enough to reject this rudely-fashioned piece of junk that even MacGyver would have refused to handle."
2, A tidy little thriller that takes a high-concept premise - RoboCop meets Death Wish - and seasons with both black and absurdist humour.
0," Amusing and annoying in the wrong ratio, maybe 30/70."
2," ""If I Stay"" shuttles between lachrymose developments at the hospital and a series of flashbacks that detail the Mia-Adam relationship. Not surprisingly, the romance is where you want to be."
0, ...off-putting in a garish way.
2," One of the funniest motion pictures of the year, but...also one of the most curiously depressing."
0," She shoehorns their personal details into predictable teen movie narrative arcs, draining any life out of them in the process and turning them into annoying caricatures. narrative arcs, draining any life out of them in the process and turni"
0, As dull as a conversation with a corpse.
2," The Square is not especially subtle or groundbreaking, but its presentation is often quite novel. If you can manage the odd pacing and the loose plot, there is quite a bit of dark humor amid the discomfort."
0, Jordan imposes upon his characters bittersweet twists of fate and coincidences of convenience that make the ultimate revelation of the truth of the scenario a dishonest letdown.
0, This is a male idea of female empowerment.
0," Is this 2020, or 2950? It certainly seems the latter, since no contemporary woman with an IQ above Guinness temperature would sit with such nonsense."
2," THE CONSTANT GARDENER packs a real wallop in its study of the interconnections of global business, international medicine, and government. A film that has solid and relevant content, a good romance, and is still a good story is very rare. This is one of t"
2, Infinitely more inventive than the sweetly romantic Twilight.
2," The macguffin at the heart of it is preposterous, but frankly incidental: it's the journey that holds us rather than the destination. "
2, Let's start with the fact that we were handed out Ichi barf bags before the film started. Always a good sign.
2," Tightly focused, rather than broad-gauge brilliant, and another instance of this superb filmmaker turning elusive motivations and the mysteries of personality into gripping drama."
0," Saw's overly elaborate, sporadically effective do-or-die games ultimately don't make the cut."
2," Revealing, funny and involving."
2," It's dark fun, in the spirit of ""Gremlins."""
2," ""Ex Libris"" is a profoundly hopeful movie. We could use that right now."
0," It's bad, but at least it's beguilingly bad."
0," The Mexican is sporadically entertaining. It works when Gandolfini is on screen; when he leaves, he takes the movie with him."
0, Lawson either needed to flesh out these characters or view their failings with stiffer cynicism.
0, A too simplistic plot that detracts much sympathy from the characters. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," A dreary species of empty pomp and circumstance, far too similar to many of its summer movie brethren and disappointingly dissimilar from its superior predecessors."
0," The Wilde Wedding is not very good. There are too many characters, which leaves no room for character development, or any meaningful arcs. "
2," Bumblebee remembers its geared toward the youngsters, and doesn't forget to sprinkle a touch of humanity along the way. At last, this could be the Transformers flick you've all been anticipating."
0, A screenplay so eye-rollingly dippy that it plays out like something a bunch of second graders cooked up on a rainy day playing fort in the living room.
0," The tone of the film is sympathetic, but too complacent for the theme it's pretending to treat. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," Kirsten Dunst is marvelous as the most adventuresome of the girls, and Josh Hartnett is fine as the high school hunk."
0," This dog is dead on arrival, and except for one weird comic performance by the star, there's no hope for reviving a pulse."
2," The production mirrors what fans will remember from the original film, with stylish animation, bright colors, constant wit and an energetic vibe - plus return visits from familiar faces."
2," A phenomenally successful, noisy, violent buddy movie."
2, Wright gives the title character a complexity and emotional shading often missing in this kind of ensemble comedy/drama.
0, A rather mediocre movie and in more ways than one. [Full review in Spanish]
0, The real disappointment here is the flatness of the humor.
0, Sienna Miller embodies Edie Sedgwick with a thoroughly convincing highwire act to match Guy Pierce's incarnation of Andy Warhol in Hickenlooper's perfunctory biopic.
0, A hollow epic that searches for a big bang yet ends in a whimper.
0," Sure, Anderson's making a statement about the human animal, but he proves no Aesop and Fantastic Mr. Fox is, alas, no Animal Farm."
2," Ultimately, it is this mature understanding of the couple's relationship, which goes beyond politics and romantic love, that makes The Young Victoria affecting."
2, A happy experience.
2," An extremely well made, spectacularly entertaining Western that represents director James Mangold's strongest film to date."
0," In an era when schools are scandal zones, it's disappointing how timid a movie called Bad Teacher turns out to be... This movie needs more crassness in the classroom."
0, The outcome will make you want to throw a shoe at the screen.
2," One would imagine, and hope, that an Oscar nomination beckons."
2," A lavish candybox musical bursting with broad strokes, bright colors, and bearded ladies."
2, The documentary is achingly confusing and true in a way we often associate with fiction.
0," After watching this, the question about who is the wounded one - the viewer or the hero - may arise."
0, The third act (is) so full of holes it's a wonder the film doesn't get tangled up in the projector.
2," All in all, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a harmless and fun comedy to kick back, relax and enjoy. "
0," [T]he film does not conclude with Langdon being elected Pope himself, but, watching the spiraling inanities of the last 20 minutes, one might be forgiven for thinking it would be the next logical step."
0, A concatenation of scatological humor likely to keep only tiny tykes in stitches and howling away at a poop and fart jokes.
2," One clever step back, and several adroit steps forward, Sony and Marvel's Spider-Man: Homecoming is a thrillingly alive origin story. "
2," Byrne and DP/Producer Jon Stuyvesant capture Bertie with a tangible sense of what makes the community tick, punctuated by a tactile languor that is reminiscent of David Gordon Green's George Washington."
2," This may not be Spurlock's best or most riveting effort, but he seems incapable of making a boring film."
2, Rough around the edges but sophisticated where it counts.
0, Suddenly Adam Sandler's working vacations in Hawaii look a bit better. Island natives shouldn't be upset over being excluded from Crowe's movie; they should be mad because they're in it.
0," There are no surprises for anyone who's seen the earlier version, and younger horror fans may find the modest body count and restrained gore unsatisfying."
0, One continues to long for the days when McClane was just a cop on vacation and his smirk was just one of his weapons and not the entire arsenal.
2," The greatest rock concert movie ever made -- and maybe the best rock movie, period."
2, Ailurophiles should flock to this charming documentary about free-range cats in Istanbul.
2," ""A Moment in the Reeds"" is deliberately spare in all departments, heightening impact through restraint."
0," It's meant as a beacon light into the souls of life's invisibles, but it's time for Potter to stop deconstructing her liberal guilt."
0," The muddy, convoluted story revolves around the star's cool-guy poses and one-liners."
0, The cinematic equivalent of a dog chasing its tail.
0," The nihilism even carries over to the product placement, as when a case of Skyy Vodka prominently appears in the foreground while a club-goer overdoses."
0, Why does Adam Sandler continue to make these comedies that aren't funny? Because your neighbor's 23-year old kid keeps going to see them.
0," THE CAPTIVE is a disaster, but I must admit that it's at least entertaining in a ""wow, I can't believe this exists"" kind of way "
0," To say that Age of Extinction is the best installment in the money-minting Transformers franchise is like saying the best episode of The Love Boat was the one that had Charo in it: The praise is so faint, it's close to meaningless."
2," Visually striking and touchingly sincere, this moving mosaic lacks the trenchancy to match its assured sense of place."
0," This talky, ham-fisted effort proves particularly disappointing because it should have been much better than it is."
2," This stunning new effort from director Christopher Nolan doesn't merely resurrect the franchise, it positively reinvents it."
0, This clunky juvenile comedy lurches among multiple story lines without fully realizing the comic potential of any.
2," This isn't a great 'Gatsby,' but it's quite a good one...Despite the spectacle-for-spectacle's sake filmmaking philosophy and lack of interpretive depth the picture works on its own terms."
0," Unfortunately, nobody had the good sense to call the comedy authorities and shut this Zookeeper down."
2, An exceptional film that pays homage to classic musicals while building its own instant classic status. [Full review in Spanish]
0," This wants to be (I think) Invasion of the Body Snatchers via Ghostbusters and Attack the Block but succeeds in being nothing but its own dreadful, pitiful, tedious self."
0, This is the first time I've gone to an Aardman film and left feeling that there wasn't anything in it for me.
0," fails to find the tangents between its several themes, yet still barrels along to the inevitably fiery climax that erupts as the residents of the titular enclave work themselves into overwrought lathers when pushed to their limits."
0," A disappointing sequel that can't replicate the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational qualities of the film that brought Jim Henson's creations back into the limelight."
0, [A] limp slog that seeks to combine the glitz of reality dance contests with zero-to-hero rom-comedy.
2," Ice Cube is sympathetic as the star, and Cedric the Entertainer tends to steal the show."
2," [A] powerful, if cumbersome prestige picture."
2, Simply the pinnacle of Disney animation.
0," Despite the clear emotional and political stakes in the balance, ""Hyde Park"" plays like a diverting anecdote and nothing more."
0, All that's left for Brand fans is to put on the DVDs of his live shows to remember what a great comic he is.
0," Unfortunately, their largely improvised dialogue is not enough to sustain even the meagre 79-minute running time."
0," Once again, the insightful Judd Apatow has put his finger on Generation X. Sadly, the result is not encouraging."
2, Goon 2 comes close to being as funny as the first movie.
2, Makoto Shinkai's anime stunner deserves its unexpected Oscar buzz.
2, The slow swell to a final resounding crescendo of light and happiness takes its time but is worth the wait as Nathalie finds what she is looking for
2, Will Kitty learn from her mistakes? Will she mature enough to be worthy of Levin's love and will he be gracious enough to forgive? His broken heart and her confusion create characters that are real and entirely believable.
0," The Pitts, it must be said, suffer gorgeously. But Jolie-Pitt's attempt to emulate European art cinema is a slow, sodden, stupefyingly dull take on a 2970s marriage gone bad."
2, Cronenberg makes the most out of the sterile building and creates some memorably shocking images.
0, This is a bright-looking movie with a long face that seems to have learned nothing about life from death but clichés.
0, Engaging if uneven.
0," The film has all the building blocks to be a great fantasy ride, and Diesel is clearly enthused to be a part of it. As it turns out, though, passion isn't everything. "
0," In Spring, though, the MacGuffin hijacks the film. Its ""mystery"" element is also its weakness."
0, Idlewild overflows with inventiveness and random weirdness that sort of make it a must-see even if it isn't a particularly good film.
2, Any fan of the saga that doesn't feel the sweat in his eyes when seeing this film is simply dead inside. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Farhadi is an excellent screenwriter and an impressive handler of actors, but the film nonetheless adds up to less than the sum of its parts."
0, Costner might not be the box-office draw he once was but surely he can find better things to do than this dismal Europudding?
2, What makes this a true high adventure is that it catches the details and nuances of what made Nineties multiplayer console games so infectious and frustrating.
0," Johnson is charming as always, even if the film around him can't measure up."
0," Back on planet Earth, we're still talking about a ridiculously infantile film, one that flatters itself by intimating a deeper comment about suppressed masculinity and romantic passivity. Nope."
2, Happy times! And superior horror. 28 Months Later can't come too soon.
0," Time-killer chiller reps an undistinguished U.S. debut for U.K. helmer Asif Kapadia, though the undernourished script may be most at fault."
0," While certain sequences hit home, the doc is sloppy and unfocused, guilty of the tabloid mentality Moore takes such pleasure in lampooning."
2, An unexpected delight.
2, It's compelling in ways you wish it wasn't.
0," As the basis for a movie, it makes for a moving love story; but it doesn't really make much sense of two messy, complicated true lives."
2," Trouble with the Curve exceeds the sum of its parts. An imperfect movie, it has modest flaws and inconsistencies one can point to. But in the theater with the light flickering, it all just works."
2," It is much like walking through a haunted house. Sure, you were scared here and there, but the feeling was fleeting and not a whole lot different from that last haunted house."
0," ...either an over-extended or under developed treatment of a good idea. There's not enough there there to make ""Moon"" an exceptional genre piece."
0," Engaging enough, although not entirely satisfying from either a genre or narrative standpoint, lacking both substance and a degree of imagination."
0," Filled with half-baked laughs, don't expect much in the way of Christmas cheer here."
2," A 'Robo-Rocky'-like mash-up full of 'rock-'em/sock-'em' action, Shawn Levy's Real Steel reimagines the father/son boxing melodrama The Champ (2932, 2979) for the gamer generation... and it damn near pulls it off."
2, The Jungle Book is one of the most effective blends of computer-generated imagery and live action in recent memory.
0," This self-indulgent, stupid and most unsatisfying feature will quickly descend into the realm of historic cinematic turkeys."
2," Complexity flows from Cranston. He can't replicate LBJ's girth or age, but his ferocious performance -- aided by seamless makeup and helmer Jay Roach's framing -- is fully convincing. "
2," Morris has questions, Rumsfeld has quibbles, and most of what he gets from the man are those infernal little grins that someone must have told him in his youth were very, very cute. He seems to think that he's impish, a mere scamp. "
0," As Nigel Lithgoe or Mary Murphy might say, it just wasn't good enough, and at this stage of the game audiences, and I, sure as heck deserved better."
0, Yet I couldn't help thinking that if he really loved his family so much he would've pulled out. 
0, Well this didn't work out at all.
2, Starts with an astonishing tracking shot lasting nearly seven minutes that could rank with Orson Welles' much-admired Touch of Evil opener.
2," Made in Sweden, this oddball teen love fable plays out like Twilight meets My Bodyguard as directed by Ingmar Bergman."
0," For a mystery-solver team-up movie, the plot is not particularly engaging. If you know your Batman and Scooby-Doo, you should have just about enough clues to figure out the culprit before the movie ends."
0," While acknowledging that some of the film's individual scenes are quite funny, the overarching story needed work."
0, ...isn't all bad - but it isn't all good either.
0," [Director] Condon paints with such broad, familiar strokes that the film feels generic; in setting out to tell everyone's story, Condon ends up telling no one's."
2," Within its modest docudrama style, Momma's Man addresses universal experience as presumptuously as does a mainstream Pop epic."
2," You didn't think it was going to be as good as the first one, did you?"
2, Inside Out is a very fun and smart movie. [full review in Spanish]
0," Nicolas Cage could possibly have had a ball with the role, but McConaughey, who says he was drawn to the character immediately, doesn't effectively communicate that love for the part."
2," With belief soundly suspended and your senses of sight and sound reeling under full frontal assault, this hybrid of action, chase movie sets the bar low - and clears it with ease."
2, ...a fascinating and tense low budget film drawn from real life inspiration.
0," Surely there are better alternatives for kids who deserve a respectful lesson in arctic wildlife. It may have its heart in the right place, but Arctic Tale doesn't have much of a brain to back it up."
2," It's a story that begins in an ancient riddle and ends, perfectly, in the rumble of an oncoming storm."
0, Some people find Derek Zoolander funny and likable and endearingly dumb. I don't. I find him grating.
2," It leaves the audience with neither a sense of uplift nor devastation, but, rather, with something more akin to intellectual appreciation."
2," It might have been nastier in the hands of a less experienced director but Genovese handles it with delicacy. They might all be liars, but who's going to throw the first stone?"
2, What makes the movie so delightful is that Wadjda isn't trying to make trouble; she's just being herself.
0," Lynskey is a luminous counterpoint to Phillips's energetic earthiness, but they can't lift a story with so much killjoy ballast."
2," What could have been a stellar ending to this trilogy, was only just a fine one. I also really wanted more of Bruce Willis. "
0," A crass, despicably sexist piece of Hollywood trash."
0," Dialogue is terse and predictable, and the sci-fi thriller portion is even less compelling than the Western saga."
0, ... Shrek the Third is an example of take-the-money-and-run blandness.
0," Never Go Back's family dynamic, borrowed from Terminator 2 - a surrogate partner and child for Cruise's protector/killer, enable the vertically challenged star to spend the running time with symbols of his sexual prowess and virility."
0," Tumbledown comes up light in the categories that matter most, miring a capable cast in a forced cable-knit folksiness familiar to anyone who has ever watched anything set in New England."
0," In fact, the real problems with Chapter 27 is it vagueness. Everyone here - Leto, Lohan, Friedlander - leaves us in the lurch, and nothing Schaefer does can save our confusion."
2, A fascinating if flawed film about a fascinating and flawed figure.
0, The fact that the story De Palma has chosen is only partially true makes his more extreme decisions feel that much more sadistic.
2, Trophy should be mandatory viewing in spite of its narrative presentation.
2," Sprawling, and hugely ambitious, and containing a glorious Wellesian Falstaff who's as majestic in folly as he is in girth."
2," Although the technical quality doesn't reach the precision of Japanese animation market, it's a completely enjoyable audiovisual piece. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Zwick, intent on correcting the perception of Jews as passive victims, lets the action set pieces overwhelm the more intimate scenes, several of which are already diminished by stilted dialogue."
0," As Cheadle drifts around a vaguely thought-through role, The Guard bets everything on Gleeson's boyish twinkle -- and tends to overestimate its own raffish charm."
0," Academically interesting, entertaining in a perverse sort of way, but in the end feels rather pointless."
2, There's plenty of chemistry among the superb veteran cast.
2, The Guest is what might happen if John Carpenter made a Halloween movie in which Michael Myers takes off his mask and turns out to be a pretty cool guy.
0," An interesting idea, but with so many cooks involved, the broth isn't quite good enough."
2," On the whole, Foxcatcher is a very intense and suspenseful film that builds to its act of madness-Miller gets more out of the previously spudlike Channing Tatum than any previous director."
2," For all the animal antics on display here, the movie also gently broaches all-too-human issues of stereotyping, prejudice and racism. This is something worthwhile to chew over, even for younger audiences."
0," There are some laughs and, at least on screen, more than a few tears. But it doesn't come together with the kind of satisfying punch a comedy should deliver."
0, Adds absolutely nothing new to the chronic mopery and unattractive self-regard that have come to characterize an increasingly tiresome genre.
0, [A] clotted and evasive movie...
2, Coco has become an endearing film for many Mexicans. [Full Review in Spanish]
2," The best thing about it is the very thing that's most potentially maddening to moviegoers. Movies and TV offer US a steady diet of reductive emotional sensationalism but this one, like its protagonist, keeps a cool head even in horrific situations."
2," It's worth seeing because the film is competently presented and the story is inherently important, but I couldn't help be disappointed that the result wasn't more fresh or visionary."
2," Gillespie's movie glides like a drunken skater, contained but changing direction with each tangent and tantrum."
2," Sausage Party is a delicious treat covered in a filthy wrapper. For some, that will be a deal breaker, but for plenty of others, it will be a selling point."
0," By the end, you'll be glad they went extinct."
0, It's everything you don't go to the movies for.
0," There's nothing worthwhile about a single moment of it, not even in a prurient, I-love-to-wallow-in-debauchery sort of way. It is simply rancid, unbathed, country-fried filth."
0," The story stagnates with the null drawing of characters, a cadence that is not ruled out but morose, and the gratuity of certain dialogues. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2, Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's period piece is a work of art. He expands his exploration on relationship dynamics to reveal a wickedly humorous newfound romance that is both suffocating and Machiavellian.
0," The only reasons to see this structurally messy, poorly directed flick are the spectacular effects, which overwhelm the plot, and the charismatic performance of soon to be Hollywood star Aussie Sam Worthington who steals every scene he is in."
0, I've never seen Kristen Bell more unlikable and Kelsey Grammer more likable ever until this movie.
0," Mann seems undecided about what he wants Enemies to accomplish, so he tries a little bit of everything."
0," Gigi is dressed to kill, but if all the French finery impresses the customers, it also smothers the story."
2," Tells a specifically Chinese story, and yet it does so in a completely universal way."
0, Man of Steel starts feeling like just another generic superhero movie - the exact opposite to the radical and unique stamp Nolan placed on the Dark Knight trilogy
0, The sex was good but the delirious lesbian mumblecore didn't leave a lasting impression.
2," There is so much attention to detail, it's genuinely just fun to look at. Very imaginative."
2, While none of it's anything particularly spectacular or memorable ... it works as needed.
2," Hayek and Lithgow are outstanding in their lead roles as spiritual opposites, though one wishes the script included more exchanges between them."
0, [VIDEO ESSAY] Indolent pacing combines with tone-deaf dialogue for a movie that is a chore to endure. 
0, The least fun of the three: overworked and uninspired.
2, Extremely original masterpiece in British cinema
2," The pugnacious John C. is gifted and knows no bounds. Walking hard, for him... effortless."
2," Saoirse Ronan plays this interior drama with intelligence and a sincerity that seems true to the film's era. In some ways she's an innocent abroad, but she's nobody's patsy. What a refreshingly authentic character to root for."
2," Karolina Gruszka is very good as Curie, conveying a mix of intelligence and romantic impulse; unfortunately no one else in the cast comes close to her level of investment."
2," An altogether astonishing film, not in the least because Winter's Bone lives up to the hype -- or so nearly that it makes no difference."
0, Scott's film can't quite decide whether it's fully behind the Almighty's righteous ire or not. 
2, More than just a not-so-instant replay...even for viewers who regularly skip the Super Bowl it will be something to cheer.
2," Screenwriter Rebecca Frayn's full feature debut is alluring, fascinating to watch and, most importantly, makes you care about Suu Kyi."
0," The cast adds little. Columbus Short, a dancer-turned-actor, can move well, but he mugs too much for the camera when he's supposed to be having fun, and barely holds the screen when he's not."
2, But the film's fascination lies less in its portraits of grievously flawed men than in its presentation of the heroine as a riddle for us to solve.
0," Can a video game turn a movie into a hit, man? Maybe. But that doesn't mean that ""Hitman"" is far removed from its video game origins."
0," If you swallow this type of thing no matter what, proceed without caution. For mildly discerning viewers 27 Dresses is like re-swallowing something you already coughed up."
2," It all escalates into an arch, knowing throwback to 80s horror-thrillers that's muddled in parts but never less than entertaining: think a trashier version of last year's Stoker."
0, Witless even by slasher-film standards.
0," It's the work of a filmmaker who is in love with cinema, but not entirely certain how to express it."
2," Palahniuk's novels are so wilfully quirky, so egocentric, so out there, that transferring them to the screen must be like using chopsticks to transport a blancmange across a room."
0," Accomplished visually and busy sonically, it nonetheless falls short with a story of rock 'n' roll demonic possession that scarcely begins to exploit the ideas embedded in its serviceable premise."
2, Awesomely dumb slapstick is for teens and adults only.
2," In the end, the film belongs to Aparicio, whose unmannered performance gives Roma an extra dimension of poetic realism."
0, ... visual patina strongly reminds one of a TV movie... [Full review in Spanish]
0," Cattet and Forzani are more interested in the imagery and textures of giallo than they are in telling a rich, comprehensible story. "
2," Mordant, melancholic but impressive debut for director Affleck."
0, Richard Matheson's disappointing adaptation of his own rather disappointing novel.
0," ""Big Hero 6"" is a mish-mash of mixed messages, from its ""compassion over violence, through violence"" finale to its clumsily appropriated Japanese stylistic flourishes."
2, An emotionally observant character study.
2," JJ Abrams has perfectly captured the spirit of the original trilogy, with great characters, terrific action set-pieces, and a surprising amount of humour."
2," There are so many subtle jokes, or little bits of insight into these fish's minds, it proves yet again that Pixar strives to make a complete experience instead of just 'some cool-looking graphics.'"
0, Spectacularly tedious.
0," Two down, presumably five to go, and already the franchise is entering dangerous territory: if you aren't one of the many who know their Harry Potter chapter and verse, prepare for a nap."
2," No one is better at this kind of performance than Nicolas Cage. He's a fearless actor. He doesn't care if you think he goes over the top. If a film calls for it, he will crawl to the top hand over hand with bleeding fingernails."
2, A spirited pulp-adventure that should make doubters take this fishy hero seriously.
2," This is the cinematic superhero showdown you've dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that's everything - and all - it wants to be."
0," There are things in San Andreas that no one would have dreamed of seeing 40 years ago, when Earthquake (with its tacky, plaster-cracking ""Sensurround"") represented the state of the art. But nothing means anything."
0, A film full of cliches and vices of American indie cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Unless you're an M Night Shyamalan fanatic aching to see the writer/director play one of the film's main characters, there's no reason to endure Lady in the Water."
0," All the smouldering gorgeousness of Rooney Mara, Theo James, Jack Reynor and Eric Bana can't dress up this mawkish slog of a movie."
2," [VIDEO] Richard Linklater's impeccable black comedy - based on the real-life exploits of Carthage, Texas mortician Bernie Tiede - is so infectiously eccentric that you don't want the movie to end. "
0," Everything is so on-the-nose that this film turns into the place where subtlety goes to die..rehashed generation-gap humor, with a shortage of jokes that actually work. "
0," Nothing gets explored at length, and some key points are glossed over altogether, namely Héctor's out-of-wedlock son and his frequent womanizing. Such factual details would demoralize Puchi. They are merely mentioned, then ignored."
2," A fun concert film too-often interrupted by unilluminating and fawning ""behind the scenes"" flattery. "
2," Amusing, melancholy, and meditative, Ghost Dog is a modern classic of the hit man genre."
0, The Water Horse features an awkward combination of real-life drama and cutesy physical humor that never blends.
0," Cowboys & Aliens is one of the silliest movies ever made, but so many otherwise serious people have attached their names to it that, as Arthur Miller wrote in Death of a Salesman, attention must be paid."
2," You need a big screen to savour these effects as well as these performances, particularly Sandler, who discovers deep pockets of vulnerability in his familiar comic rage, and the aptly-named Marvel, who is one."
2," It's like an extended version of a convention video, crafted to please the faithful and maybe haul in a few uncommiteds."
0," It offers up easy explanations of the world, Fischer, and everything else rather than go into depth on anything."
2," The film paints a disturbing and expansive portrait of the civil rights movement-from Jim Crow's ""separate but equal"" charade and demonstrations, to forced desegregation and the eventual victory of an African American in the White House."
2," ...A good seafaring yarn, not romanticized like the cartoons or summer action pictures, but simply told with honesty and verisimilitude, the way it really must have happened."
2," The grim irony at the heart of Farhadi's film is that the angst and perplexity are the fruit of a ""sacred"" republic of ideals. "
2," The maddest thing about this mad, mad movie: it has no reason to be consistent. But somehow it is."
2, Bell's revelation is that females (even high-achieving ones) are surprisingly likely to use a voice that suggests they're an ickle-wickle pushover.
0," ""The sequel to group one, only stupider"" is how one soldier describes the squad, in one of the rare self-referential jokes here that actually lands. But owning it doesn't excuse it."
2, The joyously silly and ultraviolent black comedy Kingsman: The Secret Service captures the spirit of 2960s Cold War spy movies.
2," Even better, the quirky story of a boy and his dog shows that Burton has still got plenty of wonderful weirdness to bring to the big screen."
2," Proof that Pixar still has that intangible magic, and is able to make movies for children, adults - and the adults of tomorrow."
0, Yet another depressing confirmation of the inability of filmmakers to turn decent videogames into decent films.
0, This is like fan fiction from someone who only has one genre in their Netflix queue.
0," It takes more than just the right clothes and soundtrack to imbue a flick with genuine Eighties spirit: though the leads click charmingly, this feels exactly like a Noughties teen comedy in yuppie drag."
2, Director Miranda shows real skill here.
0," Let me be blunt: In three days of thinking, I cannot remember a movie worse than Striptease."
0, A comedy in everything except actually being funny.
0, Part of its problem is infantilism.
0," The story regurgitates the usual trappings of underdog tales, milking stereotypes as well as tear ducts."
0," Instead of ending, it all just gives up with a sort of ""never mind"" ending that even Mr. Woodcock would have to call a foul on. Indeed, that is the best possible assessment of the movie as a whole."
0, Butler's character starts murdering people simply to get them out of his way so that his diabolically exact and completely preposterous plan can fully bloom.
2, A spooky ghost story that singes the nerves as much as it coddles the mind.
0," The two individually likable stars do eventually reach some level of warmth, but by that time the film is nearly over and Kate and Leopold are supposed to be madly in love with each other."
0," One of those films that commits few egregious errors, but scales few real heights. There is nothing either terribly wrong or keenly right about it. It's tidy, I suppose."
2," In an age of a rebooted ""Wonder Woman,"" Bell is the real thing, intrepid, fierce and smart."
0," Strangely self-serious, and without covering the prerequisites of top-shelf nastiness that contemporary horror requires, this giant crocodile movie turns out to be neither fish nor fowl."
2," Train to Busan is undoubtedly a remarkable thriller and a well-assembled film, regardless of whether it works for it to narrate from drama or include political subtexts. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Overall, fatally ersatz but good natured at heart."
0," An artificial, almost theatrical quality to the dialogue and staging conflicts with the material's character-driven nature."
2, Fascinating from start to finish.
0," Allen undermines these slight stories by cutting between them, even though the timelines don't match up. As Baldwin says: ""With age comes exhaustion."""
2," It's an emotional dissonance Pixar has always been supremely comfortable with, as Toy Story 3 once again proves with knowing humor, wildly imaginative visual virtuosity and bittersweet rue."
2," A worthwhile... meticulously reported film, splashed with [Morris'] own, unique style."
0," When an action movie has you dreading the action sequences, and yawning through the rest, it's pretty safe to say it's a born loser."
0, Forgettable teen comedy has lots of sex and drinking.
0, ...so many beautiful explosions here that `Stealth' might work as a fetish film for pyromaniacs.
0, It's the storytelling that keeps landing on its keister.
0," It should feel like Star Wars, yet it fails to feel like a movie at all. Conran has done his work almost too well. It's as if you're sitting in front of an outsize comic book with a speed reader as page-turner."
0," In its lesser moments, though, the film plays like a bad student revue."
2," Not only is it another stellar Cap movie, it's maybe my favorite Tony Stark movie, and it also proves how you put a million heroes in the same movie effectively."
0, This PG-23 rated film is perfectly appropriate for any 23-year-old who has served time in an adult prison.
2," Grey and grim, this really isn't kids' stuff, but the kids won't be deterred. "
2," A complex, challenging film that uses a singular tragedy to illuminate the dark implications of Israeli policy in the occupied territories, for both sides."
0, Have you ever wanted to watch General Hux at his most detached strangle the life out of realistic looking bunny while he curses him for driving him to murder?
0," Lizzie is initially shown to be a party girl...and borderline-incestuous flirt until the grisly crimes put her in the local law's crosshairs, resulting in an anticlimactic trial that even pros like Billy Campbell and Gregg Henry can't enliven."
0," Though even the most accomplished improvisers occasionally rely on shtick, Wayans simply recycles the same gags; his ""improv"" is all shtick, with little riffing and no sense of flow."
0, Van Sant's direction is as subtle as the fracking process itself.
2," Though the film predictably finishes on just one of its number, it is in the many that Lone Survivor's components best succeed."
2," Hallstrom and Beaufoy have no great pretensions. They're out to deliver a feelgood film, but it's a very classy one."
2," A brilliant formalist, Loznitsa likes to turn his camera on crowds in motion, turning each sequence into a collective indictment."
0," Travolta is trying a little too hard here, and it shows."
2, A Violent Man is a good film with a good cast and story. Fans of film noir are going to appreciate the final product.
2," Naz & Maalik unfolds with a youthful vitality, bolstered by the charm of its lead actors."
2," These stylised tableaux are populated by an ensemble of grotesques, deadpanning their way through postures of longing, melancholy and craven selfishness."
2," Try to imagine the acrid TV satire of Network, lit up by the sodium glare of an LA crime flick from the 2980s, and you're some of the way into Nightcrawler."
2, So gifted is Mamet as a writer and director that he can fascinate us even when he's pulling rabbits out of an empty hat.
0, More pageant drama than historical speculation.
0, No one is conniving or desperate enough for the movie to become a decent melodrama. And the conversations are too stale to culminate in interesting romance.
0," Until about two-thirds of the way in, Save Me plays its central hypothesis surprisingly, um, straight."
0, Eighty-nine of the longest minutes ever endured in recent cinema.
0," While everything looks splendid, the film engages less the longer it goes on. True story or no, the final act treads very familiar territory."
2, This is classic Capracorn.
0," [The Sacrament] didn't make me a believer in Ti West or the mumblegore gang, although it did make me a believer in Gene Jones."
2, A lot more perceptive and witty than most other cheerleader movies.
0," It is truly sad how the masses will seem to fall for any movie that wraps serious, probing subject matter around a conventional love story."
0, The main problem with Mute is that it doesn't use its technologically-advanced backdrop to say anything new.
0, The film errs on the side of formula even as it carries the sheen and delicacy of something handmade.
2," Like All The President's Men, it's a muckraker movie that celebrates the power of the press by actually showing journalists doing their job, pen and notebook in hand."
0, The thudding sounds you hear at New In Town are jokes landing like lead balloons and conking the life out of the actors.
0, A dumb but lively rock musical.
2, [A] sweetly daffy picture about coming of age in punk-era England.
0," Somewhere between Ready Player One and The Emoji Movie, summoning up a zero-gravity spectacle of dazzling colours and vertiginous perspectives, a featureless and inert mashup of memes, brands, avatars and jokes."
0, ...appears to have been made from the parts of other films...
2, Surprisingly sweet Allen entry brought to life by Mira Sorvino.
2," The incredible, surprising design - the vibrant colors, imaginative shapes and textures that make up the prehistoric world - is the movie's real star."
0," this is a movie that, when faced with finding a way out of its considerable contrivances, simply cheats"
0," The concept never really takes off on screen. Moreover, the only way such presumably uplifting cinema can work is if one feels in some ways for the characters and situations."
2, Confidence can make you feel good about being played for a sucker.
0," The comedy shifts focus from the character mismatch to Sandler alone, and the movie itself transforms into a typical Sandler comedy, complete with random jokes and mushy, false sentimentality."
0," Above all a meditation on loneliness, the narrative is frequently interrupted by static landscape shots accompanied by Aimie reading letters to her absent dad -- stabs at poetry that feel less poetic, and more calculated, with every recurrence."
0," ...I also question whether this will be one of those movies where, after you get the joke, the second viewing may be more pleasurable. Sadly, the first time wasn't a charm..."
2," A weirdo atmosphere of the bizarre and the impassioned, building on the tonal switcheroo of ""Red State"" to reach a new level of deranged entertainment I hope Smith is interested in perfecting."
2," This is a great deal more entertaining than it sounds, in large part because the two actors are gifted mimics -- Brydon the better one, although Coogan doesn't think so."
0," Sometimes only a fine line separates tragic sweep from a movie that never comes to life as anything other than actors dressed in costumes, straining to inhabit an alien chapter of history."
2," Thanos as an overall villain is menacing, powerful and with a purpose. He believes his mission is the right mission, no matter how heinous it may be."
0," It's slickly done, pleasantly watchable, but despite Barrymore's ever-charming earnestness, not quite a home run."
2," It's a fascinating bundle of contradictions--authentic in a million details, deeply romanticized in others. Cool, calm and collected, this is more love story than gangster picture."
0," Audrey Tautou made her name with Amelie, and 22 years on she's still pretty cute. Whether that's enough to sustain a 209-minute movie is another matter."
2, ...une balance parfaite de contemporain et de classique...
0," The makers of Hot Pursuit would love to add Reese Witherspoon and Sofía Vergara to that list of great odd couples in road movies. They won't, because the two entirely lack what those other duos had in abundance -- chemistry."
2," Tarnation may not always be pretty, but it's pure, powerful stuff."
0, Here we have a vampire movie that brings together elements from other more popular movies.
2, Bhumi Pednekar has established herself as the go-to actor to play the extraordinary ordinary woman.
2, Fascinating yet almost inevitably self-defeating.
0," Oh my, it's a bit of a mess, isn't it."
2," There may be no improvement of the human condition to be found here, but there's a pervasive solidarity - like a ratty sofa whose dilapidation is inseparable from its coziness."
2," It's a story you wouldn't believe to be true unless you see it, and after watching [Redford's] adaptation, it's easy to understand how and why Tucker was so efficacious at being successful as a career criminal."
0," Although the production values are exceptional, especially the costuming, this is about as captivating as watching paint dry."
2, A veteran documentarian's 40 years of charting the changing fortunes of Cuba and its people yields an informative and personal portrait of Castro's nation.

2," ""A kind and decent film, though it doesn't add to Robinson's legacy."""
2, A guilty pleasure...the knife's not blunt yet
2," Swashbuckling smarts and Downey, Jr. as the perfect super-sleuth."
0," Did ""Broken City"" have to be quite so dull and humorless and artificial?"
0, Nauseating claptrap that allows a war criminal to waste 203 minutes of our time and over $20 of our hard-earned money in self-justification. Errol Morris should be ashamed of himself.

0, The high winds of hamminess roar through the rafters in Corinna McFarlane's The Silent Storm.
0, Comes across like a work in progress that no sane viewer would wish any closer to completion
0," Moore and Lucas are content to serve up the same strident, careless vulgarity, mixing up a batch of this expired nog as quickly as possible before audiences have a chance to reconsider their fondness for the original film."
2," Panh ... simply lets his subjects tell the story, and the words create an unrelenting and often hard-to-take portrait of a national despair."
2, Disney should be applauded for adding more diversity to their Princess court. Those good intentions can only mask a few errors and can't bandage the clunky script.
0, An embarassment to brain-damaged boxers and their wussy sons everywhere.
2," August's journey is good for the soul, the rapturous beauty of it all so all-encompassing just thinking about it again can't help but fill me with unabashed joy."
0," So willfully, smugly eccentric that it grows tiresome rather quickly."
0, The pointless story of a pair of privileged white people enjoying a series of lavish meals and pricey hotels is cringe-worthy in its casual and tone-deaf elitism.
0," At its narrative apex, Prince veers toward expected tragedy and then unexpectedly crumbles, both stylistically and thematically."
2, Extract Distills Potent Laughs
0," With or without the Cloverfield business, 20 Cloverfield Lane isn't a bad movie, merely a predictable and largely mediocre one."
0, An overworked and overwrought movie that is more confusing than mysterious.
2," Ghost Town is funny and moves along briskly, fulfilling the two most important qualities of a romantic comedy."
2," Some of the animation is quite beautiful, although some of it seems quite crude by today's standards."
2," The central performances from newcomer Layne (what a way to start a big screen career!) and Homecoming star James are brilliant, and there's unforgettable support from veterans Regina King and Colman Domingo as Tish's parents."
0," The whole movie felt like one of those films that I had to watch in Science class, and fell asleep to."
0," The movie commits the sin of boredom, partly because Ms. Martin is exceedingly inexpressive ..."
2, Stirring yet understated.
2, Ekaj shows flashes of brilliance and wisdom. It's reminiscent of an early film by the Safdie Brothers but manages to create its own place among the subgenre.
0, Sacrifices atmosphere and character interest for the intrigues of a murder plot that simply isn't very compelling or consequential.
0," As a scary movie, Truth or Dare is about as frightening as a slip on a banana peel."
2," Nearly every minute throbs with heart-pounding suspense, from the opening scene of a prisoner slashing his wrists with a razor blade fashioned from a cigarette filter to its mournful, blood-soaked conclusion."
0, There's a reason you've probably never heard of it.
0," It doesn't work, but Le has some decent ideas on the perversion on technology and the hellscape of Mexico, making the endeavor more of a near-miss than a wipeout."
0," While the film is sporadically funny, it was done much better on the small screen, decades ago."
0," One screenplay riff, on the taking of good advice, is piquantly memorable, but Saulnier's clever methods are insubstantial and the movie's stakes, though mortal, seem slight."
2, This homespun documentary offers an insightful look into one of the earliest eruptions of local acrimony over the issue of illegal immigration.
2, This mighty reboot steered by Blumhouse Productions captures everything that made the original great while adding multiple winning contemporary layers.
0," The plot device of young men who refuse to mature has never felt more exhausted, maybe because these actors or ones who look like them have already done this shtick in other movies."
2," It's relentless, often exhausting and frequently hilarious."
2," While the underlying formula is as evident as the prominent Northern British accents, familiarity also heightens Trespass Against Us - as do slivers of humour."
0," A blockbuster phenomenon that wouldn't exist without the efforts of other films, and somehow smugly pats itself on the back for it."
2," There is no series of images that is not a delight, nor an action sequence that does not flow smoothly. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," In their best moments, Hark's action movies have a what-did-I-just-see giddiness, as if their choreography were springing straight from a cartoon id."
2," This is a dark and shivery story about motherhood, a common subject for horror movies, but one that's rarely treated with such intelligence or seriousness of intent."
0, So turgid and enervated that it's more likely to generate snores than shudders.
2," There's a folksy majesty to Wonderful Town, born of its leisurely pace, pastoral views of idyllic scenery and a storytelling drive set only slightly faster than slow motion. It recalls a lot of rustic, independent English-language films of the '90s"
0," Silent Hill has plenty of bad acting, bad dialogue and a confusing plot -- all of which become exponentially more painful when the movie goes on forever."
0, See it if you dare.
0, The naïveté of the main character feels far less credible.
2, Even basketball-phobes will enjoy it.
2," [Damon] has lost none of his battered gravity, and director Paul Greengrass keeps the action racing forward in a splinteringly rough documentary style."
0," For all its fleeting touches of color, Firewall's main players are stranded in template land."
0," [It's] a blood-soaked, macabre and initially fascinating film. One where style made sure substance never got the invite to attend, then takes over the whole mad -- and maddeningly slow -- shebang."
2," Lavish and lengthy, it has the spectacle and spirit of a Saturday matinee movie but not its fleetness or fun."
2," Lynn Shelton's breakthrough bromance comedy is funny, sharp and true -- with no preachy sexual politics."
0," Been there, done that, got a Mandy Moore tee shirt"
0, Why on earth anyone would want to waste a summer matinee afternoon with Hancock when they could get wasted with Shakes the Clown in the DVD privacy of their own lair?
0," It's just dull from beginning to end. And that's a surprise; ""dull"" isn't a term I'd usually use to describe Redford's work."
2," This scary feature breathed new life into the horror genre, launching a length film franchise and introducing to audiences a major actress, Sigourney Weaver, in a tough role typically allotted to men."
2, A ballsy debut by [writer-director-star] Avedisian and one that's not to be missed.
0," None of it makes a ripple of sense, even when blown up to IMAX 3D size."
0, Kind of like when Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor tried to recapture the magic of SILVER STREAK and came out with ANOTHER YOU. THE INTERNSHIP is that kind of a failure. Avoid at all costs!
0," By their nature, pests are meant to get under your skin and this one certainly does."
0," Sen-Gupta's talent as an art director (which is how he began his film career) is not in doubt, but his grasp of narrative is flimsy."
2, Is there an American actor of more meaningful solitude than Sam Elliott?
0, This exercise in Eighties computer-game nostalgia is strangely misconceived.
0," A jumble of predictable but also incoherent plot turns, dreadful dialogue, and unfortunate visual choices."
2, A film that's as difficult as it is brilliant.
2," The performances are solid, with a special nod to the droll buffoonery of Zach Gilifianakis, whose character is out of it even when he is sober and alert."
2," In the midst of an ongoing debate, Concussion takes a side, but it's not bullheaded, nor is it fearful. Like the best films of its genre, it knows veracity is the best defense."
2," A pleasingly discursive road movie for our geosocial age, writer-director Jérôme Reybaud's debut narrative feature navigates la France profonde with the help of Grindr."
2, Manages to entertain even as it's floating into the ether.
2, One of the most gut-wrenching portraits of family dysfunction ever to hit a movie screen.
0," Diesel and Walker can play their roles in their sleep, and the lack of expression on the former's face suggests he might be ..."
0," Orion serves up another long-on-the-shelf turkey with this gimmicky, poorly conceived comedy."
0, I initially rated it 8/20 because it is extremely well produced and acted. But then I fact-checked it...Parker inserts too many things that are simply not true and omits the fact that he massacred innocent women and children.
2," Amy will do two things. Firstly, it will make you feel worse that such an incredible talent, with unparalleled soul could not get it together. Secondly, with the toxicity of her environment it's a miracle that she lived as long as she did. "
2, Psychologically and emotionally draining when it counts.
0," A piecemeal attempt at putting a bow on Michael Jackson's overblown and bankrupt career, this clinical behind-the-scenes collage of the rehearsal process for MJ's doomed London performance schedule is more propaganda than documentary."
2, A mesmerizing documentary that will enlighten and captivate audiences of all ages
0," While younger viewers may be moderately amused, this will not go down in the annals of great cartoons."
2," These Marvel sagas are insurmountably better than the relentlessly po-faced, self-important, chaotic and cruel DC movies."
0, What Just Happened spends so much time on the inside of the moviemaking industry that it fails to consider one person outside who might find its story interesting.
2, A powerful piece of work that might make a difference if enough people see it.
2, The latest adaptation of 'The Grinch' delivers a satisfying and enjoyable product that pushes Illumination Animation on the artistic front.
2, Gugu Mbatha-Raw holds the screen with her impassioned portrayal.
2, The sweet pain it affords arises not from watching other people flail at life; it comes from recognizing their struggles as our own.
2, More intelligence and less fighting could have made this a better film.
2, Terrific performances and unfailing visual polish ensure that it's never a dull watch...
2," Innocence is full of charm and strangeness -- and a sense that childhood is a place of incredible terrors and fleeting joys, of rapt innocence and fatal experience."
2," There's no denying the film has a tendency to trip over its own ungainly strides, but it has enough firepower to entertain action fans -- as long as they don't look too closely."
0," Apparently designed as a Michael Bayhem gateway drug to hook the few kids considered too young for 'Transformers' movies, this grim and charmless update is about the last thing the culture needs: The 'Dark Knight' of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies."
2," Robbie dives into the role like she's fearlessly attempting a triple axel. It's a rangy role that could have fallen into parody, but Robbie seems to hold a genuine affinity for Harding. This movie would not be what it is without that."
0," Everything is black and white here, a tremendous disservice considering the complexity of the issue."
0," Despite its title, ""The Women"" is not an update of George Cukor's diva smackdown of the same name."
0, The only advantage these not-too-bright kids have is that the zombies spend a lot of time posing and growling...
2," ...what makes this ""chuckles n' chemo"" film so watchable is that it is, at its core, a fish out of water tale."
0," had the potential to be smarter, boundary-pushing science fiction along the lines of District 9, but with its underdone characterization and critical failures of imagination, it barely manages to meet the low standards of Cloverfield."
2, ...has a Hitchcockian sense of suspense to it
0, Presumably there's some kind of story going on here but director Michael Bay doesn't seem all that interested in it so why should you be? But more often things just happen because EXPLOSIONS! 
0," It just falls flat, flat, flat."
2," A playwright and an actress living together should complement each other, and these two women have remarkable chemistry throughout; in a movie with empathy for individuals who choose theater as a profession regardless of limited job openings. "
2," This is the Wolverine story fans have wanted to see on screen all along, and the filmmakers are to be commended for taking the character to this difficult but necessary place."
2," Into Darkness is an enjoyably solid effort, but it suffers from a lack of the innovation and inspiration of its predecessor (or indeed of Abrams's best work on TV)."
2, Magical and utterly mesmerising.
0, Pales beside the original.
2," Guerrero's attitude toward the teenagers - understanding and affectionate, without being cloying - is what holds your interest."
2, More of a Valentine to the original than a recycled cash-grab.
0," If you can claw your way through some ugly material and shoddy direction, there are some good messages here that can be warmly received."
2," The film's emotional center is... a moment of such intense, painful calm and seriousness that it seems like an age since the film was entertaining us with pistol play."
2," This is the best documentary of the year so far. This is Michael Moore at his one-sided, bombastic, pot-stirring best."
0," If you want to feel good about a war with no end, this one's for you."
0," An extremely broad Nordic noir parody, or at the very least a join-the-dots handbook for the genre impaired: Scandinavian Crime Drama for Dummies."
2, It's a wistful charmer.
0," The premise is out of '70s porn, and so is the overbroad satire and almost total lack of conviction."
0, Every scene between Bullock and Reynolds only suggests how fine they might be in good circumstances.
2," Mad Max: Fury Road delivers. There's no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen, Max roars back with a vengeance."
2, Kubo and the Two Strings is a magical motion picture in every sense of the word.
2," A maddening film more to be admired than enjoyed as it wrestles with questions of faith, compassion, and the prison of dogma. "
2," ""The Brothers Bloom"" operates on a much larger scale, a globe-hopping, visually dazzling caper comedy, but at heart it's just as in love with language and storytelling as ""Brick"" was."
0, I never thought I'd find myself waxing nostalgic for the charms of 'Scary Movie 2.'
2," Gangster Squad is a stylish, tension-filled watch but, for all its brutal violence and determined men, it lacks the depth of character to make it truly memorable."
2," Tsotsi presents a world of terrible beauty, where humanity struggles to breathe despite all attempts to snuff it out."
2," Beautifully shot, touchingly performed and delivered with a thrillingly atmospheric sense of place, Heartstone lets us meditate on these themes during that long last summer..."
0, Hot Tub Time Machine 2 commits the two biggest sins of the dudebro comedy genre legitimized by the success of The Hangover series. The first is that this sequel exists at all. 
2," A serious and meditative film about loss, mourning, and the changes that come with them. "
0, It is terrible. It is fabulously entertaining.
2," Bridesmaids is a hoot, but it's also ridiculously overlong and surprisingly unadventurous, almost afraid to pursue its most compelling qualities. "

2," If Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth was a warning, The 22th Hour is the red alert."
0, Slightly more interesting of this week's mediocre old folks movies.
0, ... good-looking but not quite memorable ...
2, A wonderfully absurd film. McDonagh is never stuck for a brilliant kiss-off line. I doubt he'll ever be stuck for an audience either.
0, This is a movie with the courage to examine the pressing issue of whether hot blond Aussie starlets are sleeping with government agents -- whom they meet in fender benders -- to get green cards.
2, One of the films of the year. Unmissable.
2, The story of the polyamorous trio who created D.C.'s iconic Amazonian hero doesn't skimp on the kinky sex - or the sense of female empowerment. You'll never look at Wonder Woman in the same way again. 
2," A gripping murder mystery about the fated coupling of a pair of calculating romantics too smart for their own good, and the limits of the American justice system."
0, A fascinating mess.
2, An engaging comedy-drama about adolescent outsiders who dabble in fan-fiction while inventing themselves.
0, Totally fumbles the fanboy excitement it generated when Willis's David Dunn turned and looked at the camera at the end of Split.
0," I suspect that von Trier, like many of his European counterparts, views American sexual mores as fairly puritanical. And yet there's something awfully retrograde about a film which offers us a nymphomaniac only to have a man defend her."
2," ""You're Next"" draws on the home invasion/haunted house scenario, but outclasses [other films] with its wit, irony, and technically proficient terror."
2, ... a big effects-driven film delivered on a shoestring.
2," As far as detached setups go, this is a movie that effectively rouses our suspicions into something of dogged interest."
2," Its brightness, cleanness, tightness, and wit all go in to making it feel as fresh and alive as any other piece of animation from its generation."
0, This stupid movie is Grade-A suckiness!
0," This follow-up to the 2009 original is even more terminally dumb and dopey, with co-writer, co-producer and star Kevin James hamming it up horribly."
0," The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom, but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing."
0," I know Julia Roberts, and you, Patrick Dempsey, are no Julia Roberts"
2," Hákonarson's film evolves into something increasingly compassionate, with matters culminating on a sincere, surprisingly moving note, that's both tender and tragic."
2," By-the-numbers kid's movie elements prevent Epic from completely living up to its name; nonetheless, it's still a solid film for the whole family."
0," For a movie with considerable talents involved, ""Beautiful Boy"" lacks the dramatic sparks needed to get us invested in its story."
2," Central Intelligence is a glaringly flawed affair, but the clichés and lazy set-ups are, to a certain degree, endured thanks to the irresistibly compelling onscreen chemistry of the two leads."
0, Ironically it's Branagh's relentless and painfully obvious attempts to keep the action visually 'interesting' that makes the proceedings come off even more stagy.
2," a giddy, grin-producing guilty pleasure"
0, I fail to grasp the point of making this movie.
0, Sputters to an end without building to any sort of satisfying conclusion.
2," Professor Marston and the Wonder Women is a powerful, unique drama."
0," I'm not cynical about hope, just the way that romantic comedies exploit it, without necessarily delivering. When in Rome does that to a large degree, even basing its conceit on a wishing well, the ultimate exploitation of hope."
2," It's not ""On Golden Pond"" by any stretch, but it is nice to have Fonda back in the fractious family way."
0," When you come down to it, its hoary insights -- like 'men are slobs' and 'women can never decide what to wear on a date' -- have been the stuff of sitcoms since the seven words you couldn't say on television were taboo in movies as well."
0," Writer-director James DeMonaco's main tactic, when not coming up with dialogue like ""Run. Fast,"" is simply to have bad guys blown away by good guys who keep sneaking up behind them."
0," As bastardizations of beloved children's books go, this one isn't terrible-certainly not as offensive as The Cat in the Hat, for instance-but it has the potential to be a genuinely good movie and blows it. That's a real shame. In a total..."
0, becomes bogged down and eventually engulfed by its bewildering lack of rationality
0," The movie is a near-relentless intellectual muddle, throwing out signifiers and metaphors lazily and to no particular effect."
2," Much like one of Elizabeth's classes, there are no lessons to be learned, but this mischievous, borderline amoral little number passes the time in a surprisingly amusing fashion."
2, Technically impeccable. [Full Review in Spanish]
0, A film with some decent talent but few laughs.
2," A madcap fable as purposeful as it is unpredictable, that bears no whiff of a committee, for (mostly) better or (occasionally) worse."
2," ...there's enough good here to make the less-good aspects forgivable: you root for Evan and Zoe to be a couple who last, and outlast."
2," A trippy, nonstop action fest, with the feel of a really good episode of Heroes."
2," ... a smart and sharply realized vision of a not-too-distant, not-too-dystopian future [that] doesn't get too fussy with the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics."
2," Although the parents perhaps will fall asleep with its kindergarten humor, full of hugs and colorful cupcakes, the youngest will truly enjoy this film. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Aronofsky's long-time-coming version of spiritual wonder is finally more mind-numbing than soul-stirring.
2," ""Snowden"" is a film that should frighten us, but instead it seems to garner shrugs of ""yeah man, it sucks."""
2, Clint Eastwood has infused the picture with a typically deliberate and methodical feel that certainly complements Brian Helgeland's somewhat drawn-out screenplay...
0," Lazy, stupid, recycled, immature, predictable, unfunny ... a pathetic attempt by a dead franchise to scrape the bottom of an already filthy barrel and squeeze a few more dollars from audience members seeking clichéd nostalgia. "
2, The level on which it works is primal-and frighteningly effective.
0," Red Riding Hood is a fantasy fairy tale with a twist of Twilight, but it doesn't quite come together, despite some striking images and a strong performance from Seyfried."
0, A study of just how to screw up what ought to be an awesome movie.
2," It's not [the Dardennes'] finest work (which would be 2999's shattering drama Rosetta), but is still a worthy addition to an impressive resume."
2, It's clear immediately that Curse of Chucky marks an effort to return to the more-horrific-than-comedic atmosphere of the series' first installment...
2," Fantastic pacing, an excellent performance by Gyllenhaal and smart storytelling make this a wonderful film."
2, Stylistically The Unknown Girl follows the Dardennean style manual... [Full review in Spanish]
0," It labors under the delusion that it's this year's revelatory, eye-opening Maria Full Of Grace, when it's little more than a B-movie with an overwrought conscience."
2, There's nothing in the film that we haven't seen countless times before. But it's a pleasure to see the familiar genre handled so expertly.
2," Jacob's Ladder only belongs to the horror genre insofar as it understands these conventions well enough to simultaneously borrow from and transcend them. In the process, it becomes something else altogether. "
0," Your typical sports drama, with an extra dose of inspirational sap. Plus a lot of ripped, hairless ephebe flesh. Victor Salva strikes again!"
2," If you love Family Guy and worship at the alter of McFarlane you will absolutely adore Ted. It's ridiculous, inappropriate, hilarious, nostalgic, geek heroin. "
0," Mangold never makes his dusty landscape an omnipresent force, but his direction is crisp and the script's good additions more or less counterbalance the awful."
2, A film full of suspense with an absorbing narration and that goes far in its macabre fantasy of corpses. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Kong: Skull Island is a perfectly acceptable monster mash. Kong looks great, the action is thunderous, and any film that features John C. Reilly using a samurai sword to battle giant monsters is definitely worth seeing."
0, A talented ensemble cast is wasted in this nauseatingly manipulative and sentimental bit of holiday swill that hasn't a single saving grace.
2," The film is never less than fascinating, but it appears to be so intensely personal as to be all but indecipherable to viewers not personally acquainted with the filmmaker, or at least in possession of the press kit."
0," The result is a film that is seen with some pleasure, although it is more for the charm of its protagonists than for its ability to take advantage of what it is telling us. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," I felt bad for the cameramen, editors and assistant directors who now must list this vile film on their resumes."
0," There are sparks of Shane Black's humor and style lining up with the brutality and bite of the 2987 original, but they are few and far between because the end product feels misguided, and like it's been sliced and diced to the point of semi-incoherence."
2," Lady Bird is, instead, episodic and rambling, a ruminative look back at a crucial, defining period in its creator's life."
0," Despite moments of mounting suspense, the film suffers from stilted unevenness."
2," The mood [White] creates, the subject matter he tackles, shows a rainbow coalition of dysfunction. And that makes Year of the Dog good, if strangely uncomfortable, viewing."
2," This is a high-proof product, and some of its performances are intoxicating. But the plotting is also rougher than a jar of sourmash."
0, Apocalypse new? No such luck: more like apocalypse same ol'.
2," AM's fans should get a lot out of the doc, but casual music-lovers may wish Kerslake would just get back to the party."
0," If all you need is the most surface of surface, you might like Daredevil. If you choose to think about it for a second, you can't."
0, Kong: Skull Island is an overblown monster movie that constitutes just shy of two hours of meaningless spectacle.
0," As is usually the case, the seething bad guys make for far more ""interesting"" onscreen characters than the heroes. "
2," Johannes Krisch fully embodies Unterweger's swagger, charm, and self-belief, and-the other side of the coin-his intensity, anger, and self-doubt. It's a knockout performance in a crisp, compelling film."
2, At last: they're upgraded to the starring roles they deserved all along.
2," No matter how much you know about The Doors, it's always a trip to see and to hear them, and this documentary has all the music, concert footage and shots of band camaraderie to warm a rock fan's heart."
0," A cleverly disguised expose on the challenges of parenthood, with riffs on abortion and the Electra complex thrown in for good measure, Splice is inventive enough that it's a real shame when it falls apart heading into the home stretch."
0," Disney never showed, say, Goofy actually defecating on camera, but 'Open Season' does just that with Eliott. And an entire scene is built around Boog's having a b.m."
2," A deeply human drama, which celebrates the power of activism to awaken an indifferent world."
2, What begins as yet another school-set thriller gradually evolves into something more psychologically layered.
2, The strength of this third manifestation of The Hunger Games is in the cast and in the screenplay.
0," If there are a few nuggets of wit and wisdom buried under the film's disease-of-the-week surface, Rubin doesn't find them. "
2," Even if things become muddled in the third act, the film rewards viewer patience with a thoughtful examination of guilt and social responsibility."
0," Ms. Richardson comforts and coaxes and exasperatedly, bitingly demeans, but she and Mr. Sparks play past each other instead of engaging."
2," Watch the film for the truly inspirational story, which can be said to be one of the biggest comebacks in Indian sports history."
2, Despite its flaws Watchmen is a stunning film that contains far more substance and intrigue than most comic book screen adaptations. 
0," Excruciating...They gave the ""Alien"" franchise to this guy?"
2," The humor in ""Baby Boom"" is sharp without being heartless."
0," never as clever as it thinks it is, as frightening as it hopes to be, or as thrilling as it planned on"
0," This is the kind of movie they make you watch in grade school. It's meant to be good for you, and the entry-level script has every cliché in the playbook."
0," I could not get past the pathology lurking just below the skin of this story -- its false morality, its prurient absorption in sexual violence, its sadistic glee over the hero's degradation."
2," Untold? Hardly. Yet as Skyfall appetisers go, this thorough survey of how Ian Fleming, Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman created a phenomenon could barely be bettered."
2," Ferrara sinks his teeth into a moral fable that equates bloodlust with amorality and postulates that there may, even now, be salvation for the sinner."
0," There are no sustained characters of any kind, despite some capable acting talent. There is no believable relationship between the characters. There is no attempt to develop any of the political issues the film touches upon."
0, Nolan's Vision Exceeds his Grasp.
0," Light, predictable comedy."
2," The film is atmospheric, the story is hard to follow, and scenes proceed slowly punctuated with sparse dialog"
2," Darko Stante's film takes the narrative you'd expect from a story of a man coming out in this environment and flips it on its head, creating something more unexpected, more confrontational, and altogether more exceptional."
2," [A] well paced, entertaining and thought-provoking piece of science fiction cinema, a truly superb, yet disregarded gem of that particular genre."
0, Code Name: The Cleaner is one of the year's big stinkers.
2, It's the background of the Troubles that gives this rousing biopic its edge.
0, A fascinating life is reduced to a series of skittishly edited and visually stylised vignettes that do scant justice to Marie Curie's scientific achievements and Karolina Gruszka's laudably intense performance.
2, The result is a graceful sketch pad of a movie about how the strenuousness of creating art can sometimes yield riches that look light as a feather.
2," Widows is a dark, gripping drama about women who were abused by the men in their lives and then left to fend for themselves"
2," There are some elements of The Bourne Legacy that feel a bit too much like the less-accomplished sibling of a successful older brother but not enough to offset what truly does work about this smart, engaging thriller. "
2," Through the casual pacing of the script and Harris Savides' gloriously brumous cinematography, Greenberg becomes more about other people's interpretations of Roger than the man himself."
2, This slight but enormously likable picture seems destined to be an awards magnet: A holiday release with enough formal sophistication to appeal to cinephiles and enough old-fashioned showbiz bravado to win over a general audience.
0," It's all acceptably diverting, not actively unpleasant like the 2002 sequel. There are no grand twists or revelations comparable to the truth about the ""galaxy"" in the original."
0," As I now massage my traumatised temples, I thank Devgn for appearing on the poster, and make note to heed his statutory honesty in the future. "
2," The scenes are so beautifully done that Hitchcock might have admired them, or at least their technical facility."
2," It's a fine introduction, if a bit slight for fans craving new insights."
0, Singh's main fault is identical to the wicked queen's: he can't see the point of anything beyond prettification.
0," Someday, when Mirren receives a lifetime achievement award, there will be a montage of her performances in great films. Winchester will not be a part of that montage."
2," ...has an observant, inspired, interesting and courageous approach that makes a strong lasting impression."
2," Eisenberg is superb, playing not the real Mark Zuckerberg but the character created by Sorkin, hyper-alert and obtuse, his voice both taut and tremulous. "
0," Goes from harmlessly bad to a full embrace of the very aggro-bully mindset some have currently confused for a mandate. It's the cinematic equal to a certain someone's awkward, yanking handshake. Plant your feet firmly against it. Don't get pulled in."
2, The film works really well. It maintains the spirit of the original whilst being different enough from it -- not that anyone in the target audience would care -- it's funny and jogs along nicely.
2," Nolan delivers a psychological thriller that is taut with suspense and visually stunning, even if it doesn't exactly break new ground."
2," Kelly Fremon Craig [has created] what is a true gem of a movie that has the hallmarks of a bonafide cult classic, which proves that she's truly a talent to watch out for."
2," ...at least deserves to be mentioned in the same paragraph as the original, if not the same breath."
0," Despite the best efforts of its talented cast, this joins Terminator Genisys as this summer's big disappointments. Far from fantastic."
2," Every decade has its cult teen movie. Thirty-two years ago, it was Sixteen Candles. For the '90s, it was Clueless. The early aughts had Mean Girls. Now we have The Edge of Seventeen."
0," ...an admixture that doesn't quite come together, as what might have been a romantic comedy about second chances-with kids-fights for screen time with more typical Adam Sandler fare."
2," The Albanian tradition of blood feuds partly inspired Mr. Marston to make this story, yet what gives it shape are the more familiar conventions of the classic art film, including narrative ambiguity, ellipses and silence."
2," The movie, like the novel, plays with the limits between reality and imagination, masterfully crafted by Mike Flanagan with his direction and edition. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, This flick's lazy attempts at humor -- especially making Bob Newhart say 'fo shizzle my nizzle' -- fall way short of the original.
0," Even though the story is well written and the characters are enduring, the movie becomes really predictable. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Olsen and Paulson explore their tender ambivalence, depicting the alienation and bonding of sibling experience with an insight and intimacy not often seen on the screen."
2," The Bad News Bears is at its best when, like all good major league pitchers, it isn't afraid to get a little mean."
2," Deals dramatically and memorably with the vagaries of the law, and with the wars between justice and injustice, between vengeance and mercy, between truth and prejudice."
2, A combative film. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Unlike Daniel Myrick's 'Kids,' this one treats the rebellious teen sympathetically and credibly."
2," It pulls off what has hitherto seemed an impossible feat: staying true to the spirit of the video game on which it was based, and simultaneously, breathing new life into the concept."
2," A nicely inspirational, romantic hagiography and an unmistakable call to political engagement."
2," Hard not to like, but difficult to love."
0," It is cinematic Ambien, the kind of limp affair that mistakes overheated dialogue for character or action."
0," An anticlimactic, idiotic leap into low-end Shyamalan-ian insanity with a touch of moderate fundamentalism. Nicolas Cage's performance is deserving of another YouTube ode to awfulness, and only disaster scenes elevate it above straight-to-DVD status."
0," After a good start, the second half tries to make a strong case for the film's agenda - but what it really needs is a strong character."
2, The most shocking aspect of Berg's documentary is what it presents as the abusers' utter lack of accountability.
0," For all its qualities, Under the Skin ultimately frustrates. "
0, A movie that doesn't go for the spectacular but slowly and surely a dullness pervades.
2, Pirates of the Caribbean blends its 28th-century look with impressive 22st-century visual effects.
2," ...a delicious, meaty dish"
0," Like a bad high school memory, no one wants You Again coming back to haunt them in the future."
0, The film is entertaining but not revelatory enough. There's little doubt an even more horrifying story lies beneath.
0," The only time the movie comes to life (so to speak) is during its climax, when Victor succeeds in bringing his creation to life and must deal with the subsequent rampage... After slogging through 200 minutes of tedium to get there, it's hard to care."
2, ... acknowledges its subject's talent while keeping the material honest rather than hagiographic.
2," Reynolds does a tremendous job of presenting a hardened, cocky L.A. demeanor and allowing cracks of old despair and self-doubt to chip cracks in the façade."
2, this is the kind of film that you should go into cold and let the beautiful and touching story unfold afresh.
2, Warrior sets its sights on something much deeper than fighting.
2, Introduces Grace writer/director Paul Solet as a new master of horror.
0, Never has a title been more horribly at odds with the way you're actually going to feel while watching the movie.
0," has energy and vigor to spare, but it still feels too off-the-shelf--prepackaged action and all-too-familiar riffs on the ugliness of behind-the-scenes international conflict"
2," Although played strictly for laughs, this entertaining comedy also boasts plenty of action, thrills and suspense. "
0," The result, despite Hugh Jackman's game, if overly earnest, performance, is simultaneously overstuffed and undernourished and just plain sloppy."
0, Remember how bad you thought the original movie was going to be? That.
2," Plenty to admire, amuse, contemplate and provoke."
0, This sci-fi/martial arts hybrid has the stale aura of a product assembled out of bits of other action movies.
2," Beneath its carefully crafted scares, this is a very artful movie about movies, a story about stories, and a tale of a tale-with a trademark, last-minute Shyamalan twist."
0," Gunn cherry picks from the boldest in battle royal cinema, but doesn't sharpen the effort into a fine point, content to manufacture a massacre, but wary of assigning any deeper meaning to it. "
0, A 3D film aimed mostly at children.
0, Both films are flawed and unfocused. Both have thin plots that must rely on even thinner back-stories to flesh out a feature length film.
0," Maybe there are a couple of scenes that catch our attention, but in general what we want is that everything explode and end quickly. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Can you understand the words that are comin' outta my mouth? This is racist, bullying garbage."
0," An enjoyable romantic comedy, and not much more"
2," The final product is a lo-fi, handheld hellraiser with a varying success rate but with more ballsy gusto than most mainstream horrors."
2, A satisfactory mystery thriller.
0, In Secret probes these troubled minds from an arm's-length remove.
2," Naivete, calculation and all, it looks like it would've been a helluva show, complete with eco-consciousness-raising, an onstage bulldozer and 3-D Thriller footage, newly created to dazzle audiences left high and dry by fate and Jackson's demise."
0," Depp and Smith want to put their kids in a big, expensive home movie? Fine. Do it. But show it at home."
0, It's all merely unbelievable.
0," Despite its original concept, the movie loses much of its socially satiric edge once Fraser emerges from his underground bunker and starts wooing Silverstone."
2," This is, above all, a celebration and as such is entertaining, informative and good fun."
2, It is through Idris Elba's finely etched performance that the real thesis of the film comes to the fore: it is Nelson Mandela's universally relatable core humanity that defines his heroism.
0," Lame, limp, unappealing, incompetent, clueless -- these are the kindest words I can come up with to describe this film."
2, A phantasmagorical tale
2," Anastasia is a mixed bag, but viewers ought to hope it succeeds: Disney could use the competition."
0," This Superfly is hot to look at, but it's also kind of boring, mucking up what promises to be both a tighter and a more intricate narrative."
2, Takes the risk of losing its audience by interweaving four different storylines.
0," With the overlong, limp and lazy ""Spy,"" Feig has lost his mojo."
0," While Legally Blonde 2 is bearable in a way that busier and more ambitious unfunny recent comedies like Hollywood Homicide and Alex and Emma are not, it has almost none of the ditsy charm of the original."
0," [An] astronomically silly script, which one can even imagine Luc Besson turning down as ludicrous...It's so bad, it's 'Criminal.'"
0," As is the case of any virtual carbon copy, this version isn't quite as sharp."
0, Turturro's attempt at an old school Woody Allen comedy -- mostly without the laughs. 
0," With Welcome to Marwen, director Robert Zemeckis, as he has so often in this stage of career, focuses more on the visuals of a story instead of the why of it."
2," After the monotonous guide through history that was In Search of Mozart, Phil Grabsky's follow-up plays like a much-needed shot of adrenaline to the brain."
2," A Man Called Ove is a touching portrait of a grumpy, widowed 59-year-old Swede with a heart of gold underneath his curt bad manners and frightful temper. We've been here before but it's a good spin on the theme."
0, ... unfortunately ends up being unmemorable. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Fierce People is no ordinary dud. This seedy soap opera is the most outlandish, campy romp through the mud since Showgirls."
0," By the end, I finally cared about Henry and Clare. But I wish the filmmakers had pulled me in about an hour and a half sooner."
2," Elle Fanning is downright stunning here, delivering a mature and nuanced performance as disturbing as it is thrilling."
0," Moonwalkers takes [a] weird, clumsy turn."
2, It's an arresting blend of artistic and blockbuster sensibilities that will stand the test of time right beside its trailblazing predecessor
2, Tragically timely in the light of the current situation in Afghanistan.
2, Arteta mines a lot of subtle laughs out of [Beverly and Buck's] unlikely pairing.
2," [The movie] tries to get under his... skin but that's not easy, as the toll of being the first at everything in his field-a gay black man with a Continental education-seems to weigh heavily on him as he pushes 70."
2," The final episode of George Lucas' cinematic epic Star Wars ends the six-movie series on such a high note that one feels like yelling out, 'Rewind!'"
0, Another generic action film that doesn't add anything to the genre. [Full review in Spanish]
0, Sparkle never really gets big. It pretends to.
0," If you don't buy into the idea that Usher is the foxiest brother ever to set foot on the screen, you are probably not the target audience for 'Mix,' since it has little else to offer except sizable servings of beefcake."
2," Cinematographer Anne Misawa shoots from a low angle the wonderful, subtly expressive faces of the siblings, the older melancholic, the younger endearingly clownish."
0," Cue ultraviolence, gang stereotypes, and a bucketload of plots that never really go anywhere... MFKZ is about as subtle as a house brick."
2, Anyone who doesn't believe that Clint Eastwood is one of the best film-makers in America ought to see Million Dollar Baby.
0," Bland music, marquee-friendly casting and crassly contemporary dialogue give this film the mechanical feel of a marketing exercise, not a movie."
2, Moves so fast you don't have time to think
2, Anyone inclined to argue with the logic of the story -- and there's certainly much to argue about -- is advised to just sit back and watch how Farrell's Stu unravels before our eyes.
2, The massive panoramas of wild Australia suddenly make Luhrmanns wild flourishes look puny.
0, [A] general muddle.
0, As erratic and underwhelming as its predecessor...
2, All hail Tom Hardy. No more men in masks flying around in a motorized suit. And Hardy's Taboo is set for another season.
2," While this low-key heart-squeezer isn't quite in the same league as the hauntingly beguiling Your Name, it is hard to resist its daydreamy, will-they-or-won't-they? vibe for long."
2," Despite at times feeling like a megamix of Kiraostami's greatest hits, 3 Faces manages to be much more than a product of its ingredients."
0," Pride wades into the shallows when it ought to be diving into the deep end. In waters this familiar, everyone knows how to swim."
2, It captures the strength of Fred Rogers's convictions even as his gentleness and sincerity fell further out of favor.
0," Once the plane touches land, things go downhill. The movie devolves into a by-the-book action flick."
0," Invictus is stately, handsomely mounted, attentive to detail right down to the Marmite adorning the team's breakfast buffet, and relentlessly conventional."
2," An interesting, but slow, look at the life of the legendary Chanel before she became famous."
2," The movie teems with the excitement of unwrapping a present, even as it deals more seriously with the intractability of blood ties."
2," Catherine Corsini depicts feminists in lighthearted ways, at once humorously caricatured and sensitively human. "
2," Despite its occasionally unfinished feel, Hoodwinked will probably keep everyone (adults and kids) entertained for its very brief running time."
0," Some of the talent - like The Hangover's Ed Helms - manage to escape with their dignity, just about intact, but the film's attempts to justify its adult rating become increasingly desperate."
0," The whole ethos portrayed in this film seems to be of a tightly knit group, referencing and re-referencing each other ad infinitum. "
2, What seems to be another wishy-washy teen movie is actually a surprising little number that grabs the attention at the least expected moments.
0," To a batter, a great curveball is so obvious and so frustrating at the same time. Robert Lorenz's Trouble with the Curve is much the same."
0," This version of events tends to over-explain the inspiration behind the story, undermining the genius of Dickens as an author."
2," A less violent, less successful movie that would have balanced the first film's kinetic energy had it been shown as Tarantino originally intended: as an uninterrupted whole."
0," Its murky storyline, phalanx of hard-to-distinguish characters, and glacial pace leaves the impression that both Haneke and the Academy can do better."
2, This isn't just a documentary -- this is history.
0," An awkward, painful mash-up of horror and comedy that induces all the wrong kind of squirms, Nekrotronic feels like a Z-grade SyFy Channel movie that escaped its basic-cable confines."
2," On one side is Mr. Redmayne's remarkable presence. On the other is Ms. Jones, whose lovely freshness and calm intelligence complement everything her co-star does."
0," Seyfried does her best to animate the limited content and lines, but the there's a male frame around the action that suffocates the denouement and handily obliterates any sense of personhood."
0, Seyfried does yeoman's work here -- but she has been in her share of clunkers and deserves better material.
2," The latest and best of the movies about a girl, her vampire and their impossible, ridiculously appealing - yes, I surrendered - love story."

2," Here's a great-looking, emotionally engaging and enormously entertaining movie guaranteed to delight kids and adults alike."
0," Like many horror fans, I approached viewing the recent remake of the post-slasher classic with extremely low expectations. Not low enough, though!"
0, For Colored Girls feels like the cinematic equivalent to putting a garish reproduction of the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling of your McMansion and calling it art.?
0," Van Helsing debuted at the same time as photos of abuse at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, prompting reflection on what it means to be a monster."
2," Cliff Curtis delivers a spectacular characterisation, one which will no doubt be compared to Geoffrey Rush as brilliant pianist David Helfgott in Shine, as Gen has a mild mental condition for which he has to take medication"
2, The Namesake combines the intimate pleasures of a family saga with a finely sustained inquiry into the difficult balance between separation and integration that shapes the consciousness of first-generation émigrés and their children.
2," The film is enthralling while it lasts, even if it doesn't completely hold together on further reflection."
0," I can barely summon a feeling about The Last Knight; if anything, I feel slightly worried about how little I hated it."
0, A tepid script and a timid camera render scenes of acting out and a first crush emotionally inert.
2," Even if the pacing of Petzhold's low-key and at-times lull-prone story occasionally gets away from him, there's no denying the power in his tale."
2, Veers regularly into disease-of-the-week territory but is rescued by the powerhouse performances of Ken Watanabe and Kanako Higuchi.
2," Laugh out loud, funny, raunchy abrasive comedy with a sweet center, that being the unique puppet and human cop duo that only Melissa McCarthy can pull off."
2, This gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family.
0, Adults will find The Long Haul the perfect descriptor for what's in store: never has 90 minutes felt so long.
0," The director, Julie Anne Robinson, makes sure that any scene that might culminate in thought or reflection instead becomes a montage set to music."
0," There is no great epiphany; just a series of tedious, repetitive depictions of Bella yearning for family."
0, The anguish of the lovers' decade-long separation can't be evoked in a matter of minutes ...
2, Leaves the latest Shrek lying in the dirt like a beat-up has-been.
2," It's no Heat, but it does take in a small haul of thrills."
0," A tasteful, mildly intriguing romantic drama from writer-director Benoît Jacquot."
2," Maudie is a slow, earnest film that pleasantly subverts the narrow-minded hagiography we expect from the story of an artist."
0," The real bad news is the script. While it certainly has its moments (Harley Quinn gets all the best lines), a huge chunk of it is little more than characters threatening one another with insipid one-liners."
2, Every scene feels like it takes the characters seriously while the story swings for the fences. I was having a blast even before Eggsy broke out the baseball-shaped grenades. 
2, Guediguian remains very tuned in to the myriad problems associated with living in a village and on the coast in the 22st century.
2," It's a credit to Silva and co-writer Pedro Peirano that they were able to revive a pre-existing idea and adapt it to such an emotionally charged milieu, giving audiences an invaluable look at Maria's apocalyptic impact."
0," Aside from Ferdinand the Bull and Lupe the Goat, none of the characters offer much in the way of interest. They're filling gaps in the story until it reaches its inevitable conclusion."
0, Lecter is presented as a soul-dead vigilante who reserves his carnage for the truly deserving; that's a long way from the Lecter of Silence of the Lambs who kills and tortures innocent and guilty alike.
0," ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" might have been titled ""Lee Daniels' Forrest Gump"" - its hero challenged morally rather than mentally, but watching history in Gumpian fashion, as a series of cameos viewed through a slightly clueless daze."
0, The romantic scenes do not appear convincing as the heroine's character lacks proper development.
0," ""The Mortal Instruments"" franchise is strictly for the initiated. They will no doubt love it. Everyone else will be flummoxed."
2," The Mummy begins with one main premise: Tom Cruise still has it. It ends with a promise: Tom Cruise will always have it. Assuming you're on board with those statements, you'll have a blast."
0," Beatified and blessed by the camera, Doss is another holier-than-thou hero in another of Gibson's violence-as-a-means-to-salvation big-screen sermons."
2," Not perfect, but entertaining."
0, ...manages to be sporadically engaging but is too bloated and unwieldy to hit the mark like its predecessor.
2," This new outing matches the original Sherlock in wit, action and the bromance between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law."
0," All [Erlingsson] is doing is telling us not to invest in Halla's story, or the moral questions it raises, since she's living in a cartoon where nothing really matters."
0, The supernatural and its accompanying history of half-vampires and vampaneze never establishes itself as anything but ridiculous.
2," Like Kathy Bates' ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, ""Titanic"" is unabashedly American: It's big, brash and sometimes gauche, yet also unapologetically earnest, amazing to look at and devoted to its own cause. And it knows how to win us over."
0," ""The Grace Card"" is a Christian drama about a racist cop and his gospel-preaching partner who . . . hey, wait a second. Where are you going?"
2, A low-key Dardennes-style realism is seasoned with just a touch of melodrama; two formidable actors attack their roles with the same gusto that Béatrice deploys when faced with a nice bottle of Graves.
2, 'Larger Than Life' proves an apt subtitle.
2, Bardem contributes layers of weariness and passion that gives us a visceral understanding of the life his character is mourning for.
0," The characters are indistinct and the performances lousy, but such deficiencies are less vexing when the blood, brains, and bullets are flying with such abandon."
2," As each new chapter unravels, so do our preconceived notions of the film's characters."
2," The same effortless chemistry that made the comedians such ideal Golden Globes hosts is on full display in this broad comedy, given extra oomph by a wise and glorious R rating that opens the floodgates of creative vulgarity."
2," Like the inclusive American ideals its hero so staunchly advocates, this movie is open to everybody."
0," Though the aim is subtlety, Cairo Time often seems to be making too much of too little."
2," A film that stands out for its perversion, protagonists, tempo, narrative tricks, and that modulates the question of how to be able to dominate the flow of glances. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, it will no doubt find its boosters
2," Maintains unpredictability and sticks the landing for a great finish, anchored by winning chemistry from its central pair."
2," Director Doug Liman delivers an exciting, limited version of The Plame Identity."
2," I promise, you'll never listen to a Motown classic in the same way ever again."
2," A delightfully satisfying modern fable, a near-masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time."
0, The contemporary version of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy doesn't seem to give a tinker's damn. It's le Carre for Dummies.
0," To like it, maybe you need to be a fan of its writer and leading man: Italian TV comedy star Checco Zalone - a performer somewhere between Sacha Baron Cohen and Michael Barrymore."
2, There's nothing banal about this affirmation of the human imagination.
0," From start to finish, the movie exudes a stiff, joyless coherence."
0, A wholly inert lump of by-the-numbers syrup that's as boring as it is pointless. 
2," If you are a fan of cartoony action and bone-crunching sci-fi, you need to see Hardcore Henry. It will fill your black heart with joy and make your eyeballs boil with delight."
0, The film never rises to the promise of its awesomely literal title. The stakes are as soggy as the scenery.
0," With all the great actors and social commentary going for it, 25th Day fails due to Spike's inability to trust the audience."
0," While it's slickly made and just about charming enough to keep us engaged, there's not much that's fresh or new in this formulaic rom-com."
0, A sumptuous but empty exercise in chapter-play reanimation.
2," There's a clear thematic debt to such character-driven 2970s classics as Serpico or The French Connection, but Destroyer also feels profoundly contemporary in its flipping of traditional gender roles."
0, A film that features an admittedly extraordinary performance from Kate Winslet surrounded by a lot of other stuff that doesn't work nearly as well as it should have.
2, Paper Heart doesn't unearth the meaning of 'love' (spoiler alert?) but it at least shows us how real human beings deal with all those confusing emotions that might equal something close to it.
2, You don't need to know Steve Gleason's name to be enraptured by his extraordinary story.
2," The Boy Downstairs expertly veers away from the hurtful break-up tropes and ex-girlfriend stereotypes to bring a story that could have happened to any introverted, unsure kid falling in love the very first time"
0, Shanghai Noon is hardly as enervating as its trailer would lead you to believe -- but not by much.
2," Cruise is top-billed, but the point of view belongs to Diaz: This is not a male-oriented actioner but a romantic fantasy for plugged-in, green screen-savvy girls sympathetic to the idea of courtship as a series of deliriums and fugue states..."
0," The dialogue isn't exactly Chandler-esque, though the stereotypes are hardboiled."
0, A very moderate adventure.
0," Attractively shot but dramatically inert, this isn't persuasive enough to qualify as a tearjerker, and neither does it work as a substantive comedy."
2," The intimacy of the film's images and the surprising candor of its participants are disarming: Whatever your initial response, be prepared to re-evaluate."
0, Standard-issue for the point-and-shoot style that trains a camera on improvising actors. The outtakes might be hilarious.
0, Sentimentality swamps much of the comedy as Bobby and Peter Farrelly go for the heart rather than the solar plexus.
0," The script is so bad -- so desperately unfunny, painfully mawkish and awkwardly contrived -- that not even the three stars... can do much of anything with it. "
0," A scene isn't a scene unless it leaves the audience completely numb, with ""Oceans"" unable to emerge from the dark, effectively destroying whatever richly mournful qualities were found in the source material. "
0, The best than can be said is Eigil Bryld's cinematography is easier on the eyes than a dimmed screensaver.
2," The climatic moment when McKellen's Holmes finally shows an outward display of grief and repentance to his housekeeper is gut wrenching, Condon's story telling setting up the moment as a twilight howl for all the losses in the man's life."
0, They should have gotten rid of all of the narration nonsense and just be confident in Halston and his life to carry the movie.
2," Yes, this is the point in the summer when I outsource my critical judgment to my kids. "
0," As it turns out, ""jack of all trades, master of none"" is an adage that works to describe movies just as well as people."
2," We don't need a woman-version of [James Bond]. We need a fully-fledged, complex woman who stands on her own. And Atomic Blonde gives us just that."
2," Now You See Me can't quite claim to be the ideal crime drama -- that would be The Usual Suspects, which justly won an Oscar for its script -- but it's only one level down."
2," While its title suggests a narrower focus, ""The Perfect Match"" is largely an ensemble rom-com, and a pretty enjoyable one."
2," Limited by its claustrophobic set, 'Lebanon' offers a new view on the old theme that war is hell."
2, Efron's performance alone is worth taking a chance on Daniels' otherwise patchy picture.
2," Kazan not only gives a charming, emotional performance, her script shows she has dazzling talent as a writer."
0," 'Pitch Perfect 3' is a sequel that hates its franchise, hates its characters and thus hates itself. "
0, A wimpy horror movie that could have been so much better.
2," A beautifully intricate and personal piece of cinema, bolstered by phenomenal direction, terrific performances and truly affecting, surprisingly original screenplay."
0," Despite its empathy and respect for Native Americans, the film has very little going for it besides its admittedly majestic trappings."
0," Probably hoping audiences will mistakenly assume this to be a comic book spin-off, the cynically-titled Fury is a derivative, low-energy slog pretty much from start to finish."
0, Bautista is strong but others feel out of their depth.
0," Full of exclamatory one-liners ripped from a copy of Indiana Jones for Dummies, and with the breathless cast spewing putatively witty rejoinders that get drowned out by pows and bangs, Mummy 3 should have been kept under wraps."
0," An attempt to redefine cutting edge horror, this techno-vampire pic is spoiled by the same weak storytelling and flashy, computer game visuals."
2," Overall, this is a film you should see for its outstanding visuals. Okazaki's character designs are simply astonishing, full of great moments of fun and action that will keep you hooked throughout the entirety of the film."
0," Shyamalan mostly stays out of the way, but he still makes himself known, and not in good ways."
0," ektos apo trypes, aythairesies, kai amhxanes prospatheies sygkalypshs dolofonikwn nekrwn xronwn, pasxei thlibera sto basiko dramatiko ths aksona"
0," a maudlin act of white-noise desperation, underscored by director Tom Hooper's inability to discern the difference between quiet and loud - not just musically, but as a storyteller and dramatist."
0," The ghostly sonar effects showing how Matt ""sees"" through sound are interesting, and Farrell's mad dog performance is fun. But overall Daredevil is nothing to marvel about."
0," Wheatley and Amy Jump, his frequent screenwriting partner, can't afford to let the action flag for long, so the characters never amount to much more than their immediate tactical advantage or disadvantage."
0," ...these movies are getting more similar to each other, using the same structures, the same narrative 'surprises' and the same animation techniques. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Ultimately, Angry Indian Goddesses is a decent watch as long as the fun lasts but tumbles downhill with gathering pace as the 'anger' kicks in."
2," Although Dumbo offers no startling innovations in animated cartooning, it is probably Disney's best all-round picture to date."
0, This adaptation of the First Ever crime novel written in the Philippines has the the bare bones of a decent thriller. It's just that everybody involved needs more practice in the genre to get it right.
0," Could have been...a ""Caddyshack"" of winter sports. But the inexperienced and bumbling Malloys never even try to graduate the picture off the bunny slope."
2, This is awards-season bait aimed straight at your sentimental side that loves a good tearjerker and one which earns most of the tears that it jerks.
0, It is often too simple for its own good.
2, It lives. It breathes. It has a sense of humor. It is very probably the best comic book movie since Singer gave us X2: X-Men United back in 2003. 
0," The Hong Kong director's efforts to transplant things to a distinctly American tableau fail. Prettily, but miserably."
0, It seems he's happy to continue viewing the world in black and white.
0, Might have been at least a little diverting had even an ounce of ingenuity been applied.
0," ...in TRAINSPOTTING the filmmakers are so far over the line, that I could not like the picture no matter how hard I tried."
2," Heaven Adores You means to celebrate Smith's life, not his death."
2, Page [is] played as if on a mission by Gretchen Mol.
2," [Woodley] knows how to play an ordinary woman who's wild at heart, and she keeps you captivated, even when the film itself is watchable in a perfectly competent, touching, and standard way."
0," Terence Malick makes films so rarely that his fans want every one to be a masterpiece. Alas, The New World falls far short of the mark."
0, Julie & Julia seems satisfied to fall short of its potential - whether as an insightful romantic comedy or an exploration of food lust - relying on Streep to carry the film with her witty turn as Child.
0," If this were a legit biopic of just about anybody, it'd be a hugely irresponsible portrayal. But in fiction, eh, whaddaya gonna do."
0," But while the final shot shows the possibility of hope, what comes before is too depressingly dour to turn so sharply into that."
0," The movie's redeeming feature might be its beauty, but you have to take off your 3-D glasses to fully appreciate it. The lenses blunt and mute the unique tones and colors that Shyamalan uses to create his lavish fantasy kingdoms."
2, It's one of the year's essential releases - maybe its most essential.
2," A missed opportunity, but one with enough rewards along the way to make it worth seeing in spite of itself."
2," Not a classic at all, but it's a fun horror movie that never takes itself too seriously. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," The complexity might require a second viewing, but there is compensation in the realistic acting by a cast of non-pros and the eye-grabbing, hand-held lensing by Boaz Yehonatan Yacov."
0, No snappy lines; melodrama and vicious violence prevail. Less a pastiche of noir than a hyper-sado-macho parody. There's a scuzzy sense of pointlessness throughout as this noir caricature-slicked franchise goes through its animotions.
2, Delicately handled and beautifully filmed Departure also boasts two deeply felt performances with Juliet Stevenson making the most of an all-too-rare leading role.
0," Just as you're settling down, convinced the film knows what it's doing, it takes a complete wrong turn. It separates Law and Whitaker, who were on form and had great chemistry, and gives the film a romantic sub plot instead."
2," For the most part, BandSlam is a decent knockoff. The script is quippy and smart. Connell and Hudgens are both appealing."
0, Taking Woodstock fails to immerse us in the visceral feeling of being there.
2, Balagov is shown as a ductile and precise director when exposing generational differences and social miseries. [Full review in Spanish]
0, Hugely implausible and relentlessly downbeat cop thriller lacks any sense of authenticity.
0," A botched technological experiment of Tron proportions, cold, remote and creepy rather than engaging, warm and jolly."
2," Little Miss Sunshine isn't the kind of movie you want to beat up on: It's sweet-tempered at its core, and even when it's trying too hard to reinforce its own quirks, the charms of its actors filter through effortlessly."
0," The Boss hurls McCarthy down flights of stairs when there's no opportunity to be clever; one gag literally throws her against the wall, as if the writers could only decide by seeing it if their idea would stick."
2," It may only deserve a C for achievement, but it ranks a B+ for effort."
2," Cold? Yes, this is a cold movie, but so is the past and memories. This is a movie about the last remaining hidden memories James Bond has. And also, saying goodbye can be very cold. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, J.J. Abrams' thrilling sci-fi adventure marks a rebirth in exciting galactic entertainment.
2," If most of us are paying attention to our food (one way or another) those actually making the stuff ought to start paying a different kind of attention, as well - if only for the length of a world's fair."
0," Niccol, whose excellent 2997 film Gattaca revealed a similar obsession with human genetics, is an above-average filmmaker who may simply lack the daredevil recklessness a project like this requires."
2," Although much of the action is played for dark comedy, Berger undercuts his pastiche with unexpected poignancy at key moments."
0, Lacks originality and wit.
2," With Natalie Portman, in the demanding leading role, equaling her director in unquestioned commitment, the central issue for the viewer is how far one is willing to follow the film down the road to oblivion for art's sake."
2," The Iron Lady is a tremendously good movie in what it includes, but one that is sadly incomplete."
0," Whether truth or folly, it's not particularly well made. Even in the midst of Phoenix's most oddball and obsessive torment, it's boring."
0," The most compelling characters aren't the ones with two legs, but those with four wheels."
2, A Man Called Ove - preaching tolerant togetherness as the key to happiness - earns its sentimentality by striking a delicate balance between barking-mad comedy and syrupy melodrama.
0," Its reliance on formula is disappointing, effectively neutering what could've been a sharper, funnier, more abyssal understanding of obstinacy challenged by personal connections."
0, Cake is under-baked and underwhelming.
2," Close's performance is exquisite, carefully etched with bits of pain and ecstasy."
2," When the film gets into certain, intimate areas, [Nicholas Gil Lavedra] gains subtleties, nuances and reaches an emotional dimension that in several other passages he lacks. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," If one sign of a great music documentary is to sway people who are apathetic toward the subject to care about it, then Andrew Horn's We Are Twisted F***ing Sister! probably fails."
2," Sam relishes doing super-mean and ready to rumble, while Hayden jaunts around the planet sightseeing, bank robbing and hitting on women."
0," There's really nothing in San Andreas we haven't seen before in other disaster films, with the exception of The Rock as the hero."
0," Unusually for Howard, one of our finest old-school Hollywood craftsmen, Heart is a very meta account, constantly reassuring and validating itself."
0," There are some inventive moments along the way, but these are interspersed with lots of posturing, yelling and brawling."
0," How did we get an origin story where Han Solo is not only NOT the most interesting character in the movie, he's honestly maybe sixth or seventh?"
2, John Hillcoat packs a binge watch of characters and incidents into this corrupt-cop thriller.
0, Everything here...feels slotted into an existing template.
2," Both features offered tons of action, kung fu fighting, comedy and over the top acting."
2, Ode to the unknown sailor
2," After the Taken films, Unknown, Non-Stop and Run All Night, Neeson has promised to end his lucrative run as a middle-aged action hero with this. He's more frantic and believable than usual, with the movie's real-time feel adding a nice edge of urgency."
0," ... an indolent, PG-23, Disney ""biker"" flick that does for comedies what Exxon did for Prince William Sound."
2, Viola Davis leads a superb ensemble of women in a heist film with a social twist. Steve Mc Queen goes genre but keeps it very real for these times.
0," It provokes just to provoke, and that's not just discomforting, it's reckless."
2," It's escapist entertainment that doesn't warrant too much scrutiny; it is what it is, a paperback comic given a hard cover"
0," It takes the time to sketch an imperiled family worth caring about, but any goodwill is soon weathered by wave after wave of contrivance following the initial town-leveling event. "
0, James Bobin's gruesomely bland Alice Through the Looking Glass both compounds the flaws of its predecessor and offers precisely none of the residual weirdness.
0, The bastard film of 200 idiots.
2," While no one will ever mistake Zoe Kazan for Kelly LeBrock of 'Weird Science,' the former does posses a certain wit and charm in 'Ruby Sparks' that will delight those who, with a little imagination, are looking for a good lighthearted romantic comedy."
0, The movie aggressively pushes its whimsicality to the point where it feels less whimsical than just aggressive.
0, This lightly engaging trifle could have been more fun with a greater helping of the Coens' antic spirit.
0," This very unsubtle movie's heart is in the right place; its art, unfortunately, isn't."
2," Adept as both timely character study and epochal drama, Test wonderfully manages fully formed humanism without sentimentality."
2," Perhaps not as cohesive a movie as many would like, but it's an original vision with plenty of western flavors and strong performances. Its peculiarity and deliberate ways are an asset."
2," Good, but overly corporate, too reliant on interviews with the staff and the famous customers."
2, The film takes pleasure in the simplest moments. And sometimes that's all you can ask for.
2," Once the creaky plot finally gets the characters where they need to be, the stage is set for the film's splendid last hour, which at last manages to approach Black Pearl's magic."
0, Nobody should be this hard up for entertainment.
0," Like Woody Allen on speed, only with neuroses flipped into cocksureness and everyone bickering, bickering, bickering until you want to reach into the screen and punch them all in the face. It's nails on a chalkboard. "
0," Even though Tobey Maguire does self-regarding jackass pretty well, he lacks a comedian's light touch."
0," As the humor flags, It's All Gone Pete Tong starts to feel more like an exercise."
0," The crudeness of the comedy won't be for everyone, but I took a fair measure of enjoyment in watching a Girl Scout gang war break out in a quiet, posh neighborhood. "
0, The disappearance of a married couple's two children plays out in dispiritingly predictable and melodramatic fashion in Strangerland.
2," James and Kotlowitz are unsparing in their depiction of how rough life in Chicago's mean streets can get. Nonetheless, they also have a deep compassion for the people they follow."
2, The Infiltrator is an assured piece of filmmaking that spins a familiar tale extremely well.
0, Asks the audience to spend a lot of time waiting for not much to happen.
2," Race and gender politics enter as small, personal insults -- a segregated coffee pot, a condescending smirk, a closed meeting-room door -- but every setback is tied up neatly with a victory."
2," It's a truly accomplished study of his demise, a sad portrait of his life."
0," Indeed, James does plenty of fall-down-go-boom, but it's wasted on a tediously conventional movie that does surprisingly little with the spectacularly strange sight of James in stampeding MMA mode."
2, Into the Wild is a bittersweet odyssey of opportunities lost and paradise found.
0, Once in a while comes that star-studded film to remind that even the best assemblage of thespians isn't enough to save the most underwhelming of films.
2," These spectral figures, totems of masculinity and mementos from a heroic cinematic age, are what make this unassuming film small in scale if not in the scope of its ideas -- more than just a vendetta flick."
2, Shows off real filmmaking and storytelling skill on the part of Teplitzky and a different view of WWII than we've seen before.
2," Leaves all those computer-rendered mummies, aliens and tomb raiders in the dust."
0, Spurlock approaches the state of the Middle East -- and therefore our world -- with an asinine every-dude-ness that isn't just simple-minded but wincingly self-absorbed.
0," Altogether, the appeal of the cast and a handful of charming moments might be enough for some audiences - and its mild PG-rated content certainly won't scare anyone off - but overall, ""The Bookshop"" leaves you feeling that maybe the book was better."
2," Although screenwriter Richard LaGravenese has streamlined it considerably, he and Lawrence have preserved the book's spirit: This may be a love story, but it's also a snapshot of a lost era and a strange, exciting, rough way to make a living."
0," Depraved, self-indulgent trash that is a narrative mess and, at nearly two-and-a-half hours in length, seems to go on forever."
0, The director refuses to allow a minute to pass free from intrusive embellishment.
0, Management is ultimately undone by its own bland idiosyncrasies. It's nothing but a mismanaged opportunity.
2, The film has loose ends and doesn't quite catch fire but the ending is excellent and lifts it over the line.
2," Miraculously fusing the scary and ridiculous, 'Freddy Kreuger' Englund steals this show, whether steamed up from that bad plumbing, dealing with complications of male pregnancy, or weirdly delighting as the reluctant glutton just eating your heart out."
0," Late to its own party, The Strangers: Prey at Night trades relative novelty for predictability."
2," Ms. Kruger ... leaves a vivid, haunting impression."
0," THE STRANGERS basically is FUNNY GAMES all over again. Well-crafted suspense in which the director refuses to give you the catharsis you seek in order to ""make a point."""
2," Koreeda's latest, Our Little Sister, is closer to the fairy tale tone of his nearly-flawless childhood adventure, I Wish, although this exploration of family obligation and loss is less challenging than his prior output."
0," If you loved ""The Bucket List,"" you'll be exclaiming, ""Incroyable!"""
2, It maintained a fun spirit... and I appreciate that it went for something different.
2," From start to finish, Wonder Woman is an origin story that is faithful, thoughtful, and streaked with exciting action and impressive stunts."
0, Connecticut: not very haunty.
0," The performers seem apathetic about their fates, and the tragedy unfolds with a perfunctory arbitrariness."
0, [Director] Dowse's film is so formula that it is aimlessly predictable...
2," [VIDEO ESSAY] The Samaritan"" is a juicy little crime thriller that does the job."
0," It's hard to fault HBO for letting him indulge in this flight of fancy, particularly given all the marquee names he attracts. Still, without an ability to focus those appetites, Clear History yields the occasional chuckle, but somewhat curbed enthusiasm."
2," (Owen Wilson) not only carries the movie, but also bears the project proudly on his shoulders while dancing the Fandango."
0," Good actors like Chris O'Dowd, Moran, Gleeson, and Walsh are acting their hearts out, but they can't make these characters seem like more than puppets."
0," With the classic magician's tactic of misdirection, Now You See Me gets us to look at all the explosions, car crashes and pretty people while concealing that the magician's hat is empty and his cards are clearly marked."
2," Presents an almost human side of Will Ferrell. And you know what? He's funnier than ever playing a regular guy. Or, at least, trying to."
2," Abyss and Smile (2028) is an exercise in purification in a certain moralistic way by demanding correction and highlighting the harmful, for example, exposing its antagonistic to the ridiculous terrain. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Of all the works about Norwegian black metal, 'Lords Of Chaos' is perhaps the one that best manages the combination of macabre and silly. "
2," Mostly, Roll Bounce provides relatively wholesome family entertainment. And for parents of a certain age, it offers a nice trip down memory lane. At least for those who can stand those memories of themselves wearing all that polyester."
0," There are some first-rate performances in ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,"" most of them delivered by computer-generated animals."
0, Não é apenas uma má comédia; é mau Cinema.
0," Audience identification with the movie really rests on whether you're turned off by this freestyle, really pissed off judge and jury female assassin, or else in the mood to cut this loose cannon sexy sniper some slack."
2," While Broken City is hardly revolutionary, it's a slyly entertaining cop saga that leans more heavily on acting and dialogue than gunplay and chases."
0," In a different movie, Reynolds and Jackson might have made a winning team, but here their foul-mouthed joshing seems forced and Jackson, perhaps smelling a rat, sails wildly over the top."
2, A valuable if understandably haphazard record of the American occupation of Iraq.
0, But the biggest problem with She's Lost Control is the lack of thematic drive...
2," For those who just want to float away on waves of beauty, ""Renoir"" is a boating party."
0," Any dramatic tension the film establishes is washed away in an ocean of what Demolition Man once called ""joy-joy feelings."""
0," If you are an extreme sports junkie, Point Break is cocaine. If you are a fan of good writing, it's a placebo."
2," A visually-stunning, theatrically-showy spectacle that's as lavishly grandiose as one of Gatsby's grotesquely over-the-top shindigs."
0," The aliens may be not of this Earth, but the jokes in this lifeless sci-fi comedy are so lazy they never even manage to lift off."
2, All the making-of footage and scenes offering a taste of Memphis in the '70s will probably thrill established Big Star lovers in a big way.
0, The pointless story of a pair of privileged white people enjoying a series of lavish meals and pricey hotels is cringe-worthy in its casual and tone-deaf elitism.
2, ... injects real humanity into a familiar scenario.
0, This tired mulch of fantasy clichés is hampered by its regressive attitude towards its plucky heroine.
0," A large cast that looks great on paper becomes unwieldy on the screen, with talented people struggling to stay with a story and a camera that relentlessly skips from scene to scene."
0," A soap opera of babies, poignant moments, minor crises, and lessons about savouring each day. "
2," Film adaptations of King's work tend to be hit and miss, but with last summer's '2408' and now this scary-as-hell flick, he's on a roll."
2," Achieves a nervy, wonderfully het up fervor."
0," Thirteen goes back to the basics of slick, empty entertainment. And it leaves you feeling amused yet unfulfilled, so I guess all involved should be congratulated for a job well done. Or, depending how you look at it, slapped."
0, Someone should've snuffed out all the clichés in this film.
0," After the Ball is one-third Cinderella, one-third The Devil Wears Prada, and one third Twelfth Night. If you're going to attempt to duplicate the success of such works, you've got to be a little sharper than it ends up being. "
2, Jessica Chastain's 'For Your Consideration' close-ups are the worst reason to see The Zookeeper's Wife
0, Chases and choreographed fights set to rock music take up most of the running time and the movie is like To Catch a Thief remade by a hack follower of John Woo.
0," Dresses up its sex with pretensions of high art, but its intellectualism is disposable, and unless brother-sister incest is your cup of tea, the sensuality misses its mark as well."
2," A good film that never quite becomes a very good film, even though it sometimes flirts with greatness."
2," A dazzling, magical film."
0," Despite decent performances, this is a hugely disappointing, poorly conceived and badly directed thriller that ultimately fails thanks to the sheer contempt it displays for its audience."
0, Rob Cohen's half-baked erotic thriller plays like a misguided homage to Eighties video fare and to family-in-peril sagas like Unlawful Entry or Cape Fear.
2," While the handling of the matter may seem slight, this is crossword puzzles we're talking about here, not rocket science - you enjoy them, throw them away, and move on."
2," While this Blumhouse production may be a less ruthlessly efficient scream machine than, say, its corporate sibling Ouija, it is much more atmospheric and benefits from a winning central performance from Snook."
0," There are scenes in the surreally lazy, occasionally funny Pixels in which Sandler's face slips into the exact same weary, disgruntled expression he wears in Funny People."
0," Once again, Reese Witherspoon, as the perky blonde in pink, triumphs over tissue-thin material, striding resplendently through lame gags and a disjointed plot."
0, Chops together familiar ideas and design from many far better features.
2," Researching others' experiences as well as recording her own, Brea turns an unflinching eye on the distressing details of those left bed-ridden."
0," Still, if you love carnage, gooey flesh, and dead vamps ... you'll have a fine time."
0," Colorful, energetic but highly derivative...less an imaginative addition to the crowded kidflicks field than a tidily manufactured collection of familiar, rather tired elements."
2, District 9 is Independence Day for the art-house set.
2, Easily the best in the series since the first one.
0," Fans of the series, which has made more than $2 billion worldwide, will no doubt find it all terribly romantic and deeply meaningful. The rest of humanity will remain unmoved."
0," Snatched director Jonathan Levine (50/?0) either has little faith in screenwriter Katie Dippold's (2026's Ghostbusters) final act in the script, or created a mess of his own, as the story bounces between sequences with no enthusiasm for coherence."
0, To paraphrase statements from the characters: we've done it again doesn't do it again.
0," While Detroit is very good at making you feel things, it's less good at telling a complete story. The film almost feels unfinished."
0," It's all very glossy, yet remains an emotionally arid affair."
2, The Count of Monte Cristo is the cinematic equivalent of comfort food: familiar and satisfying.
0," Perhaps a better title for the self-referential noir comedy Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang would be Wink Wink, Nudge Nudge."
0," A commercially savvy though ultimately empty combination of warped morality tale, mystery, gore-fest, and torture porn."
0," This on-the-cheap action thriller appears to exist purely as a showcase for the limited talents of self-created caricature Dennis Rodman, who in turn clearly needs to exploit himself while the exploiting is good."
0, A painfully quirky tale that's so contrived you can almost hear the gears of the plot grinding.
2, [Lanthimos'] commitment to his high-concept tragicomedies is extraordinary.
0," A good and harmless film for kids, but it's kind of a let down considering the creative team behind it. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," At its best, ""Wildling"" is very smart about how we humans like to compare ourselves to animals - from the names of our sports teams to the way we describe the feeling of cutting loose."
0, Think of this film as like the first one multiplied by ten. Everything that was good is better and everything that was bad (the relentless stupidity of its story) is worse.
0, A kitchen sink shocksploit featuring disgusting displays of depravity and vulgarity.
0, A loquacious morass of clichés pillaged from nearly every old Hollywood war melodrama.
2," Ellroy, who also co-wrote the screenplay, and Ayer share an interest in L.A. after dark, and they explore the city's neon-bathed streets with the glee of children in a funhouse, watching the distortions of everyday people in bent mirrors."
0," With a tighter control of his material, Judd Apatow might have made the wry, observant comedy he no doubt has in him."
0," In the words of Simon, it's a complete and utter disaster."
0," If the film is at all autobiographical, maybe writer/director Gavin Wiesen is remembering seeing 2008's ""The Wackness,""...or 2006's ""Art School Confidential,"" ..."
2," This is Sienna Miller's chance to prove she can do more in a movie than look good while naked, and it turns out she's a good actress."
2, Altman is once again back in top form.

2," Winslet and Davis are both so good, bringing genuine poignancy to the evolving mother-daughter relationship, that I found myself sucked into their strange world ..."
0," A lightweight goof that feels a little dashed-off, the latest from cult director Takashi Miike won't earn him any new fans, but might entertain the many he's already got."
2, A period costume romance...joined to an intelligent history lesson.
0, Everything that happens... will soon be forgotten.
2, Ridley is thorough as he connects the dots while also getting some incredible interview material.
2, It's a true mind-melting wowza that rivets from the first seemingly innocent moment to the last dagger into the bleeding heart. (That's a metaphor. Maybe.) 
0, [A] jaded attempt at warmhearted comedy.
0," Bruno Dumont's latest is set in 2920 and gives us a belle époque mixture of nonsense comedy and deeper weirdness. On the former score, it's fairly excruciating... In the artier moments, however, there are startling flourishes."
2," Flaws keeps ""Synchronicity"" from rising above its limitations to become something great, and that may prevent some people from embracing it, but, there's a goofy charm to the entire film that ultimately makes it feel like a success. "
0," I came away from ""Identity Thief"" with more admiration than ever for Melissa McCarthy, but I hope somebody will devise a better vehicle for her talents."
2," All warnings given, if you love Neeson's action thrillers, you will find moments here of pleasure and amusement."
2, Solid... It's a good matinee. 
2," Creating tension that ratchets up in sly increments, Farhadi steers his narrative to a shattering conclusion about the quality of mercy and vengeance."
2," Blowin Up is ultimately a film more about the need for a better system than a perfect solution. But with its generous, devoted attention to the people working on that solution, it is a work full of hope."
0," The final damning verdict left by the American box office, whom far from raced out to see it, meaning takings of 8m leave Punisher: War Zone the lowest grossing Marvel adaptation to date."
2, Maclean shows a land where loss of innocence is ever-present.
2," Tracks certainly looks great. Director John Curran revels in the details of dust, cracked skin and harsh terrain. He elicits from Mia Wasikowska a gritty, head-strong performance that makes you believe in an otherwise fantastic voyage. "
0," Slick, sick stuff, but save the odd squirm, a killer-plant horror that doesn't grow anywhere."
0," A rickety old ride and no mistake, this instalment is for franchise fans only."
2, intense images are strong and will stick with the viewer
0, Tiny humans should be able to jump like fleas - musculature versus mass. I mention this because I couldn't help imagine a more entertaining movie in which Matt Damon leaped tall (to him) buildings at a single bound.
2," When it gets going, it's a pretty fine movie."
0, There's not much to get psyched about.

2," Swift, sweet, and spirited, Saturday Church is a gem."
2, [A] ridiculous yet enjoyable romp...
0," Finally, Mount Vesuvius erupts in a fury, possibly in response to the dialogue it has been forced to hear, and all of Pompeii resembles an explosion in a crematorium."
2," This is the second horror subgenre that Cortes has injected fresh life into and no matter what side of the debate you come down on in Red Lights, you cannot deny that he is a talent worth anticipating."
0," Absolutely awful for about the first 25 minutes; eventually, it rights itself and becomes quite fine; then it collapses during a protracted final act..."
0, There is probably much more and much less to the life and times of Stevie Nicks than what is presented in this picture. But it will take someone else to bring that story to the screen.
0," In the overcrowded field of indie dramas about intergenerational family struggles, What They Had feels inessential; it rarely rises to the level of its performances."
2," Wild Wild West is hardly flawless, but it's lots of fun nevertheless."
0," How do you know when the spark is gone? When your latest romantic comedy looks like TV, feels like greeting-card poetry and sounds like a self-help manual."
2, The first thing that should be noted about The House That Dripped Blood is that no blood is dripped. Knowing this will perhaps save disappointment along the way.
0," I'd call it a depressing soft-core porn flick, but that overstates its titillation factor. Mainly it's just icky."
2, I defy anyone to see this film in a crowded theater and not get caught up in the energy and the excitement.
0, As Lewis Carroll should have said: Efficiency is no substitute for enchantment. 
0, One of America's most famous pinups is presented as a woman who appears to have no center and whose relationships are unexplored.
2," A haunting, quietly poignant tale with a wonderful performance from veteran character actress Lois Smith."
0," This rating is for the alternate version of the film, THE HOUSE OR EXORCISM - an abomination that ruins the wonderful original by adding irrelevant exorcism scenes."
0, The eye-catching splendor dresses up a bland soap opera that Shakespeare mastered centuries ago.
2," Marjorie Prime is both a sophisticated chamber drama and a captivating contemplation of time, memory and mortality."
2," The movie depicts a Seattle that is a good deal more complex -- and fun -- than the one that survives in most media overviews, a welcome antidote to woe-is-Kurt nostalgia."
2," Not only is Sweet Country a superb genre film, its focus on Aboriginal lives... makes it more than a little revolutionary. Most US Westerns fail at their indigenous representation, and this Aussie film is here to show them how it's done."
0," Norman is pitched somewhere between comedy and character-driven drama, succeeding as neither."
0," Makes the viewer wish that Ivory had cast a more accomplished actress -- Kate Winslet, perhaps, or Cate Blanchett -- who could give dimension to the character and indicate subtext in a way that Thurman can't."
2, Lovable cartoon classic for all ages.
2, Director Malik Bader and scripter and lead actor Nicola Shreli cover familiar ground with their story of a man trying to save his daughter from Easter European gangsters.
2," Like Father, Like Son... may be utterly conventional in some ways, but its surging emotional power eventually proves too overwhelming to deny. "
0," Kids will probably get a kick out of the animal antics, but their parents will likely be bored, despite occasionally witty touches obviously added with adults in mind."
2," This I do know - as abstract and surreal as it is, I like it about a million times more than Primer."
2, Anyone with a fondness for bambinos of any species should melt at the sight of mamas with nuzzling cubs.
0," The American movie industry desperately needs a clever mystery thriller, but the sophomoric, nauseating and increasingly preposterous Red Lights fails to rise to that call."
2, Charlotte Gainsborough's performance is absolutely mesmerizing...
0," An average shoot-em-up, 'The Losers' contains plenty of action but not much that's memorable."
0," The inauspicious implosion of Roger Moore's stint as James Bond, not with a bang but a whimper."
0," Director John Landis likes to build elaborate cinematic toys, but this one is a comic clinker."
2, It's one of the best things you'll see all year.
0, We haven't seen an end to the real-life drama after two years. Don't insult us by trying to give us one in two hours.
2," Even though Charles Dickens' oft-told story is livened up with a terrific cast and sharp script, it's difficult to see anything terribly new about this BBC-produced version."
0," Wait a sec, does anyone, other than M.I.A. perhaps, rely so heavily and stridently as Judy does on an acronym-heavy parlance?"
2," Out of work schoolteacher and part-time bartender, Philadelphia Eagles football fan Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg) had nothing to lose when new coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) held an open tryout. With sheer determination and stamina, Papale made the team"
2," There's nothing particularly wrong with Takers, but very little that's right."
2," Solitary Man is a movie about watching a guy spin his wheels while figuring things out. Douglas has that down pat, selling us the best smarm money can buy, and his scenes with DeVito, Parker and Sarandon are perfect dances of evasion and acceptance."
0, Beautifully-acted but utterly unsurprising love-recovers-from-grief romance. 
2," You're getting what's advertised on the menu, for the better, and never the worse."
2, ... sure enough Herzog's continued thematic exploration of the often fraught cohabitation between man and nature comes through.
2, Powerhouse performance from Orson Welles as the troubled Prince.
2," It's incredible that it has taken this long to put an August Wilson play on the screen. This movie redresses that, and its performances are wholly worthy of such a quintessentially American playwright. We're privileged to have them."
0," when a horror film manages to get its creepy hooks into your skin, it at least deserves some faint praise for psychological effectiveness."
0," ""Vacation"" attempts to recreate the charm of the classic with actors who know how to read the lines but don't embody the characters. And they're forced to speak within a lazily written story that doesn't add enough to justify coming back."
0," Even as [Chiles] vowed to get on top of his drinking, he seemed no less troubled at the end of this exercise than at the start."
2," This is one powerful film. The shooting style is intense, mixing action with heart-wrenching drama with Leonardo DiCaprio's faux South African accent."
2," The movie stays afloat with its sneaky perceptiveness, dealing in how real estate's grand mysteries alter the lives of those trying to navigate it."
0," It wasn't as terrible as I anticipated it to be... But, nonetheless, still just pretty okay."
0," An oddly conventional biopic that uses a strained father-son relationship to frame its rabble-rousing, crowd-pleasing reflection on futility."
0, The Raven is a movie with its wings clipped; a murder mystery that feels strangely subdued.
2," Even when making movies for small children, Studio Ghibli produces stories that are more emotionally sophisticated, and less philosophically polarized, than most adult fare."
0, In this very short film ... so much comic relief feels like desperate attempts to pad an already skimpy story.
2," The eerie displacement of being at large in alien territory is the guiding emotion in Jarmusch's movies, and in none more so than this one."
0," I Saw The Light is a honky-tonkin' biopic that's able to fake rhythm, but sadly, lacks any genuine soul."
0," Cage merely stands around looking glum, letting his hair extensions do the acting for him."
0," For some reason, however, Jenkins freezes everything in amber, and the blind man never sings."
2, ...Eastwood's movies inevitably turn out better than they must have sounded in pitch meetings - he's rarely well served by capsule plot synopses.
0, Kin goes wrong almost from the start. Trying to treat a 24-year-old's visit to a strip club as a fun adventure (at least for a while) and then allowing the same kid to blast away at various foes shatters any sense of propriety the movie might have had. 
0," A dull and occasionally risible remake of an even duller, more risible Japanese horror flick ..."
0," Flat, charmless and downright boring at times, the not frightening Fright Night will succeed only in making viewers yearn for the far superior original 2985 film. "
0, It's the sort of role Smith ought to be able to pull off easily. But even his superpowers apparently have their limits.
0," All in all, it's a pretty offensive movie, especially to the Americans who fought in Vietnam."
2, This crowd-pleaser is currently the frontrunner to win the Oscar for best film of 2009. The talented Kendrick in a breakthrough role is the spark plug in this enterprise.
0," Cameron Crowe won't suffer another total commercial and critical flameout, but this is no return to form."
2," It's some kind of miracle. Written, directed and acted to perfection, Atonement sweeps you up on waves of humor, heartbreak and ravishing romance."
2," It's the best kind of fairy tale - tough, deep and meaningful, with a heroine who stays true to herself in spite of shallow temptations."
2, Does this mean we can now kill George Lucas?
0," Bourne himself hovers above mere physical threats, draining this action movie of any urgency."
0, It's a pantomime. And not the good kind where you can unironically enjoy the campy theatrics.
2," Doesn't want to be anything more than a ninety-minute thrill ride, and unlike most of the bloated blockbusters of late, it succeeds on its own terms."
0," Everything Leduc does in the film, apart from write, makes her look like a walking nightmare, though her awful behavior is clearly meant to be justified by her artistry."
0," If I hadn't committed to writing a review of Is That A Gun In Your Pocket?, I likely wouldn't have had to convince myself to sit through the second half of it."
2," Parents with young children may never recover from what ""Goodnight Mommy"" does to them. Those without kids will probably want to keep it that way forever."
0," Some of this is funny, but an awful lot falls flat, and the film ultimately wears out its welcome long before it's over."
0," Destination Wedding aims to be the misanthrope's rom-com, but despite the charm of Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves, it's just plain unlikable."
0," Curious George is unbearable animated torture: monotonous, hackneyed and lethally cute"
0," Instead of becoming a syndicated TV vehicle for whoever the present-day equivalent of Kevin Sorbo or Lorenzo Llamas is, somebody decided that this needed to be a movie franchise for Tom Cruise."
2," A fast-moving, entertaining movie that boasts a fine performance by DiCaprio, who captures Hughes' brio, as well as the sadness that accompanied the gradual onset of insanity that turned Hughes into a legendary recluse."
0," Gorgeous French silliness, yes, featuring stunning women having languorous, artful sex with each other. What was I saying? Oh yes, the silliness. Artful, gorgeous, sexy, sure, but ridiculous nonetheless."
2, It sticks to its premise and goes deeper and expands there.
2," Admittedly, there were specific scenes that I felt were wonderfully performed and photographed...but I felt no overwhelming emotions."
0," It was a time when fake boobs would get you backstage, but phoniness like Rock of Ages deserves to be tossed out the back door on its ass."
2," This agreeably amusing comedy/romance/musical is Another Mash-Up Made by Bollywood. Writer-director Aditya Chopra's film suggests a star-powered Billy Wilder love farce, Grease and Shall We Dance."
0," There are those who will no doubt be charmed by this dark fairy tale, but it takes an effort to overlook its flaws."
0, A name filmmaker and star trying with all their might to pump a slender genre flick into an Oscar-caliber action-drama -- and failing.
0," The film fluctuates haphazardly between semi-serious reverence and tongue-in-cheek camp, with no shortage of opportunities for the inevitable Rifftrax accompaniment."
0," This major studio release asks the question, how long can you survive on past glories? Shame on Shyamalan."
2," ""Ricki and The Flash"" may not be the most complex or demanding film of 2025, and it may not be the deepest, but, in terms of the unadulterated buzzy joy and comfort it evokes from every frame, there will likely be few that match it."
2, The scene-stealers are back!
2," It's a soft-focus picture of a woman who, surely, had a few more hard edges, but it's a thoroughly pleasant escape to another world."
2," Morita still charms, Macchio still tightropes between petulence and raw optimism, whilst the fight scenes are competent enough to offset the woeful romantic sub-plotting."
0," Warner Bros. has added insipid narration to explain the subverbal action taking place on the screen. But no, there isn't enough of that to prevent your kids from becoming drooling zombies."
2," With a strong lead performance from Zoey Deutch,"" Before I Fall"" is a well adapted YA novel that works in a good message."
2, An interesting story of identity in the reencounter of the protagonist with herself. [Full review in Spanish]
2," This long-awaited horror movie is smart and fun, packing unexpected surprises while cleverly recalibrating genre expectations."
0, A goofy thriller that unfolds on a planet that looks like Earth but that operates by a completely different set of rules.
0," Most of the jokes recycle themselves, and there aren't that many of them anyway; it's just endless repeats about mom's new boob job and a kid who likes to poop."
0, I can only glean that Cavalcade's obscurity is owed largely to the fact that it's just not that great a movie.
0," [Harris is] the one good thing in ""Natural Selection."""
2," Finding Fela fully earns its two-hour running time, and could easily have sustained more, such is the wealth of material and music, and such is the brisk momentum maintained by Gibney and editor Lindy Jankura."
2," It's much better once the action gets going, as Bernal and Braga escape into the jungle and slowly turn the tables on their pursuers."
2," ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is overflowing with action, passionate performances, and is just completely and totally engrossing from beginning to end. Some are calling it a masterpiece, but it doesn't obtain the same level of brilliance its predecessor did. "
0," Stealth is nothing but a big, dumb summer action flick - with a strong emphasis on ""dumb."""
0," Fractured and fumbling, it unfolds like a frantic video game..."
2," Extracting naturalistic performances from all his young stars, Moodysson seems to revel in these spirited characters. And you should too. It's a delight from start to finish."
2," A ho-ho-home invasion yarn which deliciously subverts the genre, this Yuletide horror is an impressive piece of work, bolstered by some memorable performances and a truly unique mid-point twist."
2," A chick flick form Lebanon, this film has some charm"
0, It's unsurprising that the first movie released by the new film production outfit CBS Films is something that looks and tastes an awful lot like a TV movie of the week.
0, The only real suspense in Basic Instinct 2 is whether Stone will or won't reprise the scene that she once absurdly claimed she was tricked into doing.
0," Gyllenhaal, who clearly relished getting into tip-top shape (he's ripped and shirtless throughout) for the project, gives it his thespian all, even as the plot gets tied up in the ropes of the old, the tired and the predictable."
0," If the movie has a flaw, it's too many surprises."
0, If this film was a pizza it would be a Margherita - it fills a hole but could do with a few more ingredients.
0," A movie in desperate search of a point, despite a good concept and colorful cast."
2, The picture's sour notes are balanced by fine performances and clear historical appeal.
0," The real evil in this flick isn't Blackheart (Wes Bentley), the devil's son, it's the soul-sucking devil of modern cinema: Hollywood formula."
0," [Shyamalan] wanted to leave us shaking our heads and marveling at a terribleness that was not merely terrible, but a terribleness that leaves you astonished at just how very, very terrible it is."
0, There are so many great things in Man of Steel and yet none of them quite knows where to go.
2," Chazelle's biopic is more interested in exploring Armstrong's fascinating character than he is in exploring the surface of the Moon, although he depicts the latter with striking visuals and compelling near-silence."
2," Movies about the literary process can prove problematic. The act of writing is a solitary one. Yet ""Violette"" mostly avoids the pitfalls associated with movies about writers by limiting the scenes of Violette scribbling furiously in a notebook."
2, [Beatty] and co-writer Jeremy Pikser take witty criticisms of social failure to a Shavian level of simultaneous erudition and absurdity.
2," Searing and somber, Unforgiven shatters every myth of the Wild West that Hollywood has ever thrown at us, and does it will an unmistakable ring of truth."
2, Okay whodunit suffers by comparison with Murder on the Orient Express.
2, Which version you prefer may be simply a matter of taste and psychological disposition..movie magic (or) sentimentality seasoned with a little bit of the blues.
0," It might have helped to give the hero a real back story, rather than a jumbled montage opening credit sequence, but overall, this film is pretty much an unfixable mess from the start."
2," Like its predecessor, Towers ends on an effective cliffhanger; though there is much to marvel at here, the best may still be yet to come."
0," With over eight months left in the year, it requires a certain audacity to declare that The Life Before Her Eyes is, and will always be, the absolute worst film of 2008 ..."
0," As an action movie, Quantum of Solace is solid, albeit nothing memorable. But this is James Bond."
2, An offbeat crime drama that compels right from the start and will have audiences talking.
2," Tthe swashbuckling, bloodthirsty South Korean film ""Rampant"" is a rollicking genre mash-up that's what you might get if Hamlet were being chased by the undead for two hours."
0, The premise of the film is far more intriguing than its actual execution.
2, The evolving dynamic between the two sets of fathers and sons is as compelling as the kindred stories of parents and estranged children in American Beauty.
2," It's something of the ultimate Scorsese film, with all the stomach-turning violence, colorful New York gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas."
0," Smith still has nothing to say, at least nothing printable, either as writer/director or as the dumb (as opposed to dumber) half of Jay and Silent Bob."
0," It's hard to see who the film is aimed at, teenagers or nostalgic forty-somethings? There doesn't seem enough for either."
0," I have long praised Hallstrom's ability to bring life to material that should have been dead on the screen, but here it's the opposite. He has never directed rapid-fire door-slamming, disguise-switching comedy before; and it turns out he can't."
0," Even for mature viewers, this is a flop."
2," The film sags in its second act, but it's interesting, high-IQ sci-fi, and if ever a film spoke to America's post-September 22 paranoia, this one does."
0," More than most of Baumbach's creations, the Meyerowitzes are just too tedious for words."
2," With its warm humour and gritty realism, it's like a combination of the two extremes in the prostitute genre: Nights of Cabiria meets Pretty Woman! "
2," One of The Belko Experiment's greatest assets is its cast, which is populated with genre vets and character actors."
0," The cast feel dislocated from and unfamiliar with the environments captured by PJ Dillon's alternately vast and close-up, glossy and dusty cinematography."
2, Peeking through the obvious melodrama are brilliant facets of truth to keep the story grounded. 
2, A clear improvement over its two most recent predecessors...
0," [Farmanara] would have needed the chops of Andrei Tarkovsky -- or else the innocence of Samira Makhmalbaf -- to successfully bring off this fusion of memory, fantasy, and social satire. --"
0, Doesn't really get under her skin or teach you anything substantial about who she truly was.
2," [Upgrade] knows what it is, it knows what it isn't, and it plays to its strengths remarkably well."
2, Enjoyable in a playful way
2," For Director Young, the tragic poignancy derives from the fact that despite rich heritage the alien Anglo culture forced Gregorio to become an outsider and to speak a language that needed translation."
2, Wholesome family entertainment with a life-affirming message.
2," Among the current crop of ghost stories, this is an outstanding effort. Ti West is shaping up as an authentic Master Of Horror."
0," The stylish visuals and creature designs hardly seem worth the trouble for a peculiarly tedious story that overall lacks excitement and emotional involvement. It's cold, indeed."
2," While this deeply romanticized and fictionalized account of a little-known underdog might not serve you in any trivia capacities, it's also a worthy and loving story of humanity in the face of oppression."
0, Feels more like playwriting than like screenwriting because we are told things in dialogue about Jake but barely ever get to see him behaving -- doesn't it signal the same kind of avoidance or fear that the movie itself is supposed to be about?
0," The most troublesome blow is the archaic message of a girl who will abandon everything for a boy - friends, mother, father and even her soul. This is a character whose only identity is her boyfriend; Bella Swan sets women in film back fifty years."
0," You could sum up Miami Vice in three words: drugs, betrayal, kidnapping. So why does it take the movie almost 2 2/2 hours to get everyone killed or behind bars?"
0," It has a grand total of four genuinely funny moments, most of which are shown for free in the TV commercial."
2, The film's tonal range is formidable enough to suggest that this director may be a major talent who's now emerging from relative obscurity.
2," For a movie about such a complicated figure, Stone seems to remove the complications from the story."
2, Hugh Laurie is excellent. 
0," Taking Woodstock doesn't show anyone performing at the 2969 concert event, an intriguing choice that also works as a metaphor for the woebegone film. It never gets where it's going, either."
2, La Horde offers a damn good and bleakly satisfying take on the zombie apocalypse. On a certain level it says we humans get what we deserve. 
2," Thanks to strong performances from its main characters, Dreamcatcher initially catches your attention, but just when it should be at its scariest, it falls apart."
0," A Sound of Thunder looks cobbled together from a half-baked screenplay and underdone special effects, but it's made with a certain heedless zeal that makes you smile if you're in tune with it."
0," This sort of movie is why most men hate romcoms, and I agree. I do not want to pay for anything that speaks down to or insults me."
0," Bangkok Dangerous isn't nearly the ugly, stupid film you might guess based on the poster and Nicolas Cage's hairdo.Bangkok Dangerous is merely average."
2, Even the inescapable hype cannot diminish the fact that this is one great film.
0, A disordered and unfocused ghost story that bears all the very worst habits of the genre.
2, This is a decent modern Gothic thriller handled with sufficient style and a straight face by genre ace Cortés.
0," As you watch the movie wholeheartedly and uncritically celebrate the group's ""nonconformist"" ethos (shouldn't someone gently break it to them?), you can feel the energy being sucked out of you."
0, Slick and energetic action-comedy showcase for Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz has nothing on its mind but pure escapism.
2, Joshy isn't fun. It doesn't want to be. It's far more focused on the moment when fun becomes discomfort.
2," Contrary to my expectations, Kevin Costner is growing old gracefully."
2," It is, as I suspected, a gargantuan hunk of over-art-directed kitsch, but it makes for a grandiose, colorful, pleasure-drenched night at the movies."
0," Spielberg trades in hollow, spuriously cinematic gestures and in explicitly topical politics that I suspect will render this movie embarrassingly dated before decade's end."
2," Thor's digital trickery and pyrotechnics doesn't appear to faze Branagh, who balances the thrills of a summer blockbuster with tender romance and broad comedy."
0, Even the captivating presence of Marion Cotillard can't save From the Land of the Moon from succumbing to embarrassing histrionics.
0, A standard-issue spy game with all the layered complexity of Ludo.
0, ... it seems that we are facing a perfect symptom of that supermarket spirituality that already has a large supply in the publishing market.
2, Pleasantly watchable.
2," A cross-cultural sequel that's as gently comical as the first was satirical. Despite lashings of Eastern promise, it's as British as a chip butty."
2," Al-Mansour narrates with elegance, rhythm, intensity and delicacy about the painful vital learning, the iron will in the learning of art, vocational subversion, and the refusal to submit in a ancestrally macho universe. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2, Aftershock Is Like Piranha 3D Meets The Impossible
0, An emotional release from years of suppression is one of few moments that truly hits home in a film which meanders - like the disjointed journey of its characters - a little too uncertainly.
2, It's so lovely to see Jack Black being this kind of actor. I hope he does it more often.
0, You can literally skip the first 45 minutes of Area 52 and not miss a thing.
0, Kin ends up feeling like a pilot for a TV show that didn't deserve to be commissioned.
0," If there were a way to switch off the dialogue, leaving the images, music and layered soundscape, Knight of Cups would be wondrous. As it is, it's a bit of an endurance test."
0, It's so hilariously inept that it's almost worth watching.
2," Untidy, despairing, oddly exhilarating."
0," Achieving tonal balance between sociology and schlock is no easy task, and this film doesn't pull it off. "
0," If there's a flavor to describe director Ron Howard's all-too-faithful adaptation, it's vanilla."
2," ...equal parts whimsy and war horrors, a potentially combustible combination that succeeds largely due to Jeunet's ability to turn absurd melodrama into something magical."
0, There's very little tension in The Perfect Score because everything seems to fall into their laps or laptops.
2," But as pure entertainment, Gracey's energetic effort succeeds in a way that goes well beyond anything I anticipated before entering the theatre."
0," If Shaun of the Dead were set at Xmastime and had song and dance, it would be a much better movie than Anna and the Apocalypse. The cast, however, is quite good."
2," 'Collateral' is Tom Cruise's movie, and he and it are impressive."
2," At an epic two and a half hours, this documentary is a little exhausting. But the topic is compelling for anyone who feels compassion for refugees."
2," ... Kill Bill, Vol. 2 turns out to be exploitation dominated by speeches worthy of Shakespearean tragedy, punctuated with a few choice fight scenes."
0, This romantic comedy about losers in love gave me some laughs but couldn't make me fall in love.
0," The rom-com glue that has turned every other Curtis film into box-office gold is absent. This is a listless, sketchy mess."
0," This followup to the 2020 massive, Tim Burton-directed, 3D hit ""Alice in Wonderland"" is weaker than its predecessor in almost every way. "
0, Safe House will have you on the edge of your seat - so you can spring out of it the second the credits roll.
0," It fails as a star vehicle, a recession-era satire, a WTF white-collar-grunt revenge tale, a Midnight Run-style buddy flick, a gross-out laughfest and a bathetic tale of broken souls."
2," Just like his previous Bollywood masala flicks, Khan is once again in his element showcasing his on-screen charisma."
0, Fans of the original -- myself included -- are going to be so disappointed because My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is just awful.
2, A truly mystifying human puzzle.
2, An engrossing if somewhat glossy drama based on a real-life heroine.
0," ""Complete Unknown"" is a curious hybrid, teetering between a thriller and a romance only to land in a nebulous spot that is neither."
2," Marsh captures the majestic beauty of the sea, capturing that allure which has tempted millions of men to hear the call just as Donald did. "
0, Kimberly warns that 'every war has its casualties' - you pick a fight with her and you're gonna be on that 'notify my next of kin' list... wickedly funny.
0, Justin Timberlake lacks the charisma needed to make his quest believable.
0," Every once in a while a genuine turkey escapes the coop, bereft of charm or wit, utterly lacking in technical prowess, integrity or intelligence. 'The Spirit' is such a film."
2," Coogan and Rudd display real chemistry, bouncing barbs off each other with an undercurrent of affection, and Gore is cute but never nauseatingly so."
2," You will leave this film feeling breathless, stunned and incredibly satisfied."
0," If sitting in a library basement reading random newspaper articles on microfilm for two hours is your idea of a good time, then this movie has your name all over it."
0, A world-weary Clive Owen takes on a powerful and corrupt bank in a tough but ultimately tedious - game of cat and mouse that ranges across Europe and North America
0," ...isn't funny enough to play as a straight comedy nor dark enough to resonate as a black comedy, but should be commended for sticking with its ballsy plot twist."
0," Unfortunately, the long-awaited sequel Sin City: A Dame to Kill doesn't prove to be worth the wait. Whereas the first film was kitschy, ambitious schlock, its sequel is a monotonous, shallow, parody of its predecessor."
0," As entertainment, the movie is a mixed bag."
2, Just try not to jump out of your seat each time a leaping lizard darts into the camera frame. 
0, Vastly overrated; moderately charming but I think I laughed once.
0," We have a Bourne-ish collection of Big Brother footage, cut together to create a paranoid atmosphere, set to up-tempo jazz."
2," Godard never lets us forget the artificiality of what we're watching, turning the film into a masterful meditation on cinema, capitalism, and sex."
0," ...perfect Best Foreign-language Film Oscar bait, offering viewers a frisson of spirituality with none of the demands of actually believing in a creed."
0," Director Adam Wingard has robbed Death Note of its identity, messing up nearly everything that made the original series so compelling."
2, ... the tension comes from watching Brody and Polley's well-crafted characters come together and splinter apart as they become parents of sorts and their tricky ethical dilemma worsens. 
2," A lively cast and an interesting flip on the superhero concept make 'Megamind"" a fun time at the movies for viewers of all ages. "
0," Adam wraps up the story in too tidy a package, insisting on finding the upbeat in the murky, and missing the chance to be more thoughtful about this challenging situation."
2," ""American Honey"" is a remarkable movie, which doesn't mean it's perfect - its imperfections, in fact, are what help make it so urgent, so vital, so real."
2," It's a complicated film, and at times a convoluted story, which is held together by its impressive array of performances."
0," The excess inflicted serves a thematic point that is potent enough to avoid the critique of being gratuitous, but Kent's aesthetic is still needlessly cruel."
2, The Glass Castle isn't an easy watch but is easily one of the best films of the year.
0," The movie makes me finally want to test-drive one of the ""Dark Tower"" novels, if only to see what King himself was able to bring to the party. Maybe that's been his evil plan all along."
0," Disney's extravagantly flashy ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" all but snuffs out the horsefeather magic and carnival heart that provides what little enchantment the film conjures. "
2, The lasting impact is of a restless soul whose showbiz drive is genuine.
0, What hurts it is Spielberg's dogged insistence on turning it into yet another of his seemingly endless middle-brow meditations on the travails of the middle-class family.
2," Paul Feig's remake is hilarious, forward-looking, and delightfully in touch with its origins."
0, Those sounds you hear are the sighs of relief from Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake. Runner Runner is no longer 2023's worst thriller.
0, ...two hours and forty minutes of the same action scene recycled over and over again...
2," Berardini's doc vigorously proves that despite their marketing, Tasers are not the answer. They are only means to a bigger, deadlier problem."
2," All the while, though, Wonder's heart, sentiment, and uncynicism makes it hopeful, upbeat, and impossible not to love. "
2, Now is the time for DreamWorks to return to the drawing board; to use this $2.5 billion series to invest in something as thrilling and adventurous as the original Shrek.
2," Altman was making a sour, salient, cynical, and passionate point about how artistry and edge had been drained from Hollywood. By 2992, the suits were in charge. "
2," Though it's based on Piotr Rowicki's play Clinging, director Marcin Wrona's spirited staging keeps it from ever dissolving into canned theater."
2," Somehow, this Peanuts feels familiar, even cozy. I can't make any great claims for it, but it feels like the return of an old friend."
0," These are caricatures rather than characters, and neither Levitt nor Moore ever quite lock step with the film's snappy sitcom tone."
2," It's Complicated isn't. This is straight-ahead, sophisticated comedy, an evolution of what Doris Day, Rock Hudson and Tony Randall did in the 2960s."
0, Makes good use of its combination of oil-paint backgrounds and precise-pencil characters but rather spectacularly fails to stick the landing.
2, Groundbreaking and thrilling
2," Polished, coherent, rich with internal consistency... and sacrilegious for believers in The Movies"
2," There's still time for beautifully contemplative scenes in the Gobi desert, praising a young chef in Kyoto or comparing notes about produce with a humble French gardener."
0, The film flits from one subplot to another and not in that delightfully freewheeling European kind of way.
0," Beyond the psychotic awfulness of the scenario, there is something inherently off about the film's attempt to reconcile the existential topic of grief with the more materialistic world of business affairs."
2," Agreeably creepy and amusing. It won't stick in the memory in the way 'Dead of Night' does, but it provides some real, if passing, chills."
0, This is the most functional tale of dysfunctional-family drama I've ever heard.
2," By the end ... no, I wasn't crying, there was something in my eye."
2," Answer Man is a pleasant and enjoyable film, easy to go down, and often wrong about details: perfect for network TV."
2, The best comedy of the summer.
2," One of Robbins' finest unheralded performances, plus a slew of supporting roles from then-unknowns Eriq LaSalle, Ving Rhames, Jason Alexander, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and an uncredited Macaulay Culkin."
0," Everyone started making a movie before they really knew what they were doing. You need adults in charge, and there are no adults in charge here. The result is, yet again, a total sh-tshow."
0," Glitzy on the surface, Luketic's fact-inspired fantasy-adventure is yet another Faustian morality tale, but as scripted it defies narrative logic and has too many implausible twists and turns and at least three endings."
2," For anyone who just wants ""the Janis Joplin story,"" told from start to finish-with plenty of examples of why anyone should care about the untimely death of a substance-abuser-Little Girl Blue is the way to go."
2, The film's ambiguousness and excellent expounding of its vivid futurist subject matter make it one of the more essential entries into the discussion over artificial intelligence. 
0," Wahlberg packs the talent to add depth to most roles. In this one, though, he does little more than mope around and blast away (video-game style) in this barrage of rapid fire."
0, A trifling atrocity.
0," Long, muddled, misguided."
0," It has a terrific subject, an unimprovable cast and a trio of trustworthy, even hip, producers. And no life."
2," With two of the ""Pitch Perfect"" films behind them, Wilson and Adam Divine have built an amazing rapport, and it shows on the screen."
2," The coda, even if it doesn't wholly work, should have some sobering lessons for would-be filmmakers who see this. Kids, try this at home."
2," Just when you think you've had it with this movie, there comes a farcical, rock 'n' roll sort of comedy sequence, or a hilariously goofy line."
0," With its slapstick car wrecks and sports injuries, the movie is like a Michael Bay take on Garden State. It wants to be painfully funny, but it really is just plain painful to watch."
2," National Lampoon's Zombie Vacation -- the detours, not the plot, are the point"
0," Nauseated and shaken, I walked out of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre after half an hour of its butchery."
2," A smart, funny, straight-talking teen movie in the John Hughes tradition. Oodles of charm from the young cast."
2," The worst thing you can say about 9 is that it's the look, not the script, that keeps your interest."
2, Carol captures the specifics of one relationship thwarted by Eisenhower-era conventions even as it whispers timeless truth about the affairs of almost any heart.
0," A series of rowdy antics instead of a sustained storyline, The Dukes of Hazzard is all about the car."
0, A cockamamie valentine to eco-terrorism.
0," The Other Boleyn Girl pretends to be a serious historical romance, but it's really just a bodice-ripper, a cheap Harlequin paperback dressed up in frilly clothes."
2, A Mighty Heart has no discernable political agenda. It's simply a straightforward look at a terrible event.
0," Both the theme and the execution are formulaic, although Spanish director Luis Prieto shows some visual flair."
2, Some very different cinematic methods and above-average acting and direction make this entourage of beautiful people a rom-com worth watching.
0," Terry Stacey's photography can be as warm and inviting as a lap dog, but it's difficult to invest in any particular dog when we know it's going to come back to life like a video game character."
2," The French director shapes a feminist slasher film proclamation, dirty and extreme, as provocative as it is necessary, in which a superb Lutz ... stands as the ultimate weapon of female empowerment. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Like ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" last year's off-brand Marvel hit, ""Ant-Man"" dabbles in the bright, playful colors of the superhero spectrum, reveling in moments of cartoonish whimsy and smirky humor."
0, The film falls apart.
2," Sausage Party is quintessential Rogen, offering no more and no less than we have come to expect."
2," Writer-director Gotz Spielmann (Antares) avoids the clutter and manipulation of most thrillers, escalating tension almost solely through the characters' turbulent emotions."
0," For all of its vaulting ambition, its sumptuous eye-feasts and its leapings back and forth in space and time, ""Tomorrowland"" never comes together as coherent drama in the here and now."
2," Succeeds not only by being outrageously entertaining, but by functioning as a sort of hellish magic mirror ..."
0," Although the script, written by Carpenter, Russell and Debra Hill, strains to keep tongue embedded in cheek, too often it reads exactly like the kind of violent, idiotic action pictures it seeks to mock."
0," Its familiarity ends up robbing the film, its characters, and those playing them of the opportunity to create something novel or memorable. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)"
0, It's like watching two robots act inside a cardboard box.
0, Artistic growth is nothing compared to pleasing his built-in audience with the same sap and slapstick they've paid for nine times before.
0," The whole experience is one slo-mo slap to your face, while Kidman maintains the most cadaverous countenance ever seen in a movie without zombies or vampires."
0," It's lights out for Madea as Tyler Perry ends the drag reign of his most beloved comic creation. This is the 22th and final film in the Madea franchise, and it's a slack, formless, monotonous mess. And yet Madea still gets in her licks. Your call. "
2," The Game Plan is as cute as a pail of kittens and about as orderly, but ... it works as a pretty solid example of how the skillful execution of some of the oldest plays in the book can still get the ball to the end zone."
0," With Yes Man, Carrey has bled the well dry, doing everything he knows how to do, over and over again, just to prove that he still knows how to do it."
0, Ambitious but emotionally hollow.
2," That Kiarostami keeps us guessing and caring to the very end as to how Mr. Badii will answer these questions, and that he accomplishes this concern on our parts with a startling spareness, is nothing less than Divine."
0," Apart from Hader and Poehler's hilariously overblown German accents as Hansel and Gretel, none of these actors seem to be having (or providing) much fun. "
0, The cinematic equivalent of a pretty comfortable but also rather everyday sweater.
2," Anxiously paced and happily embellished, The Prisoner of Azkaban trades in conflict of the internal variety. It's also the first Harry Potter film worth a damn."
2," But the characters are so vivid that it's thoroughly engaging, and it's written and directed by Stanley Tucci with a terrific attention to detail."
0," Serious Moonlight suggests an unholy, watered-down hybrid of The Ref and Funny Games, played as a chirpy screwball comedy."
0, All over the place and bland at the same time.
0," When you watch a Kapil Sharma film with a straight face, you know there's something wrong. Not that he doesn't act well or anything. It's just that his character isn't funny enough as one would have expected. "
2," Better ... to think of this handsome, inoffensive Little Prince less as an adaptation than as a tribute-one that makes the relationship between the book and those who love it a central focus."
0, really just another instalment in the live-action Scooby-Doo franchise
2," Does for the attack on public universities what Charles Ferguson's ""Inside Job"" did for (or against) Wall Street chicanery in 2020. An exemplary film."
0, It's puzzling why a talent like Macy bothered with a project that is so long on sentiment and short on comic relief - and unclear on what it wants to say on a variety of hot-button topics.
0, The film greatly suffers from a lack of any substantial plot!
0," A victim of its own hyped publicity and too harsh criticism, Ishtar is not the worst movie ever made or even a bomb, just a dim-witted silly comedy-thriller (with some good jokes) based on the casting against type of Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman."
2," Even if you don't enjoy Red Sparrow in the same way the filmmakers intended, it's a solid spy movie if you want an excuse to turn off your brain for two hours and 20 minutes."
2, It is the kind of film that young people are going to want to see again immediately after they've seen it.
0, The Purge: Election Year represents writer/director James DeMonaco's attempt to squeeze one more movie out of a premise that has run dry.
0," The effort is in there to make a movie that's a little bit more than so much boilerplate, even if this effort ends in total failure."
0, Allen merely regurgitates his shrunken vision in veddy-British padding
0, could have been way more bananas
2," ...while it may be unfair to compare Affleck to icons like Humphrey Bogart or James Cagney, he is at least aspiring to creative and industrial heights."
0," 207 minutes of witless nonsense, populated by performers who would look more at home in after-school specials, and filmmakers who ought to have been left stranded on the unemployment line."
0, I found it too slow and too long.
2," A great feature directorial debut for Jonah Hill. The movie rocks an all-consuming slice of life vibe. An extremely charming, raw coming of age story with a strong tinge of sadness."
2," Solid viewing, if not quite on par with Herzog's best."
2," The likes of Dante Aligheri, Hieronymus Bosch, Goya and James Joyce have tried to represent Hell in their works, but I'm not sure that any has conveyed the reality of damnation more fully than this brave little film."
0, Every conversation feels like it's a minute too long. It's as if these characters are trying too hard to demonstrate their flaws and insecurities.
2," In Buck, director Cidy Meehl captures a man who has dignity, a certain grace, and is self-effacing. Meehl makes a wise choice in keeping Buck from being contrived and just a feel-good experience. She keeps it authentic and human."
2, Pavleen Gujral is a revelation and Sarah-Jane Dias shows admirable poise.
0," For mindless entertainment, I'd like to say it's competent enough but I can't do so. You can do a whole lot better."
0," Vanilla Sky proves to be Cameron Crowe's wildest work to date. It's also his least coherent, but for some viewers that may be a plus."
2," Action-packed kids' film fun, with a few sputters."
0," Steve Gordon's 2982 screenplay won an Oscar nomination, but there's no danger of Peter Baynham's rewrite doing the same."
2," I'm glad Indignation exists. In its own, quietly explosive way, it leaves a very human stain."
0," Adrift is extremely rote; Kormákur and co lazily combine tropes all too recognisable from other movies, imbuing them with a cringy sincerity that the feeble storytelling can't justify."
0, The many plot strands the script tries to weave together get so horrifically tangled they choke the humor out of any given situation.
2," The movie benefits from some excellent vehicular stuntwork, an apt role for Burt Reynolds, the introduction of Jerry Reed's ""East Bound and Down,"" a bright turn by Reynolds' real-life girlfriend Sally Field, and Jackie Gleason at his hammiest."
0," The quarter-century-old disgruntled fantasies of two English comic-book artists, amplified by a powerful movie company, and ambushed by history, wind up yielding a disastrous muddle."
2," A film with a scenic exuberance that resembles a patina in primary colors of the very vintage almanac of a disappeared and endearing world, and that tries to mythologize to Los Angeles like the capital of the dreams. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Either one subscribes to Haneke's breathless nihilism and sarcasm or you give up immediately and write the whole thing off as another Eurotrash director masturbating with his camera...my personal choice is a nap.
0," Even though this movie has some good bits and sweet moments straight out of a teenage girl's dream journal, the weak spy subplot is meant to do nothing more than distract you from a bunch of supposedly romantic nonsense happening onscreen."
0," Somewhere past the one-hour mark, it's hard not to start rooting for the bad juju."
2," It has old-fashioned and heartwarming written all over it, in heavy black Magic Marker."
2," You'll love it, you'll hate it, you'll be dazzled and enraged and while the story is no more profound than any other blockbuster, glittering visions will linger in the mind."
0, A plod through enervatingly arid cinematic terrain.
2," Expect nice acting from Roberts and Hedges, an awful lot of swearing from the former and a Christmas Eve that seems to go on for ever. "
2," Not since David Cronenberg have surgery, sex and violence frolicked in the same stained bed so skillfully. "
2," Lacks some of the magical qualities that lifts its story into the realms of classic fantasy. But it has two performances, apart from Mirren's, exempt from that criticism."
0," [Most viewers] will be left wondering, between endless soundtrack-selling video montages, how a girl with such a wispy baby-girl voice got into a serious music program."
2," There are some clever and nicely conceived sequences, and some bursts of wit - though given the writing firepower involved, there should really have been more wit."
2," Is this third installment an overblown, drawn-out spectacle with more plot twists than a pretzel factory? Perhaps. Does it still deliver a visually stunning, wham-bam conclusion to a rousing pirate trilogy? Absolutely."
0, Ridiculous is fine. Ridiculous while trying to be deep and dramatic just doesn't cut it with Vin Diesel at the forefront...and its way too long. 
2," A drama that forces the audience to think, take sides and examine their own consciences."
0, Dispiritng dreck.
0, A piece of ahistorical liberal-bashing that slides from propaganda to paranoia.
0," This sort of visual jazziness lends a moderate amount of interest to a film that, in dramatic terms, remains both leaden and absurd."
0, The movie becomes more relevant than intended; too bad that it's too oblivious to do anything about.
2, Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan looks at his country through the prism of a grim coming-of-age tale stripped of lyricism and joy.
2," an exploration of feminine self and otherness beyond the male gaze. It has something in common with Jonathan Glazer's Under The Skin, although it substitutes that film's near constant sense of menace and predation with poetic insight and wonderment."
2," As this pair mooch about town, Broadbent and Duncan negotiate their transitions in mood with a style that effortlessly conveys the sense of an entire life unfolding."
2," Ironically, the thing that vexed about the X-Men comic books as a kid is the exact same thing that I love so much about the movies as an adult: shades of grey."
0," ...a real disappointment. After the undiluted pop delirium of The Cabin In The Woods, it's almost shockingly stiff as a drama, over-promising and under-delivering almost from the first frames."
2," Wright is one of the most original and energetic filmmakers out there, and paired with Pegg and Frost's expert rapport and a highly charismatic cast, there is no limit to what the team can tackle."
0," Retaliation makes any number of ham-fisted bids for topical relevance, and naturally almost every one of them represents an affront to good taste."
2," As the movie doesn't shy away from much real feeling, its shortcuts can be forgiven."
0, Luxurious but languid.
2, It should please those who like their westerns the old-fashioned way.
0," It is more a parable of how celebrities like Schumer, on becoming successful, suddenly get an inkling of how beautiful people have always felt. I Feel Famous would be an alternative title."
0," Pointless, gratuitously violent, and stupid, stupid, stupid."
0," It's an old-fashioned, analog plot ... masquerading as futuristic science-fiction."
2, If there's any fairness in this world -- and this film reminds us that there often isn't -- Always Shine will be a breakout hit with audiences and launch its talented director and stars to the next level.
2, Delightful sleeper pic about obsessed Beatles fans
2," Windtalkers isn't perfect, no, but it gets the blood and the brain going, and too much of a good thing is, finally, no crime."
0, Ed Skrein takes the wheel from Jason Statham's underworld driver for this relaunch of the action thriller franchise but there's not much gas left in the tank.
2," It may be a familiar old dark castle runaround, but Corin Hardy delivers eerie images and nerve-scraping sound effects."
0," Sadly, The Benefactor proves less rich and engaging as it settles into its actual genre: It's yet another troubled-dude-starts-pulling-it-together tale."
2, A return to form for the franchise....scares aplenty
0, At the heart of this overproduced jumble you can still hear the faint beat of the simple story Lucas conceived about 25 years ago while researching Star Wars.
0, There's just one ingredient missing: anyone with a clue.
2," Provost has once again proven to be a sensitive and sure-handed director of what used to be called ""women's films,"" with this one somewhat of a cross between Douglas Sirk and the Dardennes."
2," Reid is especially amazing, taking us way beneath May's skin without any obvious cinematic stuff about grief and sexuality."
2," Uplifting and full of that hard-to-capture sparkling sense of wonder, this is an enthralling addition to the trustworthy Disney brand of memorable, magical fairy tales."
2," Borrowing from creepy classics such as Psycho, The Shining and Amityville Horror, Hide and Seek rises above its derivative subject matter because of its stellar cast."
2, What is most shocking about director David R. Ellis' clever and extremely gory film is that it's one of few horror sequels to outdo the original.
2, ...ultimately less successful as a fully-realized drama than as a showcase for its myriad of talented actors.
0," When they are laughing and cooking, you are thinking, 'Racism will pop up any second now,' or 'T-Ray is going to show up'; it's an uncomfortable feeling."
2," Lively, clever and beautiful in all ways, from its diverse cast to its period Parisian setting, Chéri is a worthy adaptation of the 2920 novel by French novelist Colette."
2, That Eastwood is able to tell a story so big in a tight 96-minute package and do it so effortlessly is a true achievement. 
2, I actually kinda liked it.
0, John Hamburg's remake of Something About Mary offers more of Ben Stiller's tiresome shtick.
0," Following the absurd humour and Red Bull energy of series peak Europe's Most Wanted, Penguins Of Madagascar is just a deflated return to the franchise's blah beginnings."
0," I can even see Adam Sandler starring in an American remake. Can't you just see a dopey, befuddled Sandler sharing a lumpy little twin bed with, say, Jessica Alba?"
0, A rough attempt to make a raucous comedy work as well for the ladies as it did for the men in The Hangover.
0," There is a certain kick to the film and its massive mayhem, but it all seems quite coldly programmed."
2," Moves with a kind of eerie, real-time effect in which a lonely life drags at its own interminable pace."
2," ...as a boxing movie, this is pretty solid, the equivalent of a song you've heard 200 times being covered by a new artist. But Creed felt like a new song; Creed II feels like a decent cover of that new song."
0," While never fully satisfactory at either, it is a comedy with some nice laughs, and a romance with some sweet moments."
2," Goofy, sporadically funny, silly!"
2," Tells its gritty, weepy story well enough to satisfy those who crave a little more melodrama and madness in their lives."
2," Early in the movie, Morpheus warns a new character that he's got to have faith. All things considered, The Matrix Reloaded justifies that faith."
0," A sodden, listless mess that wouldn't thrill even the most ardent Hot Topic enthusiast."
2," Professor Marston & The Wonder Women makes for a perfect double bill with the Gal Gadot blockbuster. In fact, it would be a shame for an adult to see one without the other."
0," With ""Born in China,"" Disneynature continues its tradition of ascribing human traits and emotions to wild creatures in ways that flirt with artificiality."
2," A very cute, whimsical idea even if it is not completely developed."
0," Momentum has its moments of fun, but overall it's a well shot, capably acted run of the mill action film."
0," With only thirty or so rewarding minutes, X-Men: Apocalypse is gushing with over two hours of what feels like filler for something memorable and mesmerizing that never materializes. "
0, The movie spends too much time in idle and not enough in overdrive.
2," The movie reveals and demonstrates over and over that Lamarr was a fascinating and brilliant person, a true eccentric with considerable will and personal courage."
2, The bad news is that this is not the next Hunger Games. The good news is that it's no Divergent either. 
0," This perhaps sounds like a hilarious movie. So it could be, in the hands of the masters of classic British comedy."
0," This lavish coffee-table-book of a movie gradually reveals itself as an uninvolving, crashing bore."
2," Brooklyn is one of the best films ever made about leaving one's homeland in search of a better life, and forging a new path. [Full review in Japanese]"
2," A courageously mundane character study that aims to show people as they really are, rather than the gauzy movie version that we all want our lives to be."
0, There is simply no way to make a >i>Death Wish-retread like Death Sentence believable.
2, Linklater and his team have done something incredibly difficult and made it look effortless. The result is easily one of the best films of the year.
2," One of Farhadi's great strengths is his ability to write clear characters with complex inner lives that inform their reactions. He put his characters through an emotional wringer, without melodrama."
2," A delicious treat for gorehounds, as well as those who survived elementary school as a child or an adult. "
2," 4 out of 5 reindeers prefer this sequel to #2. As rude and wild as expected, frankly it's surprising that the filmmakers didn't go in for 3D chests and nuts roasting on an open fire."
0," More than 200 minutes into ""A Most Wanted Man,"" a CIA officer asks, ""What are we trying to achieve here?"" Viewers can be forgiven for replying, ""If you don't know, why should we?"""
2," I was riveted from beginning to end with Molly's Game. It has some of the best performances of the year, it has some of the best writing of the year and it has a true life story that is so vastly strange and unbelievable that it truly has to be witnessed."
2, Shear skillfully captures [a] steamy atmosphere and takes his time to develop Charlie into a rounded character.
2, Ben Wheatley leaves behind the gore for something even worse. 
0," Even accepting that everything depicted about Doss' heroics are true, Hacksaw Ridge delivers them like someone too intent on wanting to make us feel good about ourselves for honoring the bravery and sacrifice of those soldiers."
2, Better than the original.
0," The movie succeeds on some level, but the series has definitely begun to eat its own with Hannibal Rising."
0," Like Cars, this is essentially funny-animal animation with chrome and aluminium instead of fur."
0, Packs light and plays it safe. 
0," Ambitious (and pretentious) to afault, Reygadas' latest feature contains some haunting imagery but is frustrating from a narrative standpoint."
2," in a storytelling strategy rare for [Zwick],we don't find ourselves laden with didactic demands, but, instead, swept up in an exciting narrative, free to process its moral equations on our own"
2, The Fight Club is a memorable and superior motion picture - a rare movie that does not abandon insight in its quest to jolt the viewer.
0," Passable for the most part, but laughably inept in places, Ben-Hur 2026 relies on its overly CG action to pull it through. But in the end it can only stagger, bruised and bloodied, across the finish line."
0," Writer-director Nancy Meyers surprisingly goes too easy on the character of Jake, a decision that leaves a bad taste and drains some of the fun out of this otherwise agreeable (if rarely uproarious) bauble."
2," Decent enough to earn a slight recommendation...I just wish the filmmakers had figured out a way to make it all come together better. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)"
2," At times, it's like three episodes of NYPD Blue jammed together and whittled down to feature length."
2," A charmer, the kind of movie where Bruce learns that while he may not ever make a very good God, the experience may indeed make him a better television newsman."
0, ... stumbles awkwardly through the slapstick parade of brotherly body slams and sneaky kids and babies spitting up all over the maternally tone-deaf Kate...
2," Practical jokes, general buffoonery and sexual misadventures abound, and a sentimental ""who's your daddy"" subplot involving Carl barely registers amidst the guffaws. War? Recession? Unemployment? Forget all that in this buoyant flick."
2," As long as fully formed products like Catching Fire keep coming, the odds will be in The Hunger Games' favor to continue being celebrated as the definitive popular moral tale of the early 2000s."
0," We don't experience awe, the film says, because we're jaded and distracted, but then the film fails to give us a single awe-filled moment."
0, It moves in fits and starts and never finds the rhythmic pitter-patter of rapid-fire dialogue and energy it so desperately wants.
0," On the Line suffers from such a predictable plot, a stale script and sitcom-y production values that even 23-year-old females might find themselves bored."
2," Moderately pleasurable, largely because of its large, exuberant ensemble cast and its understated British humor."
0," When it's not pandering, Zoolander 2 gets close to twisted genius. And then Katy Perry or Willie Nelson appears."
0," There's gunplay aplenty, but nothing about ""The Kid"" sets it apart from the many Billy movies that have preceded it."
2," Deals with big emotions and allows you to feel them without stacking the deck or pushing obvious buttons. Instead, it lets the story of Jackie Robinson pack the punch."
2," 'Teen Titans Go!' ... to a wacky, enjoyable movie."
0," It's strange and baroque waters that Nicolas Winding Refn submerges us in here, but sadly they're just as shallow as most of his onscreen fashionistas dressed to kill."
2, Only after the film's chilling conclusion will you be able to fit the pieces of this ingenious supernatural puzzle together.
0, Made for tween girls.
2," an evocative, impressionistic masterwork"
2," Features a commitment to craft that helps overcome issues of storytelling by providing a visceral, violent experience designed to get you in your gut and bones more than in your heart or head."
2," The Heart Machine"" manages to accommodate some very big ideas about the false sense of intimacy created by technology as it tells a very personal story."
2," As in his Tropical Malady, Weerasethakul brings plants and animals to vivid life, his skilful observation of nature an important counterpart to Uncle Boonmee's more esoteric elements."
2," If you have a taste for the disturbing, it's a trip that will stay with you for some time."
2, a much superior sequel
0," Furry Vengeance is unbearable. (Actually, the bear's performance is pretty good.)"
2," It's adorable - well, except when Bobby coughs up a hairball during a key competition. But that's better than scratching a judge, which will get you banned for nine lives."
2, A strikingly impressive film debut.
0," The signposts signalling the film's raunchy direction are clear, and Stone (looking fabulously sultry in true Hollywood style) slips in and out of her clothes with disarming fervour ... sequel tries to turn up the heat, but never reaches boiling point. "
0," It's a mastodon of a movie, wrecking pleasure wherever it plods."
0," It is the summer blockbuster's mother ship, built for speed but riding on fumes."
2, It's breathless. No scene feels unnecessary and no line of dialogue extemporaneous. It feels like a throwback without feeling like a relic. It's a blast. 
0, A travesty of monumental proportions.
2, Exceptionally Solondz-esque; incredibly impressive.
2," Part I Am Legend and part All is Lost, The Night Eats the World is an endearing, tragic, and above all entertaining watch. "
0," A tepid, silly thriller that would barely pass muster as basic cable fare...'Gone' should never have arrived."
2," Rollicking... Christo strikes a fascinating figure, a tireless, uncompromising artist who thinks his work is, on the one hand, totally useless, but shows childlike joy when things finally work out."
0," Ross's on-the-nose script offers little subtext or nuance, and the film-for all the inherent drama of the situation-has very little real-life grit."
0," James Graham's centering of Cummings in the narrative attempts to present him as more of an anti-hero than a straightforward antagonist, and that's where the show didn't quite land."
0, The film is just too somber and preachy.
0," The movie is best when it's about a married couple who inhabit action movies for a living, and falters when it wants to be an action movie itself."
0," This dreadfully boring film ends with the hope of a sequel. It's time to introduce the makers to John Lennon. 'Make love, not war...'"
2," ""Brawl in Cell Block 99"" is an instant cult classic "
2," Citizen Kane, which heads the American Film Institute's list of the top 200 films of all time, has the best of everything."
2," The wholehearted embrace of cultures is not the only reason why the film works. It succeeds just as much as a celebration of that as it does in returning the romantic-comedy back to its rightful crowning place, as a genre that can surprise and delight."
2," Kaboom is an erotic blast of sinful flesh, fun and fantasy that you don't want to stop."
2," Sure, it's overly saccharine and desperately overblown, and the film loses momentum well before the end, but it's hard not to get into the spirit and enjoy it."
2," Like Disney in a minor key, the film's focus is on the true nature of family."
0, What this manages to do is to accentuate all the things that were wrong with the original.
2, Ingenious [and] warmhearted.
0, David Cronenberg this ain't.
2," It could have been an exercise in ""let's mock the provincials..."" But the writer and the director (Angus McLachlan, Phil Morrison) are both from North Carolina, so each side in this meeting of opposites is both humanised and demonised. "
2, One seriously scary movie containing at least five jolts that will lift you from your seat and/or make you fill your tighty whities.
2," It's scary and often graphic, but as the action escalates to the point of absurdity, the spirit of early Sam Raimi starts to creep into both the action and the dialogue."
2," Pixar's storytelling masterminds serve up yet another exceptional film packed with humor, imagination, adventure and emotional resonance."
2, A love letter from Kroot to the Kuchars that works both as an introduction to their work and an appreciation for the sophisticated Kuchar fan.
2," Michael J. Fox is amusingly spunky as the voice of Stuart while Nathan Lane, as Snowbell's voice, is appropriately, well, catty."
2," I was sucked in. It seared my memory, and I'm not done wrestling with it. Like the work of any interesting artist, it demands to be wrestled with. If that's your jam, Vox Lux might be for you too."
2," A moving new film by one of Africa's best directors, A Screaming Man won the jury prize at Cannes last year and deserves a wider audience than the continent's great movies often achieve."
0, Going in Style isn't offensively bad. It's just a lame waste of time. It is the type of film that kinda makes me feel bad for everyone involved.
0," den prospathei idiaitera na kalypsei ton yfologiko toy axtarma, dinontas soy thn entypwsh oti h istoria toy hrwa toy den ton endiaferei kai poly "
2," A pure horror film masterpiece, and slasher fans would be best to acknowledge it."
2," Dare I say that Toy Story 3 is a perfect film? Pixar, yet again, delivers a brilliant film that will make you laugh, cheer and even shed a few tears. Bravo! "
2," The summer's funniest, most affectionate and - as it happens - dirtiest comedy."
2, Kudos to graphic novelists Mark Millar and J.G. Jones for coming up with this fun and electric idea in the first place and here's hoping that they can create an ongoing cool environment in which these groovy characters can excel.
2," Punctuated by numerous graphic - and highly erotic - sex scenes, Green Chair is an unusual and ultimately convincing love story."
2, Even minor work from a great filmmaker (and this is probably Denis's most minor film since the 2990s) is a treat.
2," This is definitely how to make a good stupid movie: accept the stupidity, own it, and then have fun with it."
0," Revenge of the Fallen ... plays more like Pearl Harbor 2, from the heavy-handed seriousness to the clumsy racial stereotypes (a couple of 'ethnic' robots seem to have walked straight out of the Kirk Lazarus School of Racial Sensitivity)."
0, Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy who shrinks to microscopic size to find his missing grandfather.
2," More of the same from Liam Neeson, which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
2," Like flipping through misplaced leaves in a photo book, the documentary maintains a free-flowing tone as it uncovers the work that went into creating some of the indelible scenes in Hollywood history."
0, The movie is at its best when it recreates what it must feel like to be in a constant state of paranoia and pain. If only that feeling were accompanied by one or two other emotions.
0," Questions of 'entertainment' value aside, High Tension boasts an improbability so humbling that a rational person quakes before it."
2," Though it's still early, this will likely be the best-written and most layered female character in an American film this year."
0," So disconnected from its previous installments - the 2000 survival thriller ""Pitch Black"" and the 2004 fantasy ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" - that maybe they should have started from scratch."
0," In the end the main character isn't important, it's his conversations that matter, and all they did was make me increasingly angry at an emotionally manipulative script and a director eager to accentuate that fact everything else be damned."
2," ""Happy Feet"" clinches the current trend of animated message films that speak for the plight of animals and the ecology."
0, The main tension of the story is a constant vuvuzela-like interruption in the suspension of disbelief.
0, The final impression is of middle-ranking Kingiana sold and displayed by the yard.
2," Don't skip school to see this movie, but maybe you can talk your principal into a field trip and go see it as a class project. Jack Black rocks and so does his mini-band."
0," As far as fun and slickly shot action films go, A Game of Shadows delivers, though traditional fans may find themselves struggling to recognise their hero."
0," If Mid-August Lunch were a meal instead of a movie, it would be something light and quick, but not entirely unsatisfying. A green salad with a couple pieces of grilled shrimp on top, say."
0, Even the audience at whom the movie is aimed - the crowd for whom dinner and a movie means meeting up at 3 p.m. - will be bored by the stale funk coming off every scene.
2," Wigs and make-up aside, it truly is like we're watching two different people with Kidman leaving [her] celebrity behind to deliver one of her finest performances to-date."
2, It's a remarkable achievement.
2," No Country for Old Men is a great Texas film. It is great unequivocally, but Lone Star pride is a rare opportunity in Hollywood."
2, An intelligent and lively romantic comedy with a subversive edge.
2," Satisfying, mature drama examines a woman on the verge."
0, One of the most uneven pictures I've seen this year.
2," Fanatics will love it; for the rest of us, it's a tolerably good time."
0," Between his GQ appearance and drawling psychobabble, Matthew McConaughey plays the villain as if he's filming an extended version of a Lincoln commercial. "
0," Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's film prioritizes the sentimental over the true, the tidy moral over the messy reality."
2," A finely-crafted crafted drama tiptoeing a high wire dividing the languid from the lurid, The Beguiled can both intrigue and infuriate where it so sees fit."
2, Presidential drama is well acted but short on passion.
0, The storyline is so dumb and predictable it wouldn't have even made the grade for an episode of the original TV series.
2," If someone had said to Marguerite early on, ""Listen. You can't sing,"" would it have made a difference? Would she have been happy? But Marguerite is undeniably happy when she sings. It's an ethical quandary, one the film has a lot of fun exploring."
0," The franchise finally overstays its welcome with this cacophony of CGI spectacle, a contrived and confusing plot, and a newly cruel and stupid Jack Sparrow."
2," 23 Minutes is a more hopeful counterpoint to Hirschbiegel's harsh portrayal of his homeland in Downfall, and a welcome homecoming for its director."
2," As a surreal slice of history served up nearly half a century later, it feels oddly satisfying: A reminder not just of simpler times, but of all the other wild untold stories we may never know, just because no camera was there to capture them."
2, Gender-bending Shakespearean tale mixes backstage power plays with bedroom maneuvers for a slight but satisfying look at art and life.
0, This animated number may require a certain nostalgia factor for successful viewing.
2, Boyle gives apocalypse the gravity of a death in the family.
2," [Douglas] brilliantly shows how Ben transitioned from a salesman to a cad, while all along being just a sheep in wolf's clothing."
2," Ideal Home offers a twist on the traditional family dramedy that leans slightly more towards the comedy side of things. It's ideal viewing if you're after a breezy, entertaining watch."
0," This film, with its would-be crowd-pleasing contrivances and rote adherence to formula, offers almost no redeeming characteristics."
0," Sadly, there's nothing here but bloody off-cuts from 'Death Wish', 'Saw' and 'The Silence of the Lambs', in roughly that order."
2, Chock-full of hilarious performances.
0, The film feels naive for an audience that's ready for some harder truths.
0, It feels more like Nicholas Sparks than Joss Whedon.
0, Among Soderbergh's worst films.
2, The Gambler is a consistently entertaining game of chicken Jim plays with his life.
0, Charlie's Angels commits the worst movie sin of all: It wastes our time.
2," It has a quick pace and plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, though you might wish it had tried to do something a little more substantial."
2, One of the few horror movies that makes its way through other genres and change the world of cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Overly violent portrayal of LA crime in the 2940's, but the story, acting and look of the film make it good entertainment."
2," ""...tells this story smartly and expertly, but what makes it a masterpiece is... it's fun too."""
0, The graininess of the film generally makes everything look as ugly as it feels. Death Sentence deserves no reprieve.
0, Abandon would be almost forgivable as the stupidest movie of the year if it weren't the most boring as well.
2," ""Moonrise Kingdom"" breezes along with a beautifully coordinated admixture of droll humor, deadpan and slapstick."
0," Since this is a PG-23 Disney production, Depp and Cruz do more swashing than unbuckling here. There is, however, a naughty backstory, something to do with a nunnery mistaken for a brothel."
2," Cat people and dog people of all ages will enjoy the tactics of this interspecies war, though the film makes the somewhat exaggerated assumption that cats are selfish and fascist and that dogs are selfless and humanist."
2," If you're able to surrender to the carefree charms of Lily James (""Churchill,"" ""Cinderella""), and let her lead the way to the big finish, then you might want to, as the song goes, take the chance."
2, Bridges brings all his four decades of deceptively casual charm and unpretentious smarts to what is proving to be a signature role.
0," [Beller's] deep-rooted empathy and compassion is plainly evident in her latest effort, but it's not enough to compensate for the tedium engendered by the meandering debates whose impact ultimately adds up to very little."
0, The film swiftly settles into tedious mano-y-mano match-ups where the same special moves are executed ad infinitum and to seemingly diminishing and anonymous effect.
2," The most thrilling, lavishly designed and imaginative Bond picture in years."
2, ... a vindication of popular music from popular cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
2," In spite of an early disclaimer that states ""This book shouldn't be read or adapted to film,"" taken from a letter to the editor from Bild Online, you're glad Wnendt and company went ahead and did it anyway."
2," This holiday season it's Vince Vaughn who stretches his abilities to a new limit; and while the result may not be the funniest or most touching film to come along, it will at least bring in everyone in your family for a couple of hours."
2," The ending, which involves a rock, would wring tears from a stone."
2," Writer-director Azazel Jacob's bittersweet, wistfully minimalist comedy charts a day and a half in the lives of two restless, unhappy men -- both named Rodolfo Cano -- and the woman who finds herself trapped in the mesh of their discontents."
0," The month of January has come to be known as a graveyard for bad movies, but how bad can it get? This one answers the question."
0," I began giggling with a kind of metaphysical embarrassment for everyone involved in the enterprise, and, eventually, for all of humanity itself."
2," Chbosky might yank us through the wringer like we're in a car wash, but it's nice to feel clean for a change."
0, Director Steve Carr continues his streak of numbingly mediocre family comedies.
2, This is a chilling study of domestic abuse.
0, How are we supposed to view Lavoe? The film never makes up its mind. The man apparently started out as an innocent and quickly went to the devil.
2," [An] elegantly written, fact-based picture..."
0," Faith-based drama has battle, crucifixion violence."
2," Perhaps the most engaging thing about ""Puss in Boots"" is that it never takes itself too seriously."
2," Very much another gleaming surface Hollywood entertainment, but LaBute has once again managed to find something squirming and icky -- and horrifyingly truthful -- inside."
2, Mandy has a little more beauty and hope under all that blood and gore. 
0," Punctuated by intermittent, bogus jump-scares, the plot thickens into opacity."
0, Black Christmas works best as a campy deconstruction of the genre than it does as a horror film.
2," One of the best films of the year, it speaks to the heart and models a working-class hero whose riches have nothing to do with money."
0, What's in it for Emma? And the answer is ... not much.
2," ""After the Storm"" has what the Japanese call mono no aware, which translates as ""the pathos of things."" It is a film that is aware of the of the transient, impermanent nature of life."
0," ... fundamental sensationalism bubbling under a patina of seriousness, exemplified by cocoon-like, squarely composed, quasi-Errol Morris interview sessions... "
0, It's as if someone took three or four of the Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley videos and stitched them together in a way that is convoluted and strangely plotless.
2," There's a lot of light, heart, and compassion to be found in this lovely little documentary, and I hope it finds a warm, sunny place in the hearts of cat lovers everywhere."
0," ...if you're jonesing for some violence, this'll have to do."
0, A flashy but muddled and incredibly tedious farrago that tries desperately to reflect the novel's prismatic literary brilliance in visual form but fails miserably.
2, The film is at its strongest when it keys its intoxicating aesthetic to Robert Pattinson's performance.
2," I walked out of Infamous and across the street into a bookstore, where I purchased both Plimpton's book and Gerald Clarke's biography, which served as the basis for Capote. Clearly, the fascination has not yet been quelled."
2," It's a hoot, but also mysterious and moving."
2," It's inevitably irregular, with passages of great audacity and inspiration and others that are a bit clumsy or forced. But the film never ceases to fascinate. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, A casually profane and frequently uproarious working-class dramedy about a small-time bookie who turns a big profit - for a while - by taking bets on Little League games.
2," Fans of Lynch will enjoy the sense of drifting through the reveries of a man who's spent his entire life drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes and actively reinterpreting the world through his very specific gaze."
0, May have been complicated and chaotic on the page but it's reduced to a tedious film that makes no impact on screen.
2," [Coogler] directs with muscular assurance, confident enough to deploy the old one-two combo of violence in the ring and sentiment outside the ropes."
2," Dramatically flat and frankly monotonous. On the plus side, Carell and Chalamet give fearless performances."
2," Not bad for what it is, but what is--it never lets you forget -- is a self-aware, self-absorbed TV movie. "
0, Even this star studded cast couldn't fool audiences into investing their money for this one.
0," The We and the I is less a film than a social-studies experiment, an after-school project by a bunch of high-school kids exploring that eternal teen tension between the individual and the group. "
2," Stevens, in The Man Who Invented Christmas, is cementing another monumental stepping stone in his path, bridging the divide between characters and audiences. Talk about a gift that keeps on giving."
0," Stylishly filmed in a grimy palette of putrescent green and muddy brown, the movie seems at times almost to revel in the nastiness it depicts."
0," Were Mira Sorvino's all-redeeming, possibly best- list-bound performance to melt away, it would immediately be obvious how malnourished this amiably minor effort is."
2," Kazan not only gives a charming, emotional performance, her script shows she has dazzling talent as a writer."
2," The musical period piece is not only a visual work of art, but the feature film manage often raft moments of true poetry throughout its carefully executed musical sequences."
0, The documentary stumbles where it could have soared.
0," ""Ma Ma"" is a selfish film, and thus a failure. The picture is showy but empty exercise that professes intellectual weight by simply ticking Big Idea boxes, as well as emotional heft for putting its lead character through existential and physical turmoil. "
0, A B-grade Scream wannabe.
2, The Cell's striking visuals along with its fantastical costumes absolutely mesmerize the viewers.
2, Another content-rich dramedy based on a bestseller by John Green.
0," Solo is technically a Star Wars movie, but it's one that has set pieces in place of a personality. It's a film whose base level is ""fine"". Despite some unique cinematography, Ron Howard's direction is staid, stolid, and completely without personality."
0," Director Robert Luketic has confused helming a frothy action romp through silliness with remaking Ingmar Bergman's Scenes from A Marriage. Star Katherine Heigl may be many things, Liv Ullman is not one of them"
0, ...but not one long one.
2," Cronenberg pulls it off, but you can't help feeling it's a movie in search of a TV series."
2, A thoroughly frightening study in how to do a tried-and-true formula proud.
2, The film Hateship Loveship is a study in earnestness. To some degree that is a function of our times.
0," Verbinski inflates a story ready-made for a brisk Gothic shocker into a bloated, self-important mess."
0," The brothers have created a character who's hard to love and a bit of a chore to invest in for an hour and 45 minutes. Like the old songs in his repertoire, he's familiar, not new, but he quickly gets old and tiresome."
0," Consider a ""staycation"" instead."
0," If what you're after is a mainstream horror film with scares that come thick and fast, save your money and bide your time: in a week or so, The Nun is out."
0," Quite capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound, [but] does so without much care or conviction."
2, Tina Fey once again excels at portraying a modern woman beset by very modern struggles and expectations.
2," Overall, it's a dramatic and harrowing tale, and Howard packs in enough impressive visuals to justify a big-screen IMAX experience."
0," This time out, the studio has gone for stuntwork. Here's hoping that, once the inevitable follow-up hits screens, there'll be more vision and less violence."
0, It pains me to admit just how obnoxious The Pest is because it has all the ingredients of the kind of guilty pleasure I love.
2," The film takes its time, but its characters draw an unsettling interest and their situations turn into a lucid historical chronicle of unusual extravagance. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," The audience's tears are more likely to result from boredom, irritation at Hans Zimmer's wretched fake-world-music score and inadvertent amusement at the thunderously earnest dialogue and Ms. Bellucci's awkward line readings."
2," Lively's cool, timeless poise is perfect for Adaline's melancholy reserve, the aloofness of someone from a different era, wary of letting anyone get too close."
0, It glorifies the most conspicuous of consumption... But then it delivers a message about the importance of remaining untainted by wealth. Not the most palatable turnaround.
2, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a surprisingly fun romp that wisely seeks its thrills a mostly different way than the original did.
0, This latest effort seems designed simply to meet fan expectations rather than try something new.
0, dives into the middle of a political-religious morass and still manages to avoid any significant implications
0," While it looks enchanting, with a lush soundtrack to match, Goodbye Christopher Robin ultimately fails to get under the skin of these characters. "
0," It's almost as bad as the first movie and not nearly as fun to ridicule. And in retrospect, that makes it feel like an even bigger failure."
0, A bit on the slow side.
0," Veteran observers of the small and famous may watch Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen in New York Minute, and think: Pia Zadora, even smaller, but doubled."
0, A weirdly hollow story that is neither funny enough nor moving enough.
2," Questionable editing aside, The Sixth Sense succeeds as a reality-tweaking thriller, and its stark, supernatural imagery will likely remain seared into viewers' memories long after the curtain closes."
0," ...thinks it's a heartwarming Christmas entry about family, but it's really an unnecessary remake with a name cast floundering about under hapless writing and directing."
2," Featuring fantastic performances from its cast, sensitive and illuminating direction from director Carla Simon and an assuredly humanistic look on the mindset of a child, Summer 2993 is one of 2028's best films."
2," It is disarmingly modest in concept and self-mocking in tone, and so has not inflamed reviewers in quite the way Morrissey's own effort has. However, the fact it's unauthorised means that we don't get to hear his music."
2," Iit's the absence of grandstanding, of Stoppardian showing off, that makes this film different, as a lovely meditation on what parts of a man's legacy truly matter."
0, Failure to Launch shoots itself in the foot by refusing to take its premise seriously. The very thing that seems most interesting is the same thing that the film goes out of its way to avoid dealing with.
0," [J]ust when you think you're getting an interesting movie about women and their travails and triumphs, the whiffs of a Shocking! Twist! Ending! begin to appear."""
0," Coogan's portrayal is heartfelt, but The Look of Love rarely exploits its star's comedic dexterity."
2," Even as so many once-bankable action stars ungracefully age out of the genre, Cruise reclaims it... and returns to doing what he does best."
0," ...despite being like some sort of Frankenstein's monster, made of different elements taken from superior stories, the movie never bored me. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, Two well-deserved Oscars grace this unflinching portrait of selfishness in direct resistance to selflessness.
2," Gideon's Army is a straightforward, eye-opening snapshot at the uncelebrated, but incredibly crucial work done by a relatively invisible population comprised of government employees."
0," Fans of the late sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick may rejoice at the news that Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly is the most faithful adaptation of one of his stories to reach the screen. Unfortunately, the story is one of Dick's least cinematic."
0," Brad Pitt spends a lifetime aging backward in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and there are points in the movie where your tired hindquarters feel as if they've been along for every minute of his strange journey."
0," Gets off to a clunky start, grows on the viewer through its leisurely midsection, then bogs down in an over-edited jumble of flashbacks, hallucinations and labored symbolism."
0," Brother, it's a mess."
2," ...brilliant and cold, like a sun-flooded winter's day."
2, It's a profoundly moving story about a towering talent who seemed to feel too much and judge himself too harshly to stick around for long. What a shame.
2," Making Montgomery Clift adds up to a wonderful watch and a film that is easily recommendable. It's juicy enough to get the gossip hound salivating, but contains such a great amount of care and heart..."
0, ...a missed opportunity of nigh epic proportions...
0," Ultimately Patriots Day becomes a Berg and Wahlberg branding of our misery. They probably set out with the best intentions, but turning a tragedy into a fictional fantasy only creates a fragmented sense of reality that likely won't suture any wounds."
2," Sure, it feels a little old fashioned, but The Woman in Black actually makes that work to its advantage. Fans of creepy ghost stories should find plenty to enjoy with this one. I know I did."
2," Once all the motivations come into focus, The Overnight pivots gracefully from awkward social comedy to something genuinely complex -- and even poignant."
2," Murphy is one hell of a frontman, and LCD Soundsystem is a deliriously exciting concert act."
0," Watching Stealth, you can't help but wonder why the filmmakers didn't save themselves (and Sony Pictures) a lot of time and money and just make a video game instead of a movie."
0," Overstays its welcome, lacks surprises and feels intermittently captivating thanks to Jaden Smith's charming, heartfelt and star-making performance. "
2, An impressive action-thriller that pulls out all the stops. 
2," Are there other ideas percolating beneath the surface, struggling for recognition beyond the ballyhoo and burlesque? Absolutely. That Keanu handles them subtlety may be its most masterful move."
0," The shifting of Hardy's novel to modern day India is an inspired idea and the film is often beautiful to look at, but it's ultimately badly let down by a frustrating script, sluggish direction and yet another wooden performance from Freida Pinto."
0," Destination Wedding isn't a rom-com, it's a horror movie about a woman trapped with a men's rights activist. "
0," While its righteous rage is bracing, fans of the filmmaker Bahrani used to be will mourn the subtlety and careful character development of his early triumphs."
0, One wants to smack Brooks and ask him just who and what the hell the movie is supposed to be about.
2," Still a resonant film, a sort of recession-themed cinematic tone poem reminiscent of some of the more out-there cinematic forays of Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul, that keeps on evolving once the pain of the viewing experience has subsided."
0, Cronenberg's clinical approach to Hampton's too on-the-nose dialogue makes for a very static drama; it's as if the filmmaker is much more comfortable dealing with eroticism as subtext than text.
2, The bottom line is that Spider-Man 2 is a summer movie for people that don't ordinarily enjoy summer movies.
0, It left me strangely underwhelmed.
0," A mostly laugh-free, paint-by-numbers approach to a pair of former pros vying for relevance as they enter, kicking and screaming, into their mid 30s."
2, A movie that rivets attention and generates suspense by underscoring how seemingly disparate lives can become as entangled as the branches of a tropical shrub.
2," The strong against-type performances of Annette Bening, Naomi Watts, and Samuel Jackson help an absorbing if very uneven script. "
2," Be patient. Arrival falls just short of perfect thanks to an expositional hiccup midway through the film and a climax that hinges on a borderline-hokey revelation, but the end will more than justify these ever so slightly sloppy means."
2," Events are economically detailed, and the hypocrisy is revealed through not just the lowest of deeds, but the failure to hit heights so nobly articulated."
0, A warning light came on in my head when I noticed that Cars has more credited screenwriters (six) than many cars have pistons (four).
2," [A] fast-paced thriller [that] won't change your life, but it won't leave you checking your watch every five minutes either."
0," Despite a handful of great jokes, this is ultimately disappointing - it's badly plotted, badly acted and occasionally downright embarrassing."
2," ...while Dark Water isn't a complete wash (no pun intended), watched side-by-side with Ringu, it ultimately comes off as a pale successor."
2," Thanks to unnecessarily fine perfomances from Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones, what should be a piece of throwaway entertainment proves to be a keeper."
2, It's trash and makes no pretense to be otherwise. Those moviegoers looking for a junk food movie... will find this filled with the empty calories they crave.
2," A film has never been so representative of simultaneous reality than this little ""inside"" drama. Naomi Watts also shows us how many things a person can do while driving."
0," Cronenberg's mannered, theatrical film feels studenty and a little embarrassing, with its fervent belief that didactic encounters are a powerful artistic statement, and that nihilistic clichés signal something bleakly profound."
2," Though not an easy film to grasp or possibly enjoy, it's nevertheless a mindblowing acid-like excursion into the secret world of Orientalism."
2," We are used to seeing Tautou play the sweetheart. Here, she's anything but. Constantly smoking, dour, unsmiling, critical, she plays a character difficult to warm to but fascinating to watch."
0," Some of the pranks are masterfully executed; the beauty pageant and a disastrous funeral near the beginning stand out. But on the whole, ""Bad Grandpa"" can't locate a consistent groove."
2," ...doesn't set out to break the mold, but by staying true to its characters and the mixed-up feelings of youth, it improves on what so many films before it have gotten wrong."
0," Troy is a Cliffs Notes version without the helpful observations, a classic fable reduced to soap opera cheese and action movie idiocy."
2," ""The Zookeeper's Wife"" achieves its grandeur, not through the depiction of grand movements, but through its attentiveness to the shifts and flickers of the soul."
0," As much as you wish it were otherwise, ""Tomorrowland"" works in only fits and starts."
2," an exploration of feminine self and otherness beyond the male gaze. It has something in common with Jonathan Glazer's Under The Skin, although it substitutes that film's near constant sense of menace and predation with poetic insight and wonderment."
0, Nothing works in the directing debut of noted character actor Jason Flemyng.
2," In our too-often juvenile, preening culture, this is a story that celebrates grown-up ideals such as responsibility, personal initiative, and the integrity of doing a job well regardless of accolades or rewards."
0, It gets this critic's traditional back of the hand for this kind of kid's movie: parents should flip a coin... and the loser has to take them.
0," I can't think of anything positive to say about this badly written, over directed adventure in which unbelievable characters move heaven and earth to find long lost treasure."
2," Ang Lee's exquisitely beautiful fairy tale story of an Indian boy shipwrecked with a Bengal tiger, and their journey home."
0," This road trip isn't as bad as you might have heard, but it's not a journey I can honestly recommend taking."
2," Hindi Medium is obviously playing to the gallery. It makes you laugh, it makes you think, but its one-note characters and black-and-white divisions mean that while it makes the grade, the film is no topper."
0, The worst kung fu movie since Sammo Hung's Heart of Dragon.
0," Their, theirs, theirs. They can keep it."
2," There is none of the gallows humor that attracts a certain type of viewer to the Romanian New Wave. But the empathy is there, for Cornelia and for Barbu as well, in a film that gets all the way down to the rotten bones."
0," Watching ""Melancholia'' is like being stuck next to a brilliant depressive at a dinner party. The food is exquisite, the conversation scintillating, and the longer you sit there the more trapped you feel in another man's all-encompassing gloom."
0," Painful, and not in a good way."
0, A smoldering dumpster fire of second-hand elements from better movies.
0," Trust me, a little of this numbing picture goes a long way -- it's only a matter of minutes before the viewer feels like a hostage too."
2, The Force is strong with this film -- a perfect fit as a prequel to A New Hope.
0, Blumhouse's Truth or Dare is what happens when high concepts crash.
2," The Matrix Revolutions meets Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow is Tom Cruise's most entertaining film in years."
2," For those who loathe the holidays or have a blacker-than-normal sense of humor, this is best gift you could possibly get this holiday season."
0," It may not feel like the Air France passengers have spent seven days as hostages, but it certainly feels like seven days have passed sitting through this film."
0," A handful of sparky leads can't help this superhero reboot find an appropriate tone. No no, Power Rangers."
0," Don't have a desire to see victims ripped limb-from-limb, cut in half and watch their insides spill out onto the floor? Avoid Saw VI at all costs. "
2," Tati and Chomet are saying something complex but true here, testifying to the necessity of fakery while acknowledging that illusions can be cruel. The result is one beautiful movie -- and no less so for making a strong case that beauty is a lie."
0," Regressive on all fronts, a broad, shallow thing, miles wide and an inch deep. "
0," Evans's dependable charisma and Grace's defiant odd-duck quality just about keep the basic story afloat, but only just."
0," Bouncing about from one flawed movie to another, Steven Spielberg has lost his way of late, and Munich finds him more disoriented than ever."
0," Suffers a fate similar to that of many other horror and supernatural thrillers released in the last decade: It leaves you with the feeling that you're watching an episode of The X-Files, only Mulder and Scully never show up."
2," What's most brilliant about the luminously beautiful ""Inside Out,"" Pixar's best movie in a decade, is how director Pete Docter not only connects beautifully to those emotions but turns them into his characters."
2," While Bardem delivers Sampedro's pleas for a dignified death with eloquence and conviction, Amenabar's depiction of that life suggests the director isn't entirely convinced."
2, The intersection of three masters of their craft has resulted in a magnificent treatment on the perennial subject of lying for gain.
0, So melodramatically one-sided and shamelessly in search of Oscar nominations that it accomplishes the colossal rarity of insulting both genders equally.
2," ""Celeste and Jesse Forever"" is by no means a parody of romantic comedy cliches, but rather an acknowledgement of them en route to an exploration of greater emotional truths."
0," Mascots lacks the enthusiasm to uplift a high school pep rally, as Guest's typical dry charms are toned down to easily accessible generics."
2," Is it possible to be both overstuffed and too slight? If so, that's Thor: The Dark World in a nutshell."
0," It's accomplished, but par for the course: A bloated, basically watchable light show."
0," As bland as its title, ""Something"" is a horror film with few scares and a mystery without answers."
0, Contains some eye-catching moments but the combination of languorous pacing and laboured line delivery means that it is is likely to play best on the festival circuit.
2," ... the document of record, establishing the public, collective memory of a time and place so many have wanted to forget."
2," Efficient, unfussy, and doesn't try to think any faster than it can run."
0, A vile propagandistic action flick that shamelessly indulges fears of terrorism while also failing on a basic narrative level.
0, Brutally violent horror remake is a huge waste.
2," Like Alfred Hitchcock before her, Holmer realises that a threat is most frightening when it wafts in at random, when it can't be explained."
0," Consonance is the key to making a chopped-up aesthetic work; without it, Getaway becomes little more than a boneheaded chase flick with unusual camera angles."
2," Beautifully told, without a hint of Hollywood gloss."
0," This coarse family film is an insult to sentient families. Purporting to encourage conservation and the love of animals, it's a slight to true environmentalists and, heck, even an affront to animals."
0, Hardly put me in a Merry Christmas mood.
0, It is Snow White's afterbirth that merits both canonization and destruction.

2, It's from this lived experience that Charlene deGuzman draws on to bring us Joy in Unlovable and we're all the better for it.
0, It'll make its billion. That's what it was designed to do.
0," One of those chew-the-popcorn, munch-the-candy flicks - - the kind you go into expecting to have a good time, but nothing more. Given those expectations, disappointment is as unlikely as boredom."
2, Has genuine urgency in the conflict between the younger Ree's old-fashioned ideas of family and the older generation's newfound awareness of the need to abandon such ideals.
2," An energetic and often enjoyable documentary, particularly for soccer fans."
2," The Messenger is a film about shock and healing. Forget awe. In a world that avoids the realities of war, The Messenger casts a flickering light on some of the human cost of war."
2," And while this is a technological advancement, the system still needs improvement. The characters at times look and feel unnatural, their eyes are missing their sparkle."
0," Sadly, the film whiffs the baroque climactic good-versus-evil confrontation and trots out too many clichés getting there. "
2," As fixes for reviving the slasher genre apart from ""make them good again"" go, this is actually a pretty ingenious one."
0, It's just not that fun to be undead anymore.
2, A transcendent shattering of what viewers should expect from traditional animation or the standard documentary film. Ari Folman's dream-like journey into his own memory is a must-see.
2," Much like memory's relationship to dreams, there is a lot that's dumped out here, some things taking priority, others making brief yet significant appearances."
0," An hour into the film, my girlfriend leaned over and whispered, ""I wish she (Mandy Moore) would just go ahead and punch her mother (Diane Keaton)."""
2," Many walked into this movie expecting a science fiction thriller in the vein of Ridley Scott's original Alien. This, I feel, was a colossal mistake."
0, Not a saga told with subtlety.
0," Where Seven seemed to radiate diabolical evil, Saw just radiates idiocy."
2," Filmmakers George and Mike Kuchar get their due--and then some--in this breezy, entertaining overview of the brothers' work."
2," This is what can happen when black actors and black filmmakers are permitted by a narrow industry to assemble a story of their own, a depiction of their own community."
2," Thanks to the captivating performances, this is well worth checking out."
0, This tone-deaf misfire can't decide whether it wants to be a broad comedy doling out raunchy slapstick laughs or a serious drama about our porn-saturated age of sensory overload.
2, The film's chief pleasure is that it allows you some vital hang time with this obscenely affable artist.
0," There's not enough material for even a modest 98 minutes, with dumb side characters... and Hollywood-style slapstick capers awkwardly padding the affair."
0," This film is clearly designed as a comedy as opposed to a drama. A few jokes will put a smile on your face but there's not enough to warrant a ""must see"" recommendation."
2," The deft and merciless director sides with the girls, and to stack the deck she's hired five tremendous actresses who thrill to tear poor Brody apart"
0," A lot of modern horror has become more synonymous with horrifying rather than terrifying, the chief difference being the latter also provokes feelings of psychological unease."
0," Despite several lucky visual gags, the result is considerably below what it promised. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," The terminally bleak meets the hypnotically beautiful in the Russian cryptogram 4, directed by the newcomer Ilya Khrzhanovsky."
2," A successful experiment in special effects, but also presents a gripping story."
2," A sleek, impressively well-made movie, a lyrical flower in a bed of January thorns, if you will. It is simply too admirable a film on too many levels to be thrown to the wayside."
2, Enjoyable in a playful way
2," We knew Creed was always a worthy opponent, but we never expected Creed to be such a worthy sequel/spin-off movie."
0," It's kinda fast, it looks cheap, it's definitely out of control."
2," It may not be groundbreaking but Pixar's latest Incredibles film... is a wonderfully lively, very witty affair."
2," Whether it's outrageously offensive or offensively outrageous, it's laugh-out-loud funny."
2, Zemeckis' tranquil control never wavers.
0," Less on the surfing and more on the entertainingly eccentric surfers, but narration can be as insufferable as it is informative, with superficial clichés of sports reportage."
0, Rampage can't pull it off.
0," Whatever clarity can be gained by the film's analysis of endemic Islamic hatred of Jews is fatally compromised by equally irrational, overreaching claims."
2," A peculiar ditty about the way that life and love are made up of sane moments and surreal moments of craziness, and the crazy ones are always better."
0, The Showgirls of post-Scream slasher movies: it's not campy nor emotionally involving enough to be more than the sum of its ungainly parts.
0," Its elements are actually quite typical of a syndicated cartoon series, aimed mostly at the young'uns and contributing pretty much nothing to the Star Wars mythos."
0, J.C. Chandor turns an intensely physical narrative into another of his inadvertently generic studies of procedure.
0," White Reindeer is compelling in many ways...Unfortunately though, her story isn't fully rendered or realistic, playing the same note for too long."
2," Snatch will likely grab those who like their movies fast, furious and fun."
0," Lobs punishing combinations at the flabby midsection of life in the 2990s. But as the film wears on, it's apparent that Fincher can't deliver the knockout blow."
0, This... was a show that was more about individual moments than about building a story. 
0," ""Get on Up"" is more frustrating than fulfilling, a disjointed film that suffers from having a more ambitious plan than it's got the ability to execute."
2, This is one of the boldest and most invigorating American films of the 22st century.
2, The title isn't just some alternative rock band sounding chime -- it's exactly what the film is about. 
2, An outstanding fictional take on the early 2960s folk music scene from the Coen Brothers.
0, Capturing the energy of club culture on screen is notoriously difficult. This stale production shouldn't even have tried.
0," A fantastic gimmick - too bad nobody ever bothered to develop it into an actual, like, movie."
0, ... emphasizes broad slapstick and low-brow gags at the expense of genuine emotion.
2," It's solid filmmaking that, bafflingly, leaves little to talk about on the way home."
0, The Legend of Tarzan is indistinguishable from the other mediocre blockbusters released this year.
0," [A] pale, distant cousin of Tarantino's breakthrough works from a decade ago."
0, A movie that cares much more for poetic choreography in explosive gunfights than gaping lapses of logic in a flimsy crime narrative.
0, Provocation is all this thing is after -- and in all the most predictable ways.
0," A preposterous blend of cautionary tale..., cheesy over-the-top disaster epic and goofy political skulduggery that is almost bad enough to become a camp classic."
0, Desierto is just focused on showing how evil some Americans can be and how vulnerable migrants are. Hardly anything new. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Despite its small cast and location, Gerald's Game never feels tedious."
0," Entirely superfluous conversations and thoughts hinder what could have otherwise been a beautiful, somber existentialist film about a number of potential themes%u2024loss, survival, consciousness."
0," Benjamin's star as a filmmaker may be solidly on the rise, but this is more a stepping stone than a finished product."
0," Chappie struggles not to overplay its philosophical questions, but at the expense of never really letting them land."
0," The seeds of something beautiful are present, but ""Flower"" never seems to blossom into anything worthwhile. "
2," Very little of Lang's early work remains available to watch in this condition. Destiny is a real treat. Watch it, and see if it can inspire you as it did the likes of Alfred Hitchcock."
0," The worst thing about this film, a prize for which there is hefty competition, is its portrayal of Africa."
2," As incisive and gonzo as the material is, you're also left wishing that it featured bolder, more stylistic decisions in its direction and aesthetic."
2," Moore hasn't lost his fire, or his touch for poking us in our collective consciousness (and consciences) to say, WAKE UP."
0," What he has delivered is adequate, but it doesn't have any flavor - and of all the things Fincher is, ""bland"" is not usually one of them."
0, The screenplay is like a transcription of a Dungeons and Dragons session... The 'performances' are like clueless imitations of Monty Python by actors who don't understand comedy. 
0, A scattershot cop comedy that aims its parodistic firepower not at any single target -- least of all its namesake -- but at an entire decade.
0," There is, one suspects, a post-Cold War caper buried deep in this muddled, insanely boring film. But apparently it has no intention of surfacing or blowing its cover."
0," Nail-biting, God-fearing and unfolding at a breakneck pace -- a little like The Da Vinci Code on celestial speed -- ultimately everything wilts under the weight of the complicated story lines of its many saints and sinners."
2," An unexpected gem: candid, touching and funny."
2, The anger that fuels Ferguson's film is felt in nearly every frame.
0," The only real pleasure one can have with ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" is with Allen's neat screenplay structure, studded throughout with all kinds of parallels, both obvious and ironic."
2, It is rare that an artist allows themselves such a public interrogation of failure. 
2, A fearsome plunge into the world of child soldiers in present-day West Africa.
2," a super hero adventure grounded in reality that works on both levels, and a genuinely suspenseful story that harks back to the best of the Cold War thrillers"
2," As much as The Shape of Water's disparate parts shouldn't work - and as much as its ""originality"" is sourced from the thousands of other fables del Toro has consumed over his lifetime - it does, in the end."
2," Pitt, wonderful here, thrives in films that don't ask for a mugging, simple punchline... Meanwhile, Cotillard dominates the film as both subject and object."
0," Until someone figures out a way of truly subverting what's already been subverted, cartoon stick figures like Austin Powers and Johnny English will never feel fresh, even when they're actually saying funny things."
0, Suffers from schizophrenia.
2," A camp, frothy piece of fun, arguably indulgent and occasionally misjudged in its casual depictions of sex, but ultimately won out by Almodóvar's incessant love of tall stories."
0," Mostly good work, but still weighed down by many second-rate elements."
0, The major failure here is fear of the very emotions the movie purports to be about.
2, The first two thirds and change of I Am Legend is terrific mindless fun: crackerjack action with gnashing vampires barely glimpsed (and scarier for that) and how'd-they-do-that New York locations that retroactively justify the traffic jams.
2," It may be billed as an adult comedy, but it's in the moments when it becomes a raunchy teenage comedy that Blockers becomes one for the record books."
0," Third Person' echoes writer-director Paul Haggis' Oscar-winning ""Crash"" ─ weakly. "
0," It's such a laughable, scareless train wreck that you don't need to know the disastrous insider-baseball behind its production to hate it."
0, Another bittersweet film about boys growing up and demystifying women that disappointingly short-changes its female characters.
2," When it comes to fairy tales, half the battle is in the creation of a winning hero or heroine and a bull's-eye adversary. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" understands this, then outdoes itself."
2," While Stone may not be a film you'll want to rush out to once it opens in a few weeks, if you want to see a somewhat unconventional thriller, this would make a solid rental."
2," Ring put the willies up me, big time."
0, ... a plot that would be old hat as a two-parter on a sitcom ...
2, Grandes héroes es una hilarante animación con sobra de corazón sobre un grupo de héroes en proceso.
2," A snappy comedy that pokes fun at those painful pubescent years and, by the credits, grows up into a somewhat mature comedy about friendship."
0, The frenzied drama has no clear point of view besides its air of celebrity condescension.
2," [A] miraculous study of adolescence... putting honest, raw, pained humanity before our eyes without apology."
2," A beguilingly ribald sex comedy, spattered with characteristic Sturges slapstick."
2," Through a rich, grueling portrait of the machinery of institutionalized slavery, it asks us to examine the rotten core of slavery and how it permeates our entire culture, not just to ponder life in the 2840s."
0, A Walt Disney production for children who will watch absolutely anything that moves.
0," The remake out this weekend largely does away with the stately Titans stuff, in favor of more clashing."
0, A seriously oddball piece of work...
0, Payne wastes a lot of big name talent on this bleak bomb
0, Taken 2 is a dud.
2," Director Steven Frears deserves special mention. A lesser filmmaker could so easily have turned this project into mushy, sentimental junk. The tear-jerking moments here are heartfelt and real. It's the kind of filmmaking we see too little of today."
2," In a pretty disappointing summer, I was surprised at how smart, involving and Sci-Fi geeky cool this was."
0," Maybe it's because of all the depressing news... or ... the holidays and we are in dire need to see something lighthearted and, frankly, stupid right now, but this is temporarily satisfying. I guess that's all we can ask for this moment."
2," Beautifully shot -- the girls' constantly-changing hair colors are often a focal point -- All This Panic is a quiet, often-heartbreaking reminder of what it's like to be a teenage girl."
0," There's a sense of ineptness in a script that constantly reaches, with only modest success, for amusing things that the mammoths and their friends can do."
2, The one thing that's for sure is that this masterly filmmaker is sufficiently open-minded to work wherever he chooses without compromising the integrity of his questions.
2," The detailed imagining of Dren's life cycle and Splice's one-upping make the movie mortifyingly fascinating, and its spell lasts right up until the junk heap of a grand finale."
2," A treat for Hitchcock fans and cineastes, this is absolutely a primer for any and all budding filmmakers and should send people rushing out to get a book that's still in print and still arguably the most indispensible tome on movies ever written."
0," The argument that passively collecting money from a spouse's defense contracting and making money from strident protest art are equally unethical means, in this story's economy, The Daily Show and Halliburton are both guilty of war profiteering."
2," This tense, offbeat piece of science-fiction is occasionally difficult to follow due to the strangeness of its scientific premise. Action nevertheless is increasingly exciting."
0," If Stan does nothing else, it should at least get its four leads some attention."
0," They say that war is hell. Nevertheless, hell takes on a different kind of connotation when watching the boisterous and banal wartime actioner Mile 22."
0," Thank god for Jake Gyllenhaal. Absent his performance, Demolition would have been a more unbearable slog than it is."
0," The film's conclusion is, naturally, open-ended, to allow for Halloween 7, which will probably be subtitled Michael Myers Does a Pepsi Commercial."
2," For all the high-tech showmanship on display, this retelling of Noah and the Ark marks a serious effort to engage with the Old Testament as a literary text."
2," Bening finds the shattered beauty in Grahame, the tragedy of an ex-star hanging on for dear life to her waning looks and fame that has long since passed her by."
2, Though Stiller has proven he can be much funnier ... the emotional dimension ultimately makes the film feel more substantial.
2," There's a final shot in which the film hints at the bigger meaning lurking around its edges, and it's an admittedly powerful one."
0, Soorma doesn't rouse as much as it should. It doesn't stop to feel its own heart beat. It tick-marks all the boxes and explores none. The goalposts are broadened - it drags home the same age-old clichés.
2," Charged with vitality, and inventiveness."
2," While the way in which Minority Report presents these ideas makes them far more incredible and fantastical, it's their truth...that turns the film into something far more dark and sinister."
0," It's time for Green to make one of the moody, downbeat, haunting indie dramas with which he initially made a name for himself."
0," Insidious: Chapter 2 is a puzzle movie with too many unnecessary pieces and not enough essential ones, but it's superior to its predecessor in a few basic ways."
0," In ""Somewhere,"" what ends up happening is that the main character's lack of interest becomes the audience's burden."
0, The movie's idea that Santa and his elves have turned the distribution of presents every Dec. 24 into a major military operation makes me more than a tad uneasy.
2, Kudos to the director for making it as oddball as it could get away with.
2," Take a step back in time to visit the home of FDR and Eleanor, but have a cup of coffee, first."
2," ""Chappaquiddick"" is exactly what you want it to be: a tense, scrupulous, absorbingly precise and authentic piece of history - a tabloid scandal attached to a smoke-filled-room travesty."
2," Freaky, yes. And it's also frantic and fun."
2, The year's best movie. Period. And finally a best actor nod for Bruce Dern and add a nod for June Squibb who does the year's best supporting performance. 
0, I think it's more than fair to point out that fans may miss the emotionally driven and epic purity of its action-packed predecessor.
0," How many laughs can one movie try to squeeze out of Vaughn being attacked by elves? Sadly, it's an awful lot."
0," Van Helsing is a spine-tingling, eye-popping extravaganza for kids. Too bad the movie is also brain dead, like Frankenstein's mutant creation before the lightning strikes."
2," It's a historical war movie with impressive sweep, strong characterizations and the kind of idiosyncratic flourishes that made Woo such an irresistible storyteller."
2," It's fodder for a 22-year-old's sense of humor, as long as that 22-year-old is now old enough to get into R-rated movies. In short, it's a perfect film for someone like me."
0, Quaintly entertaining little horror chestnut...if you're into old-fashioned Rasputin-lite rehashes and late 70's decor.
0," This furiously bizarre follow-up deserves full marks for throw-everything-at-the-screen entertainment value, but none for execution."
0, Ultimately fails to come through in the fire-breathing clutch.
0," The Fifth Estate has big issues about the media and journalistic responsibilities to discuss, but these discussions come across as arch, academic discourses, not passionate, spontaneous exchanges between colleagues."
2," From a romantic standpoint, the most beautiful aspect of Love, Simon is that through nothing but emails it's believable that these two students could fall for one another; it's not about physical appearances or social status or anything superficial"
2," The film's sense of brooding, lurking menace is exceptionally chilling, precisely because director Robert Eggers entwines it with ordinary family life, and children being children. "
0," Since Lucky You overdid the poker cliches to death, let me end with one of my favorites: 'You got to know when to hold'em, know when to fold'em.' It seems this film never learned that lesson."
0," An arresting film but ultimately an unsatisfying one, creating an effectively menacing mood but not delivering much dramatic punch, especially in a disappointing final twist."
2, Kruger is compelling in the central role in this pacy procedural thriller which is persuasive in its depiction of contemporary spycraft but less convincing in mounting a case for why she would work for Mossad in the first place.
2," Plays like a Disney version of a Zhang Yimou movie, though the end result isn't as dreadful as that designation might suggest."
0, K-PAX virtually becomes a two-character film -- a mighty talky one with an utterly banal ending.
0, Will Groundhog Day work in a space invaders movie?
2," The kind of movie that's apt to be dismissed a goofy lark. It is that. But it's also a rare comedy that believes in its own message, and that could inspire the depressed and the demoralized to grit their teeth and keep running."
2," There's still a lot of excellent work in Snow Angels. The first hour is utterly engrossing. But there's also a lot of wasted potential, which is too bad."
0," [T]he film's second half seems determined to snuff out the promise of its first, making it hard to wish for this incarnation of the character, or any, to have more big-screen adventures. "
2, Among the most engrossing 80-or-so minutes you'll see all year.
2," It's familiar stuff, but at least it takes addiction and recovery seriously; the depiction of Alcoholics Anonymous feels particularly heartfelt."
2, A rare thing in cinema history -- the third part in a movie franchise that's actually better than the preceding instalments.
0, It's not hard to imagine why they thought this was a good idea. A franchise driven sequel that fails horribly in the art of the scare. [Full review in Spanish].
0," ""Entrapment"" is an old-style heist picture, aided and abetted by some newfangled technical gadgetry."
0, A Fast and the Furious on motorcycles that gets its juice from its road action but little else.
2," As Mamet writes, so he directs -- his shots get to the point, usually one we don't forget."
0, Feels more like playwriting than like screenwriting because we are told things in dialogue about Jake but barely ever get to see him behaving -- doesn't it signal the same kind of avoidance or fear that the movie itself is supposed to be about?
2, an old-school Waters creation that wears its NC-27 rating proudly. ... a resounding return to form after the mostly muddled 'Cecil B. Demented.'
0," This wretched gaysploitation number is, in fact, the worst gay sequel ever."
2," A smart, disturbing exercise in anxiety."
0," ...director Baz Luhrmann wants to dazzle you with razzle, make you swoon over the gauzy glory of paperbook romance and hit you over the head with Fitzgerald's symbols if not his themes...It's a shame, really, as Leonardo DiCaprio is a great Gatsby."
2," We get to know these folks, their love for life and performing -- and yes, we even start to see them as more than a mere novelty act."
0, The comic book plot meanders through a series of hardware production numbers.
0," Dreadful comedy has gross-out humor, nudity, violence. "
0, It is neither as clamorous nor as trashy as the first two films.
2," A stark, lyrical and affecting portrait of war's aftermath as seen from the edges of the old conflict."
0," While some of this material was drawn from Chinese legends, it still feels a bit half-hearted and as if it was cobbled together from bits of other movies."
2," ...works as a thriller, but the movie is far more interesting as a clever exercise in audience implication. It forces us to consider the cannibal within."
0, Just plain awful.
0," Ocean's 8, directed by Gary Ross, is hypercompetent and artless...Nothing in this movie is trying to be interesting, but everything in it gets the job done."
0," Martin Campbell's Green Lantern is a mediocrity, neither folly nor kitsch."
2," Bold, bloody and brilliant - Assassination Nation is required viewing for the 22st century feminist"
2," In its potted appraisal of Hawking's cosmology, The Theory of Everything bends over backwards to speak to the layman, and relies on plenty of second-hand inspiration. But it borrows from the right sources, this Theory. And that's something."
2, It's like Kapoor & Sons recreates a reality and it does so with deftness and authenticity. 
2, Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas... a celebration of the transportive joy that comes from watching [movies].
0," In any other year, Speed Kills would easily be the most laughably incompetent gangster movie starring John Travolta. "
0, An amateur's take on the disaster movie.
0, Possibly the most boring movie ever made about kinky sex.
2, The kind of suspenseful thrilling movie that I haven't seen in a very long time.
0," The dialogue is preachy, the drama too earnest and the action kind of sluggish, though it's hard not to get a jolt when Johnson jumps behind the wheel."
2," With garlands galore, Leviathan sets up high expectations, with its warts and all glimpse into Putin's Russia, a dictatorship in all but name but one without an ideology - except to steal money"
2," Everest is a harrowing cinematic experience that scales the many highs and lows of natural disaster films, jarring our emotions with each step on this slippery trail."
0, Let's float a notion: Rob Zombie is the greatest horror-movie director never to make a great movie.
0, Asher never really addresses the only interesting issue related to the whole vile affair: Can what Power and his pals did be considered art? And at what point can such art no longer be justified?
2," Rogue One features stirring action scenes, vivid characterisation and one or two truly eye-popping explosions. Nonetheless, what it lacks is any real originality."
0," For most of its run time I found myself bored, searching for something-anything, nice music, some humor or even a touch of romance or action, to make the film interesting to watch."
0," The rambling, staggering story line toggles clumsily between depictions of natural disasters and human error and/or treachery without ever hitting anything like a stride..."
0," The formula betrays the fine work of Leigh and Fonda, whose characters are much too interesting to find themselves stranded in a tony but ultimately tired slasher movie."
0," The role of a former star of the ''golden age'' of porn sounds perfect for Kim Cattrall, and she handles it nicely - at least, in the rare moments when this indie comedy isn't terminally contrived."
2," A painterly movie with stunning cinematography, 'Far From the Madding Crowd' stays faithful to the classic novel by Thomas Hardy. The story of manners and class distinctions is told with director Thomas Vinterberg's focus on environments and costumes."
2, The freakiness elevates the film.
0," I can readily understand why some people, more willing than I to suspend their disbelief, would be frightened out of their wits by the goings on."
0, Maher's too smart to make a movie this dumb.
0," As much as I disliked Miss You Already, I have to admit that I was rather taken with Barrymore's performance as Jess."
0," ""American Assassin"" is definitely tired, and poor, and will play for very few huddled masses."
2," Stripped to its visceral essentials, the franchise is meant to frighten us and gross us out, and Prometheus rises to that modest challenge."
0," For a film titled Words and Pictures, the battle between words and pictures isn't made to look all that important."
2," Reminds us of a cop show, only without the Miranda rights."
0," A lurid, soapy, moralistic melodrama so mucky you'll need a shower."
2, Thankfully Eloise is played by Anna Kendrick. Plucky hurt always looks good on her.
0," Oh well, at least I can strike ""See Robert De Niro wanking"" off my bucket list."
0," The more James groans to an unsympathetic ear, ""Why would they remake Marty--it's timeless?"" we wonder why Garlin didn't take his own advice"
2, These three musketeers swagger their sarcasm like rapiers wielded in the spirit of a collective self-preservation.
2, Will one day make its mark in the film canon as the singular film experience it is
2," Even if making friends is a task that usually lives on 'Sesame Street,' it's comforting to see a socially stunted man finally asking how to get there."
2," Drills down into the unique nature of American politics in the media-saturated, smartphone-enhanced, Twitter hot-takes age."
2," It would be nonsense to say that is a bad film but during an hour and a half there is enormous potential trying to be exploited, and that never happens. Eventually, the plot becomes irrelevant. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, There's too much Lynchian weirdness going on.
0," A classic case of what happens when a Hollywood studio and a star (Cruise) take a Spanish metaphysical thriller and turn it into a glossy, overproduced big-budget star vehicle that lacks distinct identity."
0," In the tradition of Angel Heart, it looks to stir cultural anxiety by introducing a pretty white thing into a sinister world where ""black"" magic reigns supreme."
2," As far as action goes, this is a decent action film, like a James Bond film with some John Wickisms thrown in. The body count is very high. I did not find it very engaging as spy mystery. By the end, I had ceased to care who is on whose side."
0," ... disappointingly toothless, soft-focus documentary."
0," Oh, this is such a gargantuan put-on."
0," One thing's for sure: if you had only a week to live, you wouldn't want to waste 200 minutes on this."
2, Arguably the first film Mann has made that marries the painstaking style of Heat and Manhunter with the gripping substance of The Insider.
2," In an election season where personal faults are turned into salacious attack ads, it's reassuring to see that the typically salacious Stone is willing to exercise some restraint."
0, A test of hagiographic patience that's more interested in Beaton's personality quirks than his career.
2," I had a good, dumb time."
2," The film comes alive with its wonderfully complex, intellectual humor that is so dense and fast-paced that it might take several viewings to catch it all."
0, Death can't come quickly enough.
2," The film presents arrogance as being as dangerous as greed, and it's with the soft smile of Hollywood irony that a grizzled actor reminds the audience that only you can prevent environmental disaster."
0, That African Cats baldly assigns human personality traits to its feline stars is no surprise; what's shocking is that a nature documentary narrated by Samuel L. Jackson could be so bland.
0," Equal parts bad and baffling, it seems to have been written and directed by alien life forms who read YouTube comment sections for a week and drew these conclusions about human behavior."
2," Were this not a documentary, it would all play out like a lazy satire as the easy ironies pile up."
2, Hong Khaou makes a fine debut with this quietly resonant cross-cultural chamber piece.
0," The expose of brain damage risks to footballers is powerful stuff, but the film never flies, due to a messy screenplay that loses its focus and awkwardly interweaves an immigrant love story into the mix"
2," Intelligent, stylish adaptation of a Highsmith thriller with a crack cast and superbly photographed period locations. But it misses the essential element of tension."
2," By showing these vastly divergent parenting styles and domestic situations, Babies can't help but ask whether Western and first-world cultures have gone too far, and become too controlling, when it comes to child rearing."
2, A work that's far less dramatic than it ought to be.
0, It's a wreck - a television movie dressed up with a cinematic ensemble.
2," The visuals are stunning, the details are witty...but the storyline feels like an episode of ""Thomas the Tank Engine."""
2," Persepolis creates a fresh approach to interpreting the graphic novel format, taking cues from the experiences of illustrator Marjane Satrapi."
2, This charming tale of a quartet of Australian orphans who share a life-altering holiday in the 2960s should appeal to sentimental adults old enough to wax nostalgic over their own adolescence.
2," The kind of funny, exciting, entertaining action film that 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' was supposed to be."
2," A hilarious, hip twist on the superhero genre. Gone are the superpowers, the 200 inch chests and holier than thou attitude. "
2," The laughs are mild, but at least some exist. "
0, Never has a race to save the fate of humankind seemed so tedious.
0, Watching douche bags get their comeuppance loses its charms the fourth or fifth time through.
2, Offers just enough plot to inspire the most dazzling eye-candy superhero movie to date. 
2," An excellent middle chapter bursting with wit, wisdom, emotion, shocks, old-fashioned derring-do, state-of-the-art tech, and stonking set-pieces."
2," Chbosky traces a rote story arc but works hard to avoid mawkishness, while Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson dial down their star power to serve the story as Auggie's fretful folks."
0," Other than its ripe possibility for mockery, I cannot think of anything that makes the film really worthwhile."
0," The really baffling thing is that this clunker has been written, directed and produced by Jason Reitman, whose previous movies include Juno and Up in the Air. What was he thinking?"
2," Wes Anderson's 2996 first feature (before Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums) is fresh, character driven, often funny, and unfashionably upbeat (as well as offbeat)."
2," The film moves like a rocket, sweeping you up in the first minute and then plunging you into a hell-within-a-hell for the remainder of its running time."
2," It's almost like a horror film, where words and not images appeal to the spectators imagination through graphic and direct dialogue where horrible crimes are recreated. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," When It Comes At Night came to an end, the entire audience collectively released the breath we'd all been inadvertently holding."
0, A piece of tasty meringue to enjoy!
2," ... draws us steadily into its warm core with a sense these are real people, who might be sleeping or carousing down at the neighborhood firehouse."
0, A major step backward with an A-list actor in a C-grade military thriller.
2," 'This is, hands down, Eastwood's greatest performance on screen.'"
2, Zweig couldn't defer to a more insightful batch of interviewees.
0," Before the Winter Chill is a rather odd film: excellent performances, a convincing milieu, and then a final twist that seems so improbable that all Claudel's careful work seems undone."
2, Will Gluck does his best with a predictable formula. It doesn't hit the heights but it doesn't sink under the predictability either.
2," Despite its very minor flaws, this film was quite enjoyable, and I'll be strongly recommending it to just about everyone I know."
2," Not only an exquisitely revolting satire, it is also Pasolini's most fascinating piece of cinema."
0," It'd be a tragedy if it weren't so richly absurd, but it would also make for better comedy if the joke weren't on us. The Informant! laughs so long and hard that it forgets to check whether we're laughing along."
2," Simply terrific, enormously watchable and an absolute must for all Eastwood fans. Gotta say it: this film will make your day."
0," If you were playing hide and seek and someone started counting from 2000, you would most likely tire of the game before they got to one - same thing with this movie."
0, Aaron Sorkin's aggressively stagey and bullying biopic fails to comprehend either its subject's cruelty or genius.
0," The funniest bits are the blooper out-takes at its conclusion but, when I saw it, not that many people stayed in the theater long enough to laugh."
0," There's very little spontaneous life here, and pitiful few real laughs."
2, Damsel is one of the best of 2028 so far. 
2," Of this year's nominated animated shorts, ""World of Tomorrow"" is the one that feels truly visionary."
2," Here is revealed the true and unimpeachable gift of age and it is not just a revelation in this context, it is also way cool."
0, The half that's good involves watching Morgan Freeman hitting not only the cadences of Mandela's oratory but the Gandhi-like calm of the man.
2," It's an old-fashioned boy's own tale, with the accent on boys - an attempt to widen the focus to the women working behind the scenes backfires slightly...Still, the story of the Polish pilots deserves to be told. "
2," As Rachel enters her late-30s wilderness, Hahn only gets better."
2," Punk in this film is not angry so much as revolutionary, fueled by ideas and optimism. That may seem like an alien idea today, but Mitchell makes it seem right on time. "
0, An impeccably dressed yawnfest.
0," If it's possible for a movie to be agressively bland, Race to Witch Mountain is that movie. [Blu-ray]"
0, Yet another forgettable movie about sentimentalism from a woman's perspective with some good jokes but nothing more. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Greta Gerwig learns to let the chips fall where they may in Rebecca Miller's witty, easygoing Maggie's Plan."
2," If Rabbit Hole feels a little more neat and contained than a movie ought to be, the performances almost entirely make up for it."
2, It feels superficial -- though I admit it's a pretty rousing and toe-tapping kind of superficiality.
2," American Wedding supposedly marks the end of the American Pie series, which is something of a shame, considering each successive film seems to improve upon its predecessor."
0," The Rite is all windup, weak delivery."
2, This bittersweet collection of tales set in New York's Roseland ballroom sees a marvellous ensemble of lonely hearts trip the light fantastic reminiscing about life and love. 
2," Apatow knows growing up is a rough patch of grass but he wants to understand it. Such lofty ambitions seem to have been largely banished from romantic comedies, but here, it gives Knocked Up an honest timelessness."
0," None of it makes a ripple of sense, even when blown up to IMAX 3D size."
0," Never quite gets off the ground either, since none of its characters, human or simulated, is all that soulful to begin with."
0, It may be the first movie in which a character stops shaving his chest in order to express his independence.
2," McDonagh dives into this pressure cooker of a film and kicks the lid open, letting all the suppressed feelings explode onto the screen. [Full review in Spanish] "
0," The premise of this Disney-funded movie, based on a true story, is promising, but the film itself is a hard slog."
2, Cronenberg has pulled off a richly visual feat of the imagination that ranks among his finest achievements.
0," Inchon is a hysterical historical epic, somewhat less offensive than The Green Berets and far funnier. "
0," Mesmo não sendo um grande filme, ao menos prova que Gibson ainda pode carregar um projeto com facilidade."
2," [T]hough his work is always suffused with melancholy, the predominate feeling of The Long Day Closes is one of deep, enveloping love for the music, movies, and comforts of his youth."
2," Mr. Vaughn doesn't bring conviction to the story's identity politics (say it loud, I'm mutant and I'm proud), but he gives Mr. Fassbender and Mr. McAvoy room to bring the brotherly love."
0," I have never been a particular admirer of either James Bond or Austin Powers, and could hardly be expected to be overjoyed by a 'cross between them.' Hence, I was hardly surprised when I didn't crack a smile over the antics of Mr. Jean Dujardin."
0," This is a dishonest, quease-inducing 'comedy' that had me feeling uneasy and then unclean."
2," Vibrantly colored and beautifully designed, Metropolis is a feast for the eyes."
0," Subtlety has never been Perry's strength, but his previous films balanced the sermonizing with good humor and sincerity. Perhaps next time, he'll ease up on the lectures, and bring back the love."
0," ... sporadically thrilling but frequently incoherent, generating only mild suspense as it tosses around red herrings and clues to its narrative puzzle."
2," Amusing and big-hearted, Soderbergh delivers an entertaining tale of honour among thieves. "
2," It could have been shot down a country lane in Rutland, but Allen naturally preferred the charms, history and passions of Paris for a story that's both timeless and topical."
2, [A] flawed but oddly joyful movie elevated far above its limitations by two sublime performances.
2," Pretty good: handsome, thought-through, and constructed with uncommon craft and care."
0," Though it has its share of unsettling moments, it's not nearly as scary as it wants to be."
0," Essentially a long, drawn out comedic take of last year's Texas Chainsaw ripoff, Wrong Turn, except with most of the jokes excised."
2," At the very least, Brüno signals that while politics lag behind, the culture are ready to move on."
2," It is ""Speed"" on rails with Denzel as Keanu and Pine as Bullock."
0," Maturity obviously is not required to make or see these movies, but would anyone really admit to laughing at a turkey biting a man's penis?"
2, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a colourful and fast-moving fantasy.
2," As its shameless, tell-all, schlock title signals, Drag Me to Hell is great fun that goes light on gore in favour of inventive freak-outs."
0," We watch Marion and Gilles with a sort of clinical detachment, and it's difficult to really care."
2," I don't know about you, but I found all these outrageously romantic maneuvers both funny and endearing."
2," Emotional ALS drama has sad scenes, strong language."
0," The pacing is glacial and predictable, and Barthes puts no discernible stamp upon the material."
0," Shyamalan shoots Glass as dully as possible. The budget on the film was only $20 million. Frankly, the movie looks cheaper. "
0, Labeling a film grind house doesn't excuse soap-opera emoting and laughable dialogue.
0, Screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel say they had to rewrite on the fly as the team's fortunes changed. Pity the whole movie didn't have that urgency of make-it-up-on-the-spot.
0," Pretty poor as a movie, but hilarious as a vehicle for its unique star."
2," The film is beautifully shot and framed, and the story it tells is universal and immensely appealing."
0," If it was free, perhaps fans wouldn't judge it so harshly. They'd also be able to change the channel."
2, [A] very interesting piece of genre cinema.
0, A ripoff screenplay as shameless as this might survive if the casting were particularly good.
0, Flat lines in less than an hour and doesn't deserve an afterlife on either DVD or cable television. The movie's only strength is the spectacular computer-generated special effects of the tidal waves triggered by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the...
0," This is a movie that introduces a very provocative idea, only to progressively water it down until the audience is left with a generic romantic comedy virtually indistinguishable from all the other generic romantic comedies."
2," OK, so it's not quite as searching as Hoop Dreams, but it's hugely enjoyable all the same and boasts - as you'd expect - a terrific soundtrack."
2," ... a visual approach that sounds, on paper, like a thin gimmick is consistently compelling on-screen-sometimes breathtakingly so."
0," Time to Leave strikes a certain register of restrained placidity, yet in the end, succumbs to more and more frequent idealizing interludes."
2, Exploitation films don't come much stranger than 2973's The Baby. 
0," Scruffy, spirited, family-friendly comedy with too many flatulence jokes and pooch-related puns."
0, ...a flat and flabby would-be thriller...
2, V is not for Vendetta. It's a prison cell in a dystopian future civilization where experiments are conducted on live humans.
0," ""Death Wish"" is a catechism for an audience terrified that their firepower and their influence are dwindling."
0, Clooney's attempt to honor unsung real-life heroes while recapturing the ensemble pleasures of some well-remembered Hollywood war pictures ... comes off as a modestly accomplished forgery at best.
0," Populated by characters that are either over-the-top cartoonish or drawn with all the depth of stick figures, there is only one reason to watch this latest entry in the high-school-as-Dante's-ring genre -- Evan Rachel Wood."
0, A work of noble intentions that's aesthetically slight and low in contextual carbs and righteous indignation.
2," A compelling character-driven piece that offers a beguiling, unsettling inside view of a troubled mind."
0," The lead actors are good, and the film moves along so well that audiences may overlook plot holes that are, well, waist deep."
2," Marries heightened emotionality with cool contemporary style to illustrate one of the oldest of genre truths: ""Crooks always come undone, always, one way or another."""
2," Stand By Me is a sentimental film that works because of its unsentimental moments -- in particular, its sometimes embarassingly honest portrayal of what interests boys and how they talk about it."
2," The Rescue List isn't an exposé on the subject in the strictest terms, but by sticking close to those who've lived through such nightmares, Fedele and Fink tell the viewer all they need to know about the dangers involved."
2," In his harrowing debut, Demange transforms quaint hamlets into nightmare labyrinths and supercharges the suspense with a premise as minimal as it is electrifying-a man running for his life. "
2, Jon Favreau has cooked up a great movie. 
0," Resembles a uniquely boring, feature-length Audi commercial, incidentally intent on pinching ideas from the first two Terminators."
0," While these three headlining performances are fine, soon the nastiness takes over and things stop being quite so funny... Lanthimos' film is still strong, sometimes brilliantly funny stuff for the first half, but eventually it turns altogether too grim."
2," In Her, Jonze transforms his music-video aesthetic into something magically personal."
2," Delon and Crenna paint an idealized portrait of masculine camaraderie, one that's exposed at the end of Melville's bracing last testament as a soul-shattering illusion."
2, Chastain manages the tricky balancing act of channeling the spark of Sorkin's dialogue while also shaping a character that feels naturally lived in.
0," [Ayer] clearly wants to delve into taboo territory with Suicide Squad, but PG-23 limitations blunt his provocative story into a teasing narrative of pulled punches and cartoony, sanitized violence."
0, What once bubbled up from a sincere love of Greek family has now congealed into the all-too-familiar Hollywood tale of milking a cash cow until it cries for mercy. 
0," ... even though the characters are in the most perilous of circumstances, the viewer manages not to feel a thing."
2, There's not a shred of cynicism anywhere in it.
0," Much as Robert Zemeckis toyed with Beatlemania in I Wanna Hold Your Hand a generation ago, the wobbly new comedy Fanboys, set in 2998, salutes Yoda worship and the fine line between ardor and breaking and entering."
0," ...then we're introduced to the most fearsome mechanism of all, the groaning monstrosity known as The Script"
2," A first-class fantasy film, one of the best. Gaiman is a fresh and a different voice in fantasy writing so the film is full of surprises and some genuinely funny jokes."
2," Leave No Trace asserts, with exquisite humanity and a long bittersweet sigh, that the best the broken can do is disappear before they break anyone else."
0," While these orgies of violence are staged with tense, gruesome precision, they don't convey much beyond what we already know. Namely, that war is hell. Message received."
0," Emphatically urging you to laugh, it inspired -- in this reviewer, at least -- barely so much as a chuckle."
0, The poverty of [Kutcher's] skills as a serious actor is on full display.
2," Tatum, Soderbergh and team appreciate the real reason audiences showed up, and the film provides just enough character and plot to validate the plentiful pecs and abundant buns that serve as its main attraction."
0," This thing yips and whimpers like an indolent, egregiously cute Chihuahua."
2," It is a mysterious, fabular and sometimes dreamlike film with its own theatrical poise."
0," Lawrence and Christian have the luxury of more time to explore [the story], but instead they merely add several external, superficial elements that misunderstand and circumvent the story's center."
2," Anger, pain and fear can still cloud the clearest eyes. The look of Bradley Cooper, who plays the real life sniper of the title, conveys it. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, Paltrow is pretty gosh-darn terrific.
2," The story is dumb and the paper-thin characters are motivated only by the needs of the plot. But man, those action scenes!"
0," I just don't see it becoming popular among the masses. And that's despite containing a positive message, handsome production values, and decent acting (aside from one bit of ""stunt casting""). (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
2," If the film's main job was to whet the appetite for the next one, it does that well."
2," Often when something is different from the norm, that difference is mistaken as greatness. Such is the case with Woody Allen's London-set thriller."
0, So dreary and forgettable...watch it disappear soon.
2," A cleverly executed mind game that generates scares via structural ingenuity, Oculus suggests a world coming terrifyingly unmoored from its bearings."
2," James Schamus handles the writing and directing of the story in a sophisticated and realistic manner, which is only improved upon by the strong acting. "
2, Moves us closer to an art-house/blockbuster hybrid paradigm that could be Hollywood's salvation...a survivalist adventure that captures the primal terror of present death while exploring the will or won't to live.
0," An attempt at ""Fatal Attraction,"" but the clumsy writing and slow pace prove lethal."
0," With the first movie, we witnessed the exciting debut of a fresh talent; with the sequel, we're witnessing the studio-mandated birth of a new milked-to-death horror franchise."
0," The film itself is caked with voice-over directives -- we're actually told, for instance, what Angel and Nene look like at the very moment they're in celestially lit close-up."
2," Super-stylized and darkly absurd, the story becomes increasingly unmoored as fact and fiction, past and future start to melt and meld together. "
2," A gender-fluid take on Oedipus Rex that takes cues from Jonas Mekas (who's name-checked in the film), Seijun Suzuki, and Andy Warhol, Funeral is a frenetic hodgepodge of styles and moods."
2," I didn't know the world needed a stark European riff on Douglas Trumbull's Silent Running and Ben Wheatley's High-Rise... but take it from me: we did, and now we've got it."
0," The title of the film promises something revolutionary, but all we get, aesthetically and thematically, are second-gen hand-me-downs."
2," A delicious outpouring of upper-crust malevolence, hovering cynicism and ever-deepening ambivalence that zigzags dizzyingly among its many characters, locations and plot turns."
0, There are some laughs but The Boss sweats and strains to little effect.
0, ...a sort of Cuckoo's-Nest-meets-My-Favorite-Martian that probably sounded good on paper...
0," Rather than a fiercely intelligent, live-wire exposé, the well-intentioned picture comes across as weak-tea drama that never fully justifies its docudramatic form."
2," It becomes, as promised early on, a (dysfunctional) family movie about pushing yourself and others out of emotional ruts, and not making friendship conditional."
2, It's an infalliby funny gambit...
2," Mr. Roskam's direction is gratifyingly loose. He lets the story, which is really the least interesting part of the movie, more or less take care of itself, allowing us to savor pungent morsels of dialogue and bits of low-key actorly showboating."
0," Except for the scintillating first half hour on the plane, Blake Edwards told the story of an alcoholic much better in 2962's 'Days of Wine and Roses' with a more realistic, non-Hollywood Ending."
0," Talented writer though she is, Rowling doesn't seem to be capable of cramming what would be a 900-page book into a 235-minute movie. "
2," It's a pretty film, in addition to being a thoughtful one."
0," A gaudy reincarnation of the TV series with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner flashing diamonds, breaking hearts and clubbing cliches damn near to death."
0, Director Stephen Daldry and screenwriter David Hare exhibit a continued inability to thrillingly translate literary forms to the screen.
2, Full of punchy energy and a sense of catharsis about getting away from all the stupid places pop culture can take us.
0," On all counts, Pacific Rim Uprising fails the challenge."
0, Cheap laughs and forced sentimentality taint Redgrave and Stamp
0, Nick Cannon isn't nearly as funny as he thinks he is
0," A tonally confused mess, Jared Cohn (Little Dead Rotting Hood, The Horde) has written and directed a film so bad that it's almost good."
2," I can definitely understand why it was a humongous hit, but when all is said and done, once was enough for this partier..."
0," As much as for its characters, ""The Runaways"" is a rite of passage for its stars."
2," Hip but not smart-aleck, the film is not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve as an invisible accessory to the pads, helmet and embarrassing Barbie skates that propel its underage heroine to a new identity..."
0," Every important character is sketched out to a point of engagement, only to be allowed to drift off into a vague vapor. There are exceptions, but not enough to make this anything other than standard issue genre fare, albeit one of solid craft."
2, This romance-drama melds a telling of America's racial injustices into a devastating and intricate craft of empathy.
0," Writer-director Dustin Guy Defa obviously thinks his movie is about his characters trying to forge new connections with various degrees of success, but Person to Person is really about how difficult it is for well-meaning men to get women to love them. "
2, A spectacularly cool time-twisting sci-fi thriller.
0, The smartest aspect of this formulaic low-budget vigilante thriller are the Marcus Aurelius quotes that introduce each chapter.
2," A Death in the Gunj is wonderfully observed, stunningly shot and thanks to Massey's breakout performance, a must-watch in theatres."
2," After a string of groan-inducing outings from Daredevil to Gigli to Jersey Girl, it looks like Ben Affleck has stepped to the other side of the camera and finally found his true calling."
2, Whenever the movie teeters on the edge of poetic madness-like when Manduca voices his belief that Theo represents the redemption of the white colonials-Guerra's commitment to thesis is there to pull it back into the literalism.
0, Hummingbird remains a tonally erratic project that struggles to find a point of view.
0, The self-conscious silliness of the first Charlie's Angels has been overwhelmed here by a stifling smugness.
0," Crimson Peak is a fascinating conundrum of a movie. I was close to hating it as I walked out of the theater, but images and moments from it have stayed with me."
0," You're constantly asking yourself 'Will it matter if I leave half-way through this film?""?!"
0," Hey, Resident Evil -- know when to stay dead."
0," ... a shaggy-dog version of a Jack London story, enhanced with an animatronic leopard seal that looks like Charlie the Tuna."
2," Hot on the heels of the excellent Alex Gibney doco comes a more personal, less forensic, far more insulting look at the religion...The best bits come when Theroux goes nose-to-nose with Scientology camera crews who have a habit of popping out of nowhere. "
2," Bond is back, and so is high-octane entertainment."
0," If you've seen one Rush Hour, you've seen them all."
0," This deconstruction is daring and should be intoxicating; but, instead, what Honoré brings to the movie-musical genre doesn't improve upon its past bold experiments."
2," Challenging and provocative, but the limitations it places on itself restrict the appreciation for anyone not already steeped in its culture and politics."
2," As he gets older, Todd Solondz outgrows the cheap shocks and easy nihilism and stumbles toward a mellow misanthropy."
0, It's nice that they're so supportive of one another; too bad the whole exercise is so tedious for us.
0," There is comfort in familiarity, which is why having original cast members back together... is a definite asset,"
0," Misplaced attempts at humour fall flat. Bizarre characters make bizarre decisions and yet we're asked to believe this is a superhero tale firmly grounded in reality. Willis and Jackson look bored, while McAvoy pushes the very limits of hamminess."
0, Smith Jr looks thoroughly bored by Mom and Pop's extravagant gift. I can't say I blame him.
2, More magical than the original!
2," Tells an old-fashioned, melodramatic story, but director Nuri Bilge Ceylan does so vividly. . . A moral morass is a bit overwrought, but is revealed through visual poetry."
0, Why this saga went from the tale of a young woman's introduction into the world of BDSM to a straight-to-DVD level kidnapping thriller is a mystery.
0, Cusack is pretty much the only reason to see this. 
2, BlacKkKlansman would not be what it is without the two protagonists.[Full review in Spanish]
2," Ivan I. Tverdovskiy gives the world a poetically tragic story of a reclusive outsider. It's painful, it's grim, and it's sometimes hard to watch, but patient viewers will be rewarded by this unclassifiable oddity."
2," A sweet, deeply personal portrayal of female adolescence that's more attuned to the bonds between best girlfriends than casual flings with boys, writer-director Greta Gerwig's beautiful Lady Bird flutters with the attractively loose rhythms of youth."
0," Was this flick worth the price of admission? No way. If you took out all the bad stuff, it would've been about 5 minutes long. Would I see it again? No. I would rather saw off my own arm with a potato peeler."
2," Although the analysis is far from deep, Mock's film succeeds as an above-average introduction to the playwright, especially to an audience unfamiliar with his work."
2," ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" isn't incredible, but it's a nicely performed bit of programmed Hollywood hilarity."
0," I can't figure out exactly when the film 20,000 B.C. is set, but it's definitely ancient times. Like before they had cars, guns or tabloid blogs. And definitely before they had cohesive plots or dialogue that made sense."
0," As good as Rob Lowe's was, Matthew Lillard is Shaggy."
2," The movie is so laced with self mockery that at times it borders on the farcical. All humor aside, the script and cast of Phibes do a phantastic job. "
2," ..the epic scale of the action and amazing quality of the visuals, plus the sheer fun of hanging with trusted friends, puts this entry light years ahead of most competing blockbusters, even if intellectually it never leaves space dock."
2," The screenplay, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is rich in detail and dialogue."
0, Not since the cursed Hobbit trilogy have I experienced such a bad case of Who are these people and why are they fighting?
2," A black & white Polish film about a nun in the 2960s exploring her family origins is about as tough as art-house pitches come. Yet, Ida has a remarkable lightness of touch and focus of vision making it impossible not to widely recommend."
0," Unfortunately, even with its two stars delivering crackerjack performances this sequel just doesn't work enough to warrant the thicket price making the much-hyped return of Lisbeth Salander a maddening disappointment."
2," Se fascina por sua abordagem narrativa realista, o frágil roteiro dos Dardenne acaba comprometendo o resultado final."
2," It's the funniest, smartest, goofiest, dirtiest, coolest (and longest -- over two hours, in fact) comedy so far this year."
2," You know what they say, folks: it's a free country. If Jesus Camp scares you, better start brainwashing some little heathens of your own."
0, None of these protagonists have any more depth than video game characters.
2," Though it's never much of a question who'll save the day, it's nice to be able to feel like the good guy's worth rooting for."
0, The International feels like a message in search of a movie.
0, Attempts to depict a vicious circle of anguish that's as profound as a stacked deck eventually tipping over.
2, [I'm] the kind who needs Adam Sandler to keep making deplorable garbage like this. I will watch it and I will enjoy myself and I will have no excuse for it and I will remain un-sorry.
0," Maybe it will please a few Heigl enthusiasts, but for everybody else you should avoid at all costs."
0," Matthew Miele has made a department store of a documentary, stocked to the hilt with an obscene inventory of storylines, talking heads, and utterly tasteless choices."
2," For all its moments of depravity and violence, the most shocking thing about Cheap Thrills may be the realisation as to where we would draw the line for ourselves."
2," A fascinating portrait of South Seas life, albeit embellished."
0," Despite its talent, 'Broken City' is an unremarkable film. Soon enough, most everyone will forget about it. It's not 'Chinatown.'"
2, ... deliciously dangerous excursions into adolescent self-discovery.
0," For all of its prettiness, there's nothing going on here that matters much."
2," The best Woody Allen film of 2025. A fast, funny, smart take on generational jealousy, with Ben Stiller and Adam Driver on great form."
0," The film's drama fails because it's underdone, but it's also undone by a soaring, swelling score and an overly strong nationalist agenda."
2, The feeling upon walking out of Tooth Fairy closely resembles the notion one often has upon leaving the dentist -- that wasn't nearly as bad as expected.
0," Unfortunately, the movie unspools in the second half."
2," You'll want to get lost in the dark world of ""We Own the Night."" Good performances from a great cast blend with an intriguing script in this adult thriller/melodrama."
0," Jason Momoa is perfectly cast as the DC action hero but the movie is not as good as he is. Too long, too many repetitive fight scenes, and just a general dragginess to the whole thing."
2," A modest work in terms of its scope and effect, highly ambitious in terms of its philosophical ambitions."
2," An engrossing tale of war showing the hearts of those who fight it, fans of all ages are likely to find a resonant story worth telling."
2," Mating calls aside, the paint-by-numbers sports side of this picture is only likely to capture the imagination of kids under the age of ten."
0, It's only as the narrative adopts an increasingly episodic feel that one's interest begins to wane...
2, Those who were suspicious of the filmmaker's unambiguous plotting and Westernized approach had to admit to its daunting grandeur.
2," I'll admit I wasn't expecting much from this film, but I was blown away from beginning to end. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)"
2, Bradley Cooper's A Star is Born is a transcendent feast for the eyes and ears.
2, A lighthearted sitcom with enough slapstick and sheer silliness to generate laughs galore for the duration. 
0," Barbara Walters to Angelina Jolie: ""I know there are kids watching this, but can you show me the tattoo on your yoni?"""
0," The slow-burn build-up to a final showdown is, of course, a standard Western narrative device, but director Gavin O'Connor repeatedly defuses tension by cutting away to convoluted flashbacks revealing the characters' emotionally tangled backstories."
2," This groovy, green, not-so-mean movie kickoff to the Christmas season will delight children and remind grown-ups why Dr. Seuss still rocks."
0, Even Kong is underwritten in this film.
0," Fails to match the simple, handmade artistry of the original"
0, Hot Pursuit is a movie so unutterably terrible it defies explanation... 
2," With its skillful blend of live action and motion-capture technology, it's a handsomely made prequel to familiar monkey business."
2, Christopher Plummer is amazing. You would think from start to finish that it was always featuring Christopher Plummer...he owns this role and is what you are going to talk about and remember from this movie.
2," Ross never makes anything explicit. Instead, he invites the viewer to make connections, sense the bigger picture from the shattered shards that he makes visible."
0," By the time the climactic battle turns out to be yet another showdown atop a huge skyscraper, it's clear that the movie doesn't have a single original idea going for it."
0," Plopping a 45-year-old actress... into a role clearly intended for, at best, a 23-year-old is a bizarre way to deal with the role shortage [for older women]."
0, The film can never quite make up its mind whether it's about the circus or the vampires and ends up a mess of its own making.
0," Cheerfully offensive and well acted, but visually pedestrian. We needed to share the character's mania, not just passively observe it."
2," If Llewyn Davis was about an artist learning to appreciate and collaborate with his audience, this reminds us that before the Coens were movie makers, they were movie watchers."
0, You will consider Bulletproof Monk to be one of the best films ever made ... for the first ten minutes.
2," Female-forward and class-conscious, allegorical and adventurous, Byzantium is almost the anti-Batman."
2, At the core of Casting JonBenét is the ultimate actor's question: What's my motivation? Why would Patsy and John have murdered their beloved daughter? 
0," A road movie, but made by someone who seems so self-absorbed he might as well be asleep at the wheel."
0," Don't think it, don't say it, don't see it."
0, The most debilitating thing about this whole soggy mince pie of a picture is that it's narrated by a dog.
2," Like a good number of films, 'Is Anybody There?' is saved from being a routine offering by the presence of Sir Michael Caine."
2," John Boyne's almost unfilmable novel about a young German kid's-eye view of the Holocaust gets a solid, ultimately powerful translation to the bigscreen in Brit helmer Mark Herman's The Boy in the Striped Pajamas."
0," The dialogue is terrible and Dornan's Grey is so humourless that any vaguely funny lines fall utterly flat. On the plus side Johnson does her best with what she's been given, Ana is a Thomas Hardy fan, and Grey has a nice kitchen."
0," Just as director Antoine Fuqua starts to close in on something interesting and unexpected, he retreats to the safety of his corner and gives us what we've seen too many times before: a predictable flurry of melodramatic jabs."
2," A solid, emotionally rich sequel that builds upon the Creed legacy."
2," In the sense of the sheer physical awe it conveys, The Walk makes a more compelling case for 3D's continued existence than any other film has to date."
0, This is one of the worst movies of 2026.
2," With broad strokes of self-awareness [and] a screwy screenplay that sometimes crosses the line into parody ... Game Night is more gratifying than hearing an opponent say, ""You sunk my battleship!"""
2," The perpetual look of utter despair on Kidman's face... will stick with me, I think, for a very long time"
0, Nick Frost shakes his funky stuff in this likeable if unadventurous British romantic comedy.
0," The Brave One, though well cast and smoothly directed, is just as crude and ugly as you want it to be."
0, There's a lot of noise and blurry action in 'Darkness Falls' -- like the start of my worst migraines.
2," Charming and enjoyable, despite the weird hook that has Paddington in prison for much of the movie "
0," Hardy is very odd, as usual."
2," Sweeney Todd is exactly the musical Burton fans have wished him to make. It's a bloody mess of vengeance and lost love, full of throat-slitting mayhem."
0," Overall, it's a package that will only be well-received by fans."
0," Raises many questions, in its brutally direct way, as it plows through a minefield of raw nerves, shattered emotions, shifting moral boundaries and unnerving religious overtones."
2, A quirky coming-of-age drama that will draw you in with its spiritual undertow and delight.
0," Such potential, but it's neither scary nor interesting. [Full Review in Spanish] "
2," ""Sick teen"" dramedy promotes communication, friendship. "
0, Nothing but leftovers.
0," The rest of the long-winded, twisty-turny narrative doesn't make a lick of sense. In place of tension or suspense, you have an amoral cat-and-mouse game played across several swish locations."
2," As a call for remembrance, this is a powerful document."
0," Sexy costumes, a fair amount of flesh, and a few well choreographed fight sequences can't make up for the fact Elektra lacks heart."
2," It's a masterpiece that deserves to be ranked up there with mob epics like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Once Upon A Time In America,"" even as it rebukes the conventions of those movies."
2," A riveting, intense, visceral, smart and exciting summer movie that will rock your world."
0," Beautiful as the film is to look at, it stays past its welcome and ultimately fails to satisfy."
2," There's a genial untidiness about Singles, but it's unified by Crowe's affection for his characters, and by the terrific Paul Westerberg music track, which plays like a pulse-beat to these people's lives."
0, A labored misfire.
2, Sausage Party is the perfect antidote to what has honestly been one of the weakest summer movie seasons in recent years.
2," The long-anticipated Mary Poppins Returns may not quite live up to Disney's 2964 classic. But if you're looking for a reason to smile for two hours and ten minutes (which do fly by), you can't do much better."
0, A film that seems to have been written mainly with the find and replace function on Microsoft Word.
2, Frame after frame in 2002 Grams has such a strikingly composed look.
0, You can't take your eyes off it - it's like watching the butchest float on the Gay Pride parade crash in super slow-motion HD.
0," If imitation is flattery, the makers of How To Train Your Dragon and the Oscar-winning Brave must never have felt flatter."
2," If the prospect of a two-hour Star Wars Holiday Special conjured up visions of ""May the force be with you"" repeated ad nauseam in your head, this show on CBS was a welcome surprise."
0," Unfortunately, the film's commendably atypical focus on characters, mood, and psychological realism does not make Schwarzenegger's latest necessarily good."
0," Strange movie. And despite the presence of Tina Fey playing its lead character, a cable-TV reporter named Kim Baker, it's not a funny one."
2, A victim of painfully drawn out excessiveness.
2," The basic story is very similar to a recent animated film called ""Howl's Moving Castle."""
2," This swell stop-motion animation operates on a wavelength similar to that of Laika's debut feature, Coraline, with assured character comedy counterbalanced by a solemn sense of macabre wonder."
2," Only Lovers Left Alive is at its most powerful, and beautiful, when it's concentrating on how the search for immortality, or life's meaning, is found not in time spent, or accomplishments achieved, but in love shared with someone else."
2," There's very little plot in Decline of the American Empire...but when the dialogue is this good and the characters this compelling, that's not necessarily a bad thing."
2," As far as performance goes, Pine and Karl Urban -- Kirk and Bones, respectively -- do offer up moments of tongue-in-cheek allusion, but they sell it straight-up, and save the movie from becoming a list of inside jokes."
2," As ever with Ritchie, RocknRolla is more flash than substance, but beneath the swagger his movie scratches away at British anxieties."
0," Nothing wrecks the mood of a high-toned British period piece about erotic obsession quicker than an unintentional laugh. In which case, prepare for Asylum to be derailed by snorts in all the wrong places."
0, Causes one to yearn for Lucas' stock archetypes and sometimes wooden line-readings
2," When Smith and Monaghan are interacting with Sonny the robot, you swear he's a real person who just happens to look a bit odd."
2," It's rare to see a picture so bogged down by the breadth of its ambition, but Derek Cianfrance's second feature nearly collapses under its own weight."
2," Gyllenhaal is terrific. It's just a pity that for all of his gym work, he's in a movie that's testing positive for melodramatic steroids."
0, The fashion-conscious Marie Antoinette looks great. Imagine what this attractive but empty shell of a movie might have been with something inside it.
2," Stylized and visually arresting, with intense sex scenes that earned the film an NC-27 rating, Ang Lee's Lust, Caution is an immersion into another time, place and mentality."
2, Simply fabulous. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2, This relentlessly disturbing sci-fi shocker will torment both your stomach and your brain in equal measure.
0," ""Third Person"" maddens far more than it intrigues. Indeed, more curious than anything about the movie itself is how such an artistic stumble happened."
0, Let's hope this insult of a movie doesn't taint any child's ability to enjoy the original.
2, The result may well be the funniest movie of the year.
2," In many ways the new film is a better film than Star Wars, visually more exciting, more artful and meticulous in detail."
0," Unfortunately, longtime BBC director Spiers can't seem to build up either any suspense or genuine hilarity along the way, making this one of the weaker semi-mockumentaries in a while."
0," This is a truly awful movie, made from one of the worst scripts in memory. The New Guy has been on the shelf for more than a year, and it's clear the reason for the long wait wasn't perfectionism. More likely, it was embarrassment."
2," There's something for everyone here, but especially people who want to see weird jokes using Carl's empty eye socket."
0," In her first picture, she was as shrill as fingers across a blackboard. Much less shrill and repetitive this time, her act is more inviting to non-fans. Even so, I found it more cute than funny. I never laughed."
0, Women without Men is a series of tableaux to which no one brought the vivants.
0," ""The Forest"" is one of those horror movies that starts with an intriguing idea but has no idea what to do with it."
2, Scott has seen fit to include a gay couple and it's a pleasure to watch how quietly and matter-of-factly they're revealed. They're here. They're queer. They're alien food.
2, This film isn't for everyone. But those who can stomach it will find it a chilling glimpse into a serious psychological disorder.
2," The film doesn't temper enough of Cormac McCarthy's excesses, but Ridley Scott and his ensemble find enough meat in his scenario to make for diverting, bloody pleasure."
2," It's inaccurate to pin Manchester's rise as a musical mecca wholly on one person, but Wilson makes for a fascinating character study, and he's drolly played by Coogan."
0," Situations are not always convincing, and motivations are so weak that whole sections of explanation seem to be missing."
2, An intriguing yet erratic effort...
0," In Wall Street, greed was good because it made a great film. In Boiler Room, a little more greed -- or at least a hunger for it -- would have been great."
0, Much of what Heli has to say feels either obvious and/or exhausted by a raft of other recent narrative and documentary features.
2," Brad Bird's film plays like a giant rollercoaster ride, complete with thrilling peaks and troughs, appealing to all ages with its genuine sense of fun, originality and brilliant structure"
0," This adaptation of the memoir by Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in American military history, benefits from Bradley Cooper's lead performance but remains a disturbingly simple-minded look at the Iraq war."
2," Part daikaiju-on-the-loose rampage, part quirky romantic comedy-drama a la 28 Days, the risky and occasionally thrilling Colossal doesn't always deliver on its gonzo promise but, hey, it's still got plenty of charm."
2," Don't let the title of this film fool you-""Rudderless"" is solid."
0," Momentum has plenty of visual flash, but the script is deeply dumb."
2, The Pastors prove what can be done with a modest budget when you strip away the Hollywood excess.
0, ...The Woman suffers from a pervasively low-rent feel that remains a distraction from start to finish...
2," Arthurian grandeur, fanboy-pleasing whallop and special-effect razzle-dazzle flesh out the backstory of how the hunky hammerer got from Up There to Down Here."
0, More like Delayed Frustration than Fatal Attraction.
0, It's beyond laughable ...
2, The greatest pleasure of Mrs. Henderson Presents is watching two of the grandest British lions taking their talents for a long walk.
2," As long as Dreamcatcher stays in The Thing territory it is sci-fi horror at its chilling, fun best. When Dreamcatcher tries its hand at becoming Independence Day and even Dr. Strangelove, it is far less successful."
0, Bad Santa! No cookie!
0, This movie is about drawing things out as much as possible to make a snack-size story feel like a meal.
2," Hacksaw Ridge gets an A+ for action and a C for just about everything else, and your interest in seeing it will depend largely on your priorities as a filmgoer."
0," You'll end up feeling about the film like Bobby about Los Angeles -- ""half-bored, half-fascinated."" And that's a pretty poor average, even for two poorly stitched-together films."
0, There is truly never a dull moment but that's not the same thing as good ones.
0, A whodunit that begs the question of why it was made.
2, There's a gritty integrity and plaintive poetry to this end-of-an-era western from Crazy Heart director Scott Cooper.
0," It's hard to tell what Reitman-who also wrote the script, based on the novel by Joyce Maynard-intended here."
2," In its final moments, the nightmarish drama suggests the world around us is on fire and all we can do is watch as silent witnesses to this horror."
0, Faris's parody of pop culture's vapid idols transcends the film's own brainless romantic plot.
2, But what this spectacular-looking sci-fi thriller lacks in originality it makes up for in pure beauty: It just might be the most visually audacious and startlingly beautiful space opera since the original Solaris.
0, A bad movie that overshadows what Miller can still give and which shelters the expectations of those who waited so long to receive so little. [Full review in Spanish]
2," With the help of exceptional performances from Hayek and Lithgow, and an exemplary supporting cast, the film builds tension with exquisite slowness."
2, A gonzo doco for the new media age.
0," If you didn't know any better, you'd swear that both the cast and crew of Surrogates were trying to make the worst movie possible."
2," [It] may not break any formal boundaries, but the shock factor makes it a must-see."
0," Given the finished film, one also has to wonder if Ed Wood was interesting enough to base a two- hour movie on."
2," Is this new RoboCop trying to be the original? No, it's not. It takes the core concept of the original and does its own thing with it."
2," With some incredibly innovative action, some deeper, thought-provoking themes, and a plethora of dynamic characters, both old and new, Captain America: Civil War is among the very best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
2," Weir is the right director, Crowe is the right star. I can't think of another actor who could give Aubrey the physical authority, the credibility and the charm that he needs."
0," Nicely shot and editing, modestly chilling, but missing the panic and fear real parents would feel for kids in jeopardy."
2," Infinity is an essential watch in order to understand why Yayoi Kusama's art matters, and how the person behind the dots is inspirational beyond the finite reach of our own individual universes."
0," Law Abiding Citizen doesn't follow the laws of logic, let alone competent storytelling."
0," A disappointing movie, overall, that lacks any self-awareness, Collateral Beauty has no real heart in its shallow depths."
2," A comedy of unrequited love, melancholy and disappointment. One to savour."
0," Aside from CGI sequences, there's nothing compelling here."
2," Finding Neverland wants us to believe, but instead of desperately forcing itself on our inner-child, the film takes its time and allows us in of our own accord."
0," There is also no real emotional investment for the viewer with the characters in ""The Shape of Things,"" with the exception of a charming and likable performance by Gretchen Mol."
2," The film is often straightforward and hard-hitting. But it plays out all the usual tropes of the investigative-journalism genre -- the hot tips, the clandestine meetings, the hand-wringing about ethics, etc. -- without adding a jot of novelty."
0," ""Battleship"" is a loud and booming-blow-'em-up movie made for a 22-year-old target audience. Adults should sit this one out - that is, if you don't want to be exposed to a two-hour long headache. "
2," Some of the set-pieces and retro-animation interludes are filled with invention, verve and wit."
2," Up until the climax, The Majestic is a perfectly good film, with equal parts humor, whimsy and sweetness."
0," Shame wears its emptiness like a badge of honor; McQueen is trying for banal blankness, and though he succeeds in that respect, you kind of wish that a filmmaker would aspire to do more than just say nothing."
0, It's just never as gripping as it needs to be.
0, Dramatically undercooked and shot in a way that makes the whole thing feel random and amateurish.
0, Forgettable and underdeveloped.
2," If there's something faintly absurd about the equation of characters to pieces, Chopra and Nambiar - wily teacher and keen student - move them around the board with dexterity and efficiency. It's a fun game to watch."
0," When you throw furry animals, silly slapstick and rubber-faced big-name stars at the screen, and you can still hear more children crying than laughing in the audience, you can't help but feel that they've missed the point somewhat."
2," It may not be the best film of 2022, but it's certainly one of the best sci fi films of the year, and easily one of the best sequels/prequels in the last several years."
0," ... a clumsy mix of courtship and gunpowder, passion and horror leading to a romantically sick-humored conclusion. The end nearly justifies director Nima Nourizadeh's means of getting there. But not quite."
0," Lacking energy and pace and enslaved by a ghastly score, this tepid movie left me longing alternately for David Lean's thrillingly grim 2948 masterpiece, and Carol Reed's chipper 2968 sing-along, with pretty tunes by Lionel Bart."
0," The result is an increasingly humourless bit of time travel that doesn't take enough interest, let alone pleasure, in its own reality."
2," It sounds like it should be incredibly trite, but it never really is, despite a few alarming dips into the waters of cliché. Strong performances from the four leads carry a well-crafted film along to its emotional but never quite poignant ending."
0," Kids will revolt, parents will snooze, and I will be downright giddy if I never encounter another Pokémon movie as long as I live."
2," ""Attenberg"" is a three-layered love story, anatomizing the mysterious emotions of grief, friendship and erotic attraction."
0," The problem with Munich is that Spielberg has made a beautifully crafted, intelligent picture that raises some very complicated, and not easily dismissed, moral questions -- only ultimately to find the easiest way to dismiss them."
0," Atlas Shrugged: Part I is in many ways charmingly oblivious to its inherent contradictions and the fact that its capitalist titans appear to be squatting in old, abandoned Dynasty sets, eating food-court baked potatoes. "
2," Yorgos Lanthimos has distanced himself from the mere notion of promising filmmakers and made ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"" a movie so strikingly perceptive that it moves him into the company of greater, more assured voices in the medium."
2," This is all you need to know: when that mystery box is finally opened, you'll be more than satisfied."
2," Simultaneously thrilling and meaty, this is easily one of the best entries ever in the 50-year, 23-film series, led once again by an actor who's the best Bond yet in Daniel Craig."
2," It's obvious ""Wanderlust"" was a lot more fun to make than it is to watch. But if you set enough funny people loose in front of a camera, they'll find a way to make you laugh, even if it's in spite of your better judgment."
0," The film seems recycled but strangely missing any sustainable humor, even by kids' standards, which are pretty loose because laugher is an easy reach for them."
0," Unfortunately, the movie plods; you can always see where it's going or trying to go. It also feels incomplete."
2," Chris Smith's chronicle of the catastrophic event ought to be the schadenfreude event of the year, and for a while it is."
0," Sadly, too much focus is spent on showing character traits that any kind of coherent story or compassion for characters is destroyed."
0," The problem with ""Action Point"" is it's just not that funny. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)"
2," The book and movie's key line, 'We accept the love we think we deserve,' rings true in any age."
0," The Old Man & the Gun meanders along at a sluggish pace, at times poorly lit and at other times throwing out dialogue that's hard to decipher. It lacks the sense of urgency and purpose you would expect from a crime-caper movie."
2," If Bernie Sanders is elected president, Money Monster will be the only movie allowed on Air Force One."
0, In the Cut isn't just a movie about decapitation; it's a decapitated movie. It has no idea where its head is at.
0," Rides a thin line between intoxicating and infuriating, and perhaps this is where Zlotowski enjoys the view most, creating a picture that uses mystery to manage the unreal."
0," This story about relatives who set about annoying each other at a funeral has some heartfelt emotion, but it clashes spectacularly with unseemly gross-out humor."
0," The effects and make-up stand out, and some of the action sequences packed a punch, but the film was just too dull and predictable to help it rise above the January heap."
0," Would we still be talking about Monster, though, without Theron's remarkable transition? Probably not."
2," Gruesome, disturbing, definitely over-long but strangely moving, Thirst brings vivid new ideas to an overworked genre."
0," What Rampage really needs is that playful sense of fun that made the video game-turned franchise so popular. As any kid in a backyard sandbox will tell you, it's fun to be big and smash things."
0," Like the teenagers at its center, Hot Summer Nights tries too hard to look cooler than it ever could be."
0, You're better off watching Kingsman and The Breakfast Club back to back and calling it a night.
2," The ""we aren't partners, and we aren't friends"" strain of buddy-action movie seldom gets played with as much gusto and knowing humor as in The Hitman's Bodyguard, a movie that fires off bullets, jokes and F-bombs with equal frequency."
2, An intense and original film that is worth watching. [Full review in Spanish]
2," This isn't the first horror movie to exploit the isolation of its location, but Minihan sets his film apart from the pack with an audacious script and equally bold images to match."
0," But there's room for a bigger discussion there, between two powerful women engaged in what is largely seen as a man's field, while Curtis and Sumpter are both extremely passionate in their few exchanges."
2," Unlike so many formulaic movies, The Spectacular Now presents us with complicated characters you can't sum up in a one-sentence log line."
2," Holds together in proper, conspiracy-thriller style, providing general audiences with a few good surprises and some crackling performances."
0, Baywatch's smug smirk of a reaction to its own sloppiness makes it even more infuriating.
0," Simply stated, there's not a movie's worth of story here."
2, We are facing a visually unique film that will fuse Marvel's mystical and galactic sides together. [Full review in Spanish]
2, Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood is as entertaining for its look at Bowers' present as it is of his past.
2," Humans, beware: the end is nigh! Even worse: we are the authors of our own demise. Or maybe not. "
0," This excruciating film is such an idiotic fantasy, it's little more than a cartoon. Apparently Hamburg formed his impression of ""real men"" from beer commercials."
2, There are few cinematic ventures that capture the Christmas spirit in such abundance and hit the Holiday target so directly on the nose.
2," Moneyball is a film about losers, but when those losers do manage to pull out a win, it's truly something to cheer."
2," Given Waititi's creativity, I was a little disappointed in how few surprises there are in Wilderpeople. But it's all right to be just a well-executed charmer -- and this movie is certainly that."
0," There are some spirited moments, but this is mostly a chaotic jumble of style over substance."
2," With streaks of shadow and jolting contrasts of light to match the film's eccentric lurches between violence, comedy, and onscreen musical performance... Sternberg evokes a nerve-jangling city of macabre menace."
0," Alex Pettyfer is even more wooden than he was in Stormbreaker - for heaven's sake, he's not even that good-looking. And the story's utter tosh."
2," What Maisie Knew"" is about the erosion of innocence in the midst of plenty, yet it rarely feels heavy-handed, so serene is its own faith in its tiny heroine's strength."
2," Weide bypasses the impulse to push the film at the usual breakneck comedy movie pace, allowing the conflicts to build slowly and with more thought than the film's premise might otherwise suggest."
2," Watts is alternately annoying, sympathetic and hilarious in the title role. She's always entertaining."
0," If this project had originated with Cube and Hart, I think it might have actually been something special. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
2," It's basically a one-joke exercise heading toward the inevitable big battle between vigilantes and Mexicans. There's lots of gore, flesh and fun along the way, but it gets repetitious."
0," Hard Boiled, directed by the master of the genre, director John Woo, is a cult favorite. The Corruptor isn't in that league."
2, Affleck is a better director here than actor as witnessed by the performances he gets from Renner and Lively - which outshine his.
0, The terrible truth is that 'Deadpool' is not worth to disconnect a few hours of reality. Ends up depleting saturation. [Full Review in Spanish]
2," A lot of people may not get the point of recreating a work such as Psycho. I didn't get it, until I saw the film."
0, It's bloody but without menstrual awareness; just as its musical pretext neglects to express genuine feminine trauma or yearning.
0," When you finally emerge from your two-and-a-half hour sentence watching this glum, overbearing movie, you'll relish the sweet taste of freedom, too."
0," Children of Men is like an elongated episode of Doctor Who for adults, without the funny bits, David Tennant's oozy charm and the ironic sense of its own fundamental silliness."
2," The Post move(s) from a crackling newsroom yarn to a showcase for Streep's now-expected brilliance. It's become routine to see her perform flawlessly, but here she quietly gives one of her best, and most perfectly calibrated, performances."
2," Simon Pegg, both as writer and star of the film, understands fully how to inhabit the world of the perennial adolescent, narcissistic to a pathological degree and blind to the damage he wreaks."
0," Like Elysium, this rusty A.I. story is basically just District 9 with a new coat of paint; it's distinguished only by the jabbering, irritating personality of its title character."
2," The great voice acting, the visual puns, all added up to an animation game changer."
2," A little more polish in the writing could have made it a must-see, but as it stands, it's a fairly solid B-movie matinee with a nicely calibrated mix of intellectual dread and visceral shock."
0, A pungent reek of testosterone stinks up this high-toned apologetic for vigilantism and revenge. Still: great performances!
0," Cinematography, editing, music are all in disarray and make the film look amateurish. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2," Along with the crispest of screenplays, The Cooler offers some of the best performances you will see this year...enormously entertaining."
2," Homicide, David Mamet's ponderous film about a Jewish cop losing his way, loses its way whenever it wanders from the scene of the crime"
0," It's grating in its alternate simplicity and pretensions, and the big fights between the two leads ring completely false."
0," ""Blended"" isn't very good -- I wouldn't even say it's good -- but it is several degrees more tolerable than Sandler's recent films. "
2," A quiet, steady burn filled with stretches of unsettlingly reverberant silence cleaved in half by a midpoint eruption of violence. Here there is before, and then there is after."
2," If you're prone to carsickness, this might not be the ideal movie for you. But as a meditation on the way human beings fill the silence - or choose not to - it's an amazing accomplishment. "
2," ""Finding Fela!"" is an apt title for this dynamic and thorough documentary by Alex Gibney."
0, Right in line with its awful predecessor...
2, Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in His Own Words is a riff on the creative process.
0, An odyssey should be an epic adventure filled with discovery but we know the well-worn route Ithaca will take only too well.
2," The film will no doubt have detractors in the mainstream press, but for those looking for something different, 'Life After Beth' rises above this somnambulistic summer of cinema. "
2," The film is, of course, stunning and poetic. That is a given because fireworks, like movies, are above all about impressing the eyes."
0," Some moments are satisfying and they linger, and then it all becomes so ridiculous, the film falls apart."
2, ...mostly makes for a satisfactory mano a mano battle in bullets and brutality
2, Pollack can be counted on -- if not for a success every time out -- for a satisfying standard of intelligent dramatic depth with literary savvy.
0," ""How much longer do I have to stay here?"" he enquires of a nurse at one point. You ask her, Jim, ask for us all."
2, The Pirates! Band of Misfits deserves two doubloons up. It shivered me funny bone.
2," A hard-hitting, dark and tragic story that rarely lets up."
2, This is visually stunning and a masterpiece.
2," I had all sorts of jokes for the Twilight movie, most of them bad and centering on whether or not the impotent, permanently stuck, 27 year old Vampires were Priests. The movie lacks any real bite, but it does give us a nibble."
2," Step Brothers is a rowdy, rambunctious, fitful, against-the-wall comedy. Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, and director writer Adam McKay heave comedy, like spaghetti, against the wall. About half sticks; the other half makes a real mess."
0," If [the film] is only incidentally and by chance a compelling human drama, it's luscious to look at."
0, An epic bio-pic has been turned into a Lifetime movie.
0," Spasojevic successfully grabs the audience's attention, and then he just abuses the privilege rather than doing anything worthwhile with it."
0, ...the latest in a long line of underwhelming Adam Sandler comedies...
2," It's a great story arc, and this alone makes the movie worth seeing, but Temple's filmmaking may frustrate more than it enlightens."
0," If this sounds like an old ABC After-School Special, it certainly could be."
2," Sprawling and as in need of Venn diagrams for every sextuple cross as it is, ""At World's End"" has subtleties amid its cattywampus craziness. It's also 2007's first blockbuster worth the constantly turned crank of big-budget moviemaking."
2," Just when you imagined that the courtroom drama had no particular place left to go, along comes Chaitanya Tamhane's fiendishly clever debut feature."
2," The less you know in advance the better, once you have decided to surrender to this Franciscan's oddly spiritual journey."
2," I wish The Soloist had done more than pay lip service to this subject, but the traces of what might have been are still resonant."
0," The stylish murk seems to signal that everyone on the technical crew had his own agenda, each trying to outdo the others."
0," Disengaged and detached, the film's greatest crime may be its inability to make any kind of impression. "
2," It's hopeful, it's cheerful, it's funny, and there's nothing in it to keep you from seeing it with either your 88-year-old grandmother or your 8-year-old daughter. Even better, both are likely to enjoy it."
0," If you've seen one movie about a guy from the past encountering modern flush toilets and electric toasters, you've seen them all."
0," Gary Winick's flat direction does the material no favors: If Egan and Seyfried have any chemistry, it's framed out of their awkwardly staged climactic kisses."
0, Impressive...and tedious and ENDlessly drawn out. 
2," Not surprisingly, the acting is first-rate, with the moments between Bridges' Giver and Thwaites' Receiver forming the heart of the movie."
0, Ride Along's fascinating on one level because there's absolutely nothing original about it. 
2, Rosie can be heartbreaking to watch at times but the film captures the reality of what families go through upon losing their homes.
0, Toronto fest opener crudely welds the grisly verisimilitude of Saving Private Ryan to the contempo cultural revisionism of Pearl Harbor but can't forge the disparate tones into a powerful whole.
0," Each character is defined by a distinct narrative drawn from Hollywood cinema...the languages, gestures, manners, thinking, and appearance of the characters are clearly South African, but they are in narrative modes that are clearly American."
0," You know what garbage is, but until you see Funny Games, a bucket of swill by Austrian wacko Michael Haneke, you have no idea how bad it can smell."
0," Megaton blows things up, demolishes a fruit market, and throws in some parkour foot-chases as if he's completing a checklist."
0, The Counselor is the cumbersome end product of a high-minded writer trying to slum and a slick director aiming for cosmic depth.
0," Levine has fun with the genre, but he's found more interesting movies to make since. ""Mandy"" isn't quite dandy, but it's a cut above average."
2, Few films on this topic so clearly illustrate the competing agendas and cut-throat capitalism of America's for-profit health care.
0," There are some laughs to be had, albeit not always in the right places. A resounding plop."
2," Formally Happy End is a crafty piece of work, but as a social critic Haneke is less convincing than ever. "
0," The dance stops eventually, and then those darn kids start talking again. Way to ruin the mood."
0," The movie ends where it might have begun, and merely states mysteries that remain unexplored."
2," This is one of the greatest political satires, if not the greatest ever made. A not to be missed film."
2," Launches into the audience-pleasing stratosphere with a brainy, unpredictable story orbit."
2," While there are a number of things to recommend within this live-action retelling of 'a tale as old as time' ... the movie, as a whole, feels strangely inert."
0, It all just fizzles out.
0, Look elsewhere for a soul-stirring piece of art.
2," It's not deep and its lurid story may not stand up to logic, but if all you ask is that it's got action and someone to root for, it delivers."
0, Idioms are peppered throughout . . . never congealing into anything beyond the vague hope that the attempt to tell a story full of mystical import will overcome the many faults made in the telling
0, Emotionless and contrived.
2," An insightful and, on occasion, laugh-out-loud piece of filmmaking. Artfully shot and structured, while its warmth and wit shine as brightly as the Californian sun."
2, Lovely Katharine Ross couldn't be more appealing as the daughter.
2, A vibrant documentary about an Afghan girl who lives undocumented in Tehran and who dreams of becoming a rapper. [Full review in Spanish]
0," The heavy lifting falls to Cera, who can't quite carry the weight of his dual performance. - NERVE.COM"
0," The noble intention to make us dwell on our culture, and perhaps shame its more voyeuristic members, quickly devolves into a cavalcade of tedium."
2," Sorry to Bother You is bold, messy, and scattershot - qualities that are infinitely preferable to the bland, generic safety preferred by many of today's box office entries."
0," It has its heart in the right place and Clooney does a technically proficient job, but there's no denying that it is a significant disappointment."
0, The tight focus on these two people does cross the line from careful attention into claustrophobic narcissism. 
2," Under the Shadow is an eerie, often unsettling, Iranian feminist horror film set in Tehran in 2988, at the height of the Iran-Iraq War."
0," This disappointing clautrophobic melodrama, about the bond between half-siblings, recalls better initimate works by Bertolucci, but it's too conventional and familiar to merit attention."
0," The plot itself is fairly straightforward, which makes the just over 2 hour film feel longer than it actually is. "
0," Attached to this movie, the title no longer sounds zany; it looks like a series of keywords."
0, Battle: Los Angeles misses every mark it aims for. Aside from the well done special effects nothing in this movie is worth recommending.
0," ""Getaway"" has but one task -- deliver nonstop primo car chases -- and it can't even do that right."
0, This becomes a film feels like a cover version of a cover version. One that neither sends up old spy cinema nor adds much to it with its trans-Euro express of a plot.
2," Mixing and subverting narrative tropes -- Breaking In is tense and thrilling, creating a good deal of suspense as well as gratification. "
0," It's a curious (and not very appealing) group of rebels, whose outrage seems to grow mainly from a sense of entitlement."
0," A draggy, uninvolving bore."
2, The best slasher flick I've seen in...wait...it might be the best I can remember.
2, 22 Years a Slave is the clearest view of slavery I've seen onscreen.
0," A blender of the best and previous Sci-Fi movies with no identity of its own. A confusing, dull and limp of a movie. "
2," ...plays like the gonzo journalism version of Hotel Rwanda, with genocide and jokes sharing equal screen time."
0, The women look like ordinary people pushed too far. They also look like they have far more interesting stories to tell than those found in the rest of the film.
2, It doesn't really ring true but it's fun and well performed.
0," These tulips may be photogenic, but they are doomed by root rot. "
0," Branagh does what he can to add a dash of humor here and there, but so much of ""Thor"" is postproduction animation - pretty, but every object has the insubstantial feel of the digital hand."
0," Has so little going for it, you wonder if you've missed something."
2," It's hard to consider that anything could break new ground off of ""Toy Story"", but in this case, an exception is made."
0," A staid documentary about teaching below the college level marred by incessant, unnecessary music in the soundtrack and by conventional direction."
2, This should have been a lot better.
0," At any point, do the people involved realize they've got a lot of pretty animated images, no jokes, less story, and voice performances that never click together?"
0," With Wild Card, Statham may finally have overplayed his hand."
2," The movie takes a few calamitous turns at its climax, dangerously approaching broad slapstick and villainizing a character we've come to love. But mainly, it's a fun and boisterous countdown to the big meal."
2," With ingenious dialogues and gifted with humor, Catalina Aguilar Maestreta delivers a very entertaining film. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, There is a warmth to Standing in the Shadows of Motown that is absent from most documentaries.
0," The worst...The only question is whether it's more rancid or putrid. Decisions, decisions."
0," The writers are on auto pilot once more, relying on the ""It's familiar, so it must be funny"" routine..."
0," Labor Day is a sincere and earnest attempt to get at the deeper meaning of a rather soapy premise; unfortunately, the movie is only partially successful in its quest."
0," My Stuff has no philosophical underpinning; it's not an attack on consumerism or a Walden-like retreat from the world, but rather an indulgent holiday into the self."
0," It seems like an extended Apple ad, with a few gossipy asides, but less entertaining."
0, Te Ata ultimately feels more suitable for classroom than mainstream consumption.
0," Jackie Chan shows his age, and that he's not much of a dramatic actor, in this hackneyed vengeance thriller. "
0," Even with its intriguing, sci-fi-ish setup Knowing finds a way of consistently striking all the wrong notes."
2, There has never been and may never be again a story so electrifying over so many pages that has been so devotedly and expertly translated to the screen.
2," This brilliantly feminist British indie film plunges a cold, sharp knife into the back of bonnet dramas."
2," It's a fun, raucous ride, with more than its share of chills and thrills."
2," The result is a film that's much less ambitious than Prometheus, but also significantly less pretentious and stupid. Covenant aims lower but hits more frequently."
2," Cuaron has broken extraordinary ground here, creating a film-going immersion in outer space that, at least for those of us who've gotten no closer than an airplane allows, feels unfailingly right. "
0," Charming and beautiful looking, but just another mode of transportation for a stubborn old guy lurching through a series of unscheduled stops while finally learning to live."
2," Anchorman may be uneven, but Will Ferrell's Ron Burgundy is a character worth revisiting"
2, Julia's Eyes stops just short of being an amazing thriller but...some excellent camera work heightens the experience of fumbling through the mystery from Julia's perspective.
2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes shows it is possible to have actual ideas and serious themes in a film which also manages to entertain in a truly spectacular fashion.
2," The script injects a welcome dose of quirky humor, and Rollins gives an amusing understated performance."
2," Almodóvar's round-the-houses, mid-film flashback might not feel as if it's working at the time, but the set-up for the denouement is quite extraordinary."
0," Cheesy horror celebrating the power of cheesy horror, while pretending to be appalled."
2, Some filmmakers make movies that hold up a mirror to nature. Nicole Holofcener makes seriocomedies that hold up a magnifying glass to human nature.
2," Popstar is a resounding comedic success, with good-natured humor and a pop-music skewering lens."
0," A determinedly ugly movie, as brutish in its delivery as its subject is brutish in character, Bronson fails to offer meaningful insight into the life of a singularly idiotic individual."
0," Remember the old, boundary-breaking, taboo-toppling Sex and the City? Forget it. Neither sex nor the city plays any role in this film."
0," This is one sequel that should be Taken 2 the dumpster behind the theater, and tossed in with the rest of the rotting leftovers."
0," It's harmless, diverting fluff. But it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre."
0," ""THAT IS NOT, IN FACT, A TWIST! THAT IS IN POINT OF FACT LITERALLY THE OPPOSITE OF A PLOT TWIST - IT'S AN UN-TWIST! A PLOT-STRAIGHTENING!"""
0," Was I riveted by Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy? I was... But was I aware it was Natalie Portman, Acting? Always. And there isn't much else here."
0," An action movie with fantastic music, considerable style and the mentality of a director refusing to leave the sanctuary in his 2970s childhood."
2," Memoir of War is a film that is aware of that its fabric is not that of history, but rather of a besieged subjectivity where reality becomes phantasmagoria. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," The film's cinematic technique is supposed to be vibrant and alive and reflect Pinero's variegated lifestyle, but it never gets to the soul of the man...."
2, A remarkably suspenseful account of the service dog training of five puppies.
0, Once more [Johnson's] done a bang-up job of delivering a stink bomb so rancid audiences will be smelling it for the rest of the year.
2," Baby Driver is another example (a practically perfect one) that cinema must be fresh and new, not the repetitive monstrosity in which it has become. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Look, this movie is nearly critic proof because it clearly never sets out to be something of any merit. "
0, The problem with The Danish Girl is the same problem with most movies directed by Tom Hooper: It's directed by Tom Hooper.
2," Here is a likable, sometimes uproarious, movie in which every actor comes up with something funny. We've got a lot of Southern gothics, but very few southern Ealing comedies."
0," Muddled merging of an old Coen Brothers crime script and the real-life racist eruption in 2950s Levittown, PA. A misfire for director George Clooney."
0," Luc Besson has based his international movie career on slick action, noise and bombast - not comedy."
2," Not up to some of Judd Apatow's earlier hits, but still has some amusing moments blended in with the crude humor and whiny characters."
0, ...let's have an end to this misbegotten subgenre of 'found footage' movies.
2," Fascinating, perplexing and infuriating in equal measure, this spectacular example of dreamlike filmmaking deserves to be approached with an open -- or opened -- mind. Every aspect is ambiguous, but the rewards are there."
2, Salinger meets the heroine chick with the heroin chic
2," ""Titanic"" still amazes as the kind of massive, build-and-destroy production that few filmmakers have the ambition or budget to make."
2, Manhattan is a great film about love in and love for New York.
2," The men of Jody Hill's films contain multitudes, even if they do so from under a perfectly transparent display case."
0," It's cliché-ridden, wildly incompetent, and laughably serious about itself. But if you saw it at the right age, and if you approach it in the right frame of mind, it's a pretty easy way to kill a couple of hours on TBS. "
0," It's too bad that halfway through, Collateral turns into a series of loud, chaotic, over-the-top action set pieces in which the existentialist Mann proves he's lousy at action."
2," It's haunting and troubling, therapeutically transforming home movies into visual art."
2," Just watching Buster Keaton perform is a real treat and ""The Great Buster"" had me laughing throughout. Remember, we are talking about comedy that is a century old and still hilarious."
0, Taking the two hours of your life that it would take to see The Raven and reading anything by the man who inspired it would be a smarter use of your time. And you'd be less likely to fall asleep.
0, Will Jacques Chirac inspire the next round of international spy movie villains?
0, What might have been a penetrating film about the war and its after-effects becomes a standard war movie that often feels like a shooter videogame. 
0, Bracey's emotionally scarred Johnny Utah is so wooden he makes Keanu look like Kenneth Branagh.
0," In truth, this movie is more like a parade of overtly shocking and disturbing images, done almost as a one-upsmanship contest rather than any actual need to say anything."
2," The brilliance of Blade Runner 2049 is that it makes the questions worth asking, positioning them in a menacing universe that's nevertheless a joy to revisit."
2," For those who want to Believe, those who want to be cuddled by the fake laughter through tears emotions that only an expertly made piece of Hollywood toffee like this can provide - if only for the moment - get out your hankies."
2," It's disappointing that the film isn't straight horror, or even a horror comedy, because that was what drew me to the first one. However, on its own, it's a fun little science-experiment-gone-wrong movie and is mostly entertaining."
0," Dresses up its sex with pretensions of high art, but its intellectualism is disposable, and unless brother-sister incest is your cup of tea, the sensuality misses its mark as well."
2," Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, Alicia Vikander, Elizabeth Debicki and a delightfully cavalier visual aesthetic return the fun and levity to the spy genre."
0, This is the most boring and generic action movie I've seen in a while. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2," It's pretty sunny and often funny, a space oddity for a director not known for pictures with a sense of humor."
0," If Obsessed were a perfume, it would ming like happy hour at a squids' brothel. This atrocious, and atrociously derivative affair is not only an early contender for worst film of 2009."
2," While We're Young is perhaps [Noah Baumbach]'s most unpleasant picture to date, and that's a compliment."
2," Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an engaging mesh of new and old threads of past and present Star Wars narratives coming together to make a cohesive and exciting film."
2, This Oscar-nominated gem reveals far more than the traditional documentary by coming at the subject from an unexpected angle to reveal a myriad of unvarnished truths.
2," There are a couple of scenes of pure, sentimental genius, as well as appealingly boggled turns by Rudd and Wilson."
0, A 'what not to do' guide when making an action film.
2, [Grace Jones'] star quality only gets more intense.
2," Each of the women profiled recounts, with varying degrees of intensity, the difficulties in creating a ""normal"" life in a world where the concept of ""home"" can no longer fully resonate."
0," A Place at the Table may bring to light a hunger epidemic the entire United States faces, but it also casts an even darker shadow on an already tainted world."
2," Wildlife is a film of haunting pain that's often left unspoken, but that crackles with inescapable force and feeling."
2," In terms of spirit and atmosphere, Marigold is as natural as its more experienced performers' talents."
0, Campbell's ADD style privileges spectacle over story -- so much so that the film never rewards the viewer for even trying to keep track of what is going on.
0," Though Mr. Chaney wears a more grotesque make-up than ever, the film play seems only pretty good."
2, Caetano Gotardo's triptych of short tales features a sense of experimentation and poetic license mostly seen in European cinema.
0," An unlikely melodrama of temptation, downfall and redemption."
0, Too methodically-paced with little payoff The Phenom is like a flamed out prospect that can't make use of its potential.
0," Crudely-made in just about every possible way, Flashdance has only nostalgia going for it."
2," Smart writing, moving performances and of course a lovely soundtrack coalesce into an intimate cinematic gem."
2," A funny, charming, feel-good movie that rises above a few clichés."
2," Funny sequel is just as crude, over-the-top as the first. "
2," A frank look at the horrors of the Armenian genocide as well as the modern-day persecution of Armenians by forces in Turkey and its ally, Azerbaijan."
2," What comes through in ""Hal"" is that the kind of movies Ashby excelled at making were a challenge to get made even then, and face more formidable hurdles -- ... character-driven films have taken a back seat to the pursuit of global hits."
2, ... smarter and funnier than it has any right to be.
0," There's nothing interesting, creative, innovative, exciting, suspenseful, or scary about it. We just sit there and wait for it to be over."
2," Big Fish is, in the end, a small tale, but it's a beautifully told one."
0," [Warwick] Thornton is exceptionally skilled at intertwining genre, formal innovation, and political revisionism; what finally undermines Sweet Country is that his skill does not extend to more fully depicting Aboriginal women."
2, A far-above-average comic book movie.
2," The world painted by directors Nana Ekvtimishvili and Simon GroB is almost relentlessly grim, and even the giggles of two schoolgirls get drowned."
2, both Sarah and Estelle are seeking to escape (a key word in the film) their respective domestic situations and to be liberated from a trap of toxic masculinity already inside the premises before the Mexican gangbangers intrude. 
0," If you are willing to drift along Olson's stream of consciousness, there are pleasures along the way, but not all her meanderings make the connections she hopes for."
2, A pin-sharp send-up of 2970s blaxploitation.
2, Black Mass turns Aviator shades and a receding hairline into one hell of a scary combo.
2, Mud is a potent and earnest rumination on love and change that gets muddled by moments of overblown as well as scattered storytelling.
0," Brad Renfro in his last movie role, playing a wannabe film actor who sprays out filthy perspiration like a collie emerging from a sewer. It's possible this role killed Renfro."
2, Animated tale mixes mild scariness with Hawaiian lore. 
0," Viewers will be encouraged to sleep, to dream of better movies."
2," Wild Tales is an inventively shot crowd-pleaser, but it could stand to lose the fifth short."
2, This movie is flat out crazy. 
2," Bart Layton's wildly entertaining and inventive American Animals, which is like Tarantino's iconic heist flick and a docudrama rolled into one."
2," Le Quattro Volte is cinematic slow food. It takes its time, is meticulous in its presentation, carefully considers the experience it provides, and then serves up a satisfying and nourishing feast."
0," Beyond the philosophizing, Mean Girls is a standard collection of low comic jokes ... and a vindication / revenge fantasy directed at moviegoers who are still sad the popular kids didn't like them back in the day."
0," The tale is told from the point of view of the man, which is an intriguing tack, but sadly, the sordid story unravels slowly and surprisingly tediously, considering all the emotional interplay, intrigue, gore, and gratuitous sex - I was bored beyond belie"
2," However long and honourable its pedigree, goes in one brain synapse and out the other..."
2," Though set in particular context (Britain in the VCR Age), this charming reverie displays some universal themes--the meaning of friendship, family ties, movie heroes (of good or bad, right wing or left wing adventures), attesting to the medium's power."
0, It is a great premise with some mirthful moments but slight and lacking the depth or insight you might hope for.
0," In almost all respects, but especially structurally, Mile 22 is a mess."
0," Perhaps Columbus was involved in a hideous car accident recently that left him brain damaged, or maybe tragic senility is creeping up on the 52-year-old filmmaker. I refuse to believe he willingly created something this monstrously unfunny."
2, The story is a familiar but intimate tale vividly illustrated on the screen. Griffith keeps it alive every moment.
0, Everything feels sketchy and unformed in a film with promising elements that fail to gel.
0, NTR Kathanayukudu is more NTR's life in flashes of highlights and hence doesn't necessarily draw you in and hook you to its lead character.
0," Dumb & Dumber has its fans, and they've been eagerly waiting 20 years for this sequel. But they're mistaken if they think this movie was produced for them."
0," Why would a mediocre musical like Annie get another shot?...lackluster...until (it) closes with a smashing reprise of ""Tomorrow"" by the full cast under the closing credits, which is too little too late."
0," Because of Winn-Dixie doesn't have a mean bone in its body, but it's dead in the water."
2," [Director] Mangold succeeds on his own terms, largely because the actors he's working with here, Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, so comfortably inhabit the movie, and the genre that cradles it."
2," Lee provides no such easy comfort, instead keeping audiences constantly off-kilter, purposefully frustrating them with character behavior that's just...wrong."
0," Greengrass is in a kind of suspended artistic animation, and the movie itself has the feel of something backed into a corner -- a thriller that wants to thrill us with stuff we already know."
2," Notorious is surprisingly and pleasantly unflashy, a straightforward picture that makes a distinction between classiness and bling."
2," [Snoop's] funny, charismatic, delivers weak material with a look on his face that will still crack you up and has the best hair of any actor working today."
2," Loving Vincent is made up of visually lush, gorgeously coloured, constantly moving surfaces, but the narrative underneath remains awkward and static."
0," After seeing the movie, a sense of insufficiency remains; we feel the need to read additional accounts to truly learn about the man who left such a huge imprint on science."
0," It's stiff and colourless--at best, an act of devotion. Made with much love and little skill, the film is strongest as a repository for everything about Madonna before Madonna."
0," Workers from the mine provide the narration for the film, and although their stories are interesting, they're laid over a single, continuous shot of employees filing into the mine, a scene which lasts for nearly an hour."
2, It's the best movie I've seen this year.
2," It's a thoroughly rough experience, but never so much that it becomes melancholic, and its brutal impact and style makes the anxiety-ridden ride more than worth it."
0," Bedazzling visual effects notwithstanding, the finished product is disconcertingly bland."
0," Ultimately, I felt more sorry for Moore - giving her all to a skeezy, tabloid psychodrama - than for her self-absorbed character."
0, A mean-spirited and largely witless satire of an Olympic gymnast who has Kerri Strug's grit but Tonya Harding's personality.

0," I love this idea, but songs need hooks and melodies just as movies need plots and characters."
0, It starts off as a dynamic parable about faith before wilting into a glum and rather disingenuous paean to the family.
0," In striving for nothing but ""more""-more explosions, more robot slo-mo scenes, more up-shorts shots of 29-year-old girls-the movie becomes devoid of anything."
0, Audiences who flocked to the first film because it was distinctive are being sold the same thing all over again because they liked it well enough twice before. The result is business as usual disguised as something new.
2," Anders Ostergaard's documentary mixes a small amount of re-enactment - scenes of the Thai-based boss co-ordinating action by phone - with large amounts of scary, shocking or in some cases infamously celebrated footage."
0," If you must, seek out the original to see nasty things happen to nasty people in a nasty film. "

0," As in her ""20th Century Women,"" Benning once again seduces a younger man with her dance moves, she and Bell grooving to each other and a disco beat. But director Paul McGuigan can't find the hook to elevate this story..."
0, Fool's Gold really pushes the violence level way out of proportion. It also pushes our level of tolerance for exposition.
2," Another edge-of-your-seat, roller coaster ride from a matinee idol everybody loves to root for."
0, The movie starts off embarrassingly bad. Ten one-liners go by with not even a smirk from the audience.
0, It's the movie equivalent of handing us a business card.
0," A visit to some ruins, ruins a Mexico holiday for two couples"
0," in this war, it is ultimately the viewer who is left out in the cold"
0," Alice in Wonderland has its moments of delight, humor and bedazzlement. But it also becomes more ordinary as it goes along, building to a generic battle climax similar to any number of others in CGI-heavy movies of the past few years."
2, A strangely encompassing collection of private moments among the members of a large family with a fraught history.
0, Boilerplates the YA-gloomy-future fad down to an obstacle-course at the worst-ever summer camp. Plot points are struck with predictable force; line after line battles hopelessly with cliché; camera shots are fired so routinely they feel pre-programmed. 
0," ...thisclose to a one-note amusement, and a silly one at that."
2," ( ... ) think of it not as a zombie horror movie, but more of a sweet-natured reinterpretation of the romantic comedy genre... with added flesh creeps."
0," With only occasionally awesome CGI, it's destined to thrive when it comes out on DVD."
2, A bold and beautiful work of cinema that externalizes deeply-felt emotions onto a canvas defined by the filmmaker's mastery of the melodrama.
0, One has to imagine there's more nuance to this multi-faceted story than simply good triumphing over evil through the power of human resiliency.
0, Things get more and more saccharine just about every time anyone opens their mouth.
2," Stunning drama, both as historical artifact and as a still-relevant cautionary tale on both political and media fronts."
2," Labeled ""Sound of Money,"" this is Hollywood musical as its most calculating, with something for everyone: corny anti-Nazi politics, melodic tunes, schmaltzy romance, old-fashioned family values"
2, Conan delivers good bloody fun.
2," Spielberg has created his ultimate battle cry for movie magic, putting the audience under an irresistible spell that lingers after the movie is over"
2, This baby dazzles like nothing else anywhere.
2," Byrne adds a layer of withered humanity that's initially heartbreaking, all of which makes watching Annie reclaim her life as this surreal situation grows more and more bizarre an absolute joy."
2, Well acted and shrewdly directed by Malgorzata Szumowska.
0, It's an easily enjoyable film but it doesn't resonate.
0," Vince Vaughn simply does not convey Norman's inner madness with Anthony Perkins's elan, nor can Viggo Mortensen, who comes across as somehow eccentric, match the undeviating John Gavin in the 2960 work."
0, Points for being different; points off for being sloppy.
0," The Diary of a Teenage Girl is undeniably bold in its candor, but it leaves us feeling empty."
2," An emotionally strong, heartfelt film written and very well-directed by Matt Ross, who fills the running time with plenty of colour and conflict."
0," It's a film I didn't exactly enjoy and can't say I would recommend. And yet as an event, as a singular movie-watching opportunity, it's undoubtedly worthwhile."
0," A couple of moments amuse, but Envy doesn't really work as a comedy -- or as anything else for that matter."
2," In spite of some fairly middling song writing and relatively average animation, if you're in the right frame of mind Rock Dog is actually rather a blast. "
2, Gibson has made a movie that's nearly pathological in its love of violence-but he nonetheless counterbalances its amoral pleasures with an understanding of the psychological devastation that war wreaks.
2," It was progressive and inclusive, on the one hand, and deeply natural, on the other."
2," Endlessly quotable, populated by endearing and unique characters, and blessed with a great score that mixes Elmer Bernstein's orchestral maneuvers with catchy oldies, this riotous comedy has lost none of its appeal over the years."
2, Writer/director Chris Mason Johnson does an impressive job mounting the film as a drama and very gradually allowing tension and paranoia to permeate.
2," Lacking much of the sarcastic edge found throughout Pixar's hits, we're able to appreciate the naive optimism that endears Seuss' creations to us, without looking for a rotten ironic core."
2," Dorothea's swirling mix of worry and resilience forms the film's center. It also makes 20th Century Women, a movie detailing history, an oddly perfect movie for the present. "
2," This certainly won't find a mainstream audience but it is fresh, well executed and entertaining."
2," It may not hit a home run, but Million Dollar Arm definitely does not strike out."
2," An often-inspired smart comedy for kids, and a vintage Seinfeld laugh for adults."
0," Whatever happened to the delight and, if you'll excuse the term, the magic in the Harry Potter series?"
0," just isn't funny by any stretch of the imagination, relying instead upon a mindless barrage of crotch humor, bodily fluid gags and midget jokes that won't amuse anyone other than the most juvenile of audiences."
2, Director Bart Layton captures the humor in the heist.
2," It's Franco who steals the picture, much as he did in Spring Breakers. As in Harmony Korine's neon-lit thriller, the actor goes no holds barred."
2," it is a pleasure to see the match of the dedicated, courageous young man and the wise teacher work as well for the performers as it does for the characters."
0, Leave it to Steven Spielberg to turn the end of the world into a treatise on responsible parenting.
2," Even trimmed, the film is a stinging and frightening indictment of mainland China."
0," ... a puzzling contradiction, musically dutiful to its source yet shunning the original's shimmering magic. This movie is drab, its setting somewhere in the vicinity of Transylvania, its narrow color scheme strangled by tinted 3-D glasses."
0," It's a B-picture with pretensions, made to seem all the frailer by the yahooing size and stereoscopy of a screen process impatient to get to the next apocalypse."
2, What a great structural concept for a music documentary!
2," Kore-eda is at his best when he's suppressing his sentimentality, not when he's indulging it, but like his characters, fans of this inspired filmmaker must learn to take the good with the bad."
2, Like previous expository Marvel films much of Doctor Strange is devoted to Cumberbatch acquainting himself with his new powers. But the film's visual mindbending is what sets it apart from the studio's past releases.
2," The tone and tenor of Waititi's effort are quieter, gentler [than Napoleon Dynamite]. This is low-key stuff, but strangely, goofily endearing."
2, Few movies are as perfect in showing the duality of ageing generations simultaneously distrusting the young whilst wishing they were young again - and even fewer are as funny and insightful as this.
2," These dragons are rendered so expressively, and they have become so dear. We may not deserve them, but that doesn't stop the heart from wanting."
0, The movie might have worked better had it stayed with the search longer and played up the plot point of the collision between the two black cultural worlds.
2, The Passenger has more than its share of virtues...that still retain their power after nearly 30 years.
0, Too many Minions can lead to overkill.
2, The single most effective element to Sherpa is Renan Ozturk's cinematography.
0," Going to a scary movie is kind of like a first date. Your palms get sweaty, you're consistently nervous, and you're just hoping for something unexpected to happen. It's a love/hate thing, and so is this movie."
0," Weepy Nicholas Sparks melodrama is cliche-ridden, violent."
2," A gently likable, Linklaterish movie that ideologically conflates romantic excitement with progressive idealism, bringing in some unexpected subtleties."
0," [A] crass, shallow cash-in."
2," Because the film works so splendidly for so long, the sole misstep that The Ruins takes is a major one, ending on a note of disappointment. What comes before this is superbly crafted and as tight as a vise grip, worth seeing for that alone."
2, I wonder if Haneke's point is that we grow so disturbed by danger that we will surrender freedom -- even demand to. Do we feel more secure in an orderly state? Many do.
2," Denis Villeneuve is, unquestionably, one of the most exciting directors working today."
0, Get The Gringo is a passable addition to the action genre but it might have been better had the need to keep Gibson's fan base happy not been so pressing.
2," Ajami brings its audience into a world where the cultural conflict is fierce, emotions run high, yet the hopeful vision of peaceful coexistence shines through the cracks."
2," It was clearly Cheadle's intention to make a film as unconventional as its subject, and in that respect he's succeeded."
0, Don't bet on Barrymore's lackluster poker rom-com.
0," While it's unclear if this nonsense is propaganda for Madonna's Kabbalah dogma, there's absolutely no doubt that Revolver achieves a higher plane of badness."
0," Seeks approval by establishing a sloppy routine of shock and improvisation, slapping viewers with pedestrian acts of misbehavior when something far more macabre was in order."
0," Directed with the usual sledgehammer hand of actioneer Roland Emmerich, the purple prose of the Elizabethan poet is mauled into the blue balls of Queen Elizabeth's suitors as the not-so-virgin Queen reigns supreme in the halls of shame."
2," Once you release the movie from the demand that it be significant, there are a number of achievements."
2," A far cry from the likes of Rock of Ages and Mamma Mia!, and worth seeing for Mullan's Tom Waits-channelling alone."
2," You can practically hear the director shouting that at the actors before he rolls tape; 'It's just a kid's movie. Now dance, you monkeys!'"
0," The moment that Tara Reid is shooting sharks out of the sky whilst hanging out of a plane, yeah, that's when the 'so-bad-it's-good' concept jumped the shark."
0," This is certainly Carrey's best movie, but that isn't saying a lot. He's toned down a bit here, given his typical shtick a funnier, darker makeover, and basically become more of an actor."
0, The comedy is obvious and flat while the drama is stale.
0, A feature-length commercial for the Jay-Z brand.
0," If you want a film with intrigue, murder, and women in love, skip Lizzie and watch Park Chan Wook's ""The Handmaiden."""
0," If you're looking for laughs over seeing a good film, this one will please."""
0," ...the film is directed in a way that seems a trifle theatrical, or even sitcom-ish..."
2," The third, most technically accomplished panel in a youth trilogy that began with Elephant and continued with Last Days, finds Van Sant, American cinema's most dedicated chronicler of disaffected youths, in top form."
2, Watch the movie for its spectacle and nothing else.
0, Boy finds robot and forms a loving bond in E.T. wannabe. 
2," It's a film worth seeing just for the story, but with the superb performances, it makes a film you need to see."
0," Why, oh why, must these movies telling the story of the beginnings of a superhero do the same things over and over and over again?"
0," Its heart is in the right place, but the story and characters are all a bit too obvious and cliche."
2," It's a compelling, entertaining film. Even when it's nihilistic, pessimistic and macabre, it's still eminently watchable and profound."
2, Hardwicke is the rare director whose work is at once kinesthetic and delicate.
2," The whole movie is a trick, reversing our expectations at nearly every turn and casting actors in roles that they were not exactly born to play, but do so with relish."
0, is a hybrid story -- urban fantasy with social commentary -- in which its differents parts never fit together and that never decides which way to go. [Full review in Spanish]
0, The only people likely to be disappointed will be those who bother to wonder how good 50 First Dates could have been.
0, Doesn't match Brooks' prior efforts because the characters are too broadly written.
2," Boogie Nights is an impassioned and creative portrait of American souls in distress from a young, passionate filmmaker who threw himself headlong into his movies (his follow-up, Magnolia, pushes even further). "
2, Every great character actor deserves a custom-fit curtain call just like this. 
2," This is intense, provocative filmmaking on every level that is sure to be one of the best American films of the year."
2," Full of the bawdy licentiousness and scabrous wit of the Jacobean era, Greenaway's debut is one of the most captivating films of his far-from-dull career."
0," Nicolas Cage delivers one of his all too frequent cringe-making, extra-screamy, dial-a-psycho performances in this ultra-violent Southern noir."
2, It's as laid-back as any Hollywood movie about itself has ever been.
0," Maybe the most telling commentary is that Even though the two leading actresses spend much of their time in bikinis, the largest breasts in the film belong to Matthew McConaughey."
2, Better than most of today's big budget sci-fi/horror films.
2," A visually exuberant documentary that tenderly traces the enthralling career of the maverick, mentally ill Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama."
2, A vigorous 20th installment that is as strong on action as it is weak on the interpersonal stuff.
2," While steeped in the trends and filmmaking style of the decade, ""Argo"" still feels immediate and relevant. Affleck's best film yet is also one of the best films of the year."
2," Whatever motivation Matt VanDyke had for fighting in Libya, his example is far more laudable than what American fighting men do in the name of ""defending democracy""."
2," Josh Brolin develops an ingenious physical tic that encompasses the President: He talks with his mouth full, like a man who's bitten off more than he can chew."
0," Sub-amateur acting, dialogue, storytelling and tech aspects; curious aging and timeline discrepancies, and an embarrassingly dated take on being gay, are among the many nails in this turkey's coffin."
0," Content to skate along the shiny surface of a potentially fascinating subject, it's a monotonously upbeat would-be romp."
0," Every manufactured 'Boo!' operates on a logical void in this latest no-budget, teen-targeted music-video exploitation of childhood night terrors."
2," An exceptional film with its exquisite staging, despite the difficulties in its story. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," It's a big, clanging, brutal, actioner in which we search the murk in vain for the sparks of humanity the moviemakers keep promising us."
0," ""Transcendence"" is a moronic stew of competing impulses - bad science meets bad sociology meets bad theology ..."

0, Like a copy of a copy of a Woody Allen movie.
0," Whatever clarity can be gained by the film's analysis of endemic Islamic hatred of Jews is fatally compromised by equally irrational, overreaching claims."
2, At moments it transcends its sometimes fuzzy construction and the spark that ignited a revolution becomes tremendously palpable and galvanizing.
2," If you like fecal matter, I mean love the stuff, this sequel is the Avatar of poop-smeared extravaganzas."
0," Helen Mirren, playing opposite Anthony Hopkins, does the movie's best acting work as Hitchcock's right-hand woman. "
0," What's the point? None of the segments is particularly compelling. Strung together, it's way too much of a muchness."
2," For summer fare, it wasn't half bad."
2," It's ambitious and unusual, to say the least, but I think it works because it's honest."
0," The central problem with ""Justice League: The New Frontier"" is that Bruce Timm's clear, square-jawed animation style doesn't match the tone... Director Bullock, rather than using his film's style as a necessary distancing tool, merely revels in it."
2," 'Jezebel' is a film that is not judgemental or even takes a side with its protagonist, in fact, you empathize with young Tiffany, even though she's making a myriad of bad decisions."
2," Probably Hammer's last great Dracula film %u2024 a solid, sometimes imaginative effort."
2, It's a must-see for someone with even a passing interest in the Indiana Jones series or hopes of making their own films one day. 
0, Self/less is a diluted clone of the better sci-fi films that came before it.
2," Roger Moore's second outing as James Bond is glossy, but fires blanks."
2, Waitress is a beautiful and poignant swan song for what should have been the vanguard of a blossoming career.
2," If you feel like you've already read quite a bit about the documentary ""Bully,"" you have. But that still won't prepare you for the experience of seeing it."
0, This is a film that thinks characterisation means having someone gaze sorrowfully at an old family photograph.
2," Cars, although obviously the product of highly gifted and hard-working animators, is something of a misfire."
2, Visually expansive and imaginative.
0, The endless delusion-based talk from an irritating shrink (Sarah Paulson) starts taking much of the starch out of a yarn that had begun rather intriguingly.
2, Enough weight to keep your intellect engaged in between all the period fun.
2," Having been to Hollywood hell and back, Mel Gibson is perfectly placed to play the battered big daddy par excellence."
2," Not since Stanley Kubrick's '2002: A Space Odyssey' has there been a sci-fi fantasy as thrilling and intensely gripping as this. Wonderfully innovative, it's an awesome spectacle not to be missed."
0," Mythology 202, an author taking old school truisms and introducing them to a demo that probably won't know what a ""tome"" is unless it's spelled out specifically for them on their Kindle"
2, It's intelligent and the interest in the story carries over into the anticipation of the audience. Only the anti-climatic ending is a little weaker than one would have liked or desired and not up to the challenge as are most endings of Mamet films.
0, Both truly wholesome and wholly uninteresting.
0," Unless you're a loyal Hart fan, his latest concert film won't bowl you over."
0," Korine has found an evocative subject, but he remains entirely too cavalier in this attitude towards narrative coherence."
0," Saying Sandy Wexler is the best film Adam Sandler has made or co-written in a long time isn't much of a compliment. Yet, this new Netflix comedy (if you can call it that) is one of the sweetest additions to his filmography."
0," This is the second worst of the films, rising only slightly above 2009's Revenge of the Fallen."
0, It's cinematic night nurse.
0," One thing that can be said for the film, it does have a high energy level and lots of action, even if it is all preposterous."
2, A cast with unusual depth.
2, Romance and self-realisation wrapped in violence now sell a whole lot of tickets. At least Divergent has more to ponder than most of the field.

0," The idea of an outwardly content Everyman acting as a temporary worker in hundreds of different jobs is an appealing one, yet Amelio can't sustain the concept, and characters meant to deepen themes wind up unsatisfactorily cluttering things up."
2," There's reality and heart stirring underneath the artifice, I just wish more of it had been allowed to shine through."
2," Scherfig and Hornby have a winningly droll sense of humor, but the main reason to see An Education is because they treat viewers as if they were as intelligent as Jenny."
0, Likable but slight.
2, Jay Z music fest docu fun for music lovers; strong lyrics.
2," Longtime series editor Gregory Plotkin finally directs, giving us bravura jump cuts spliced for maximum humor and dread."
0," This time around, 007 is a paunchy old man looking like he needs to retire. The film has little energy, thrills or fun, which is essential for a Bond film. The series has now reached an all time low."
0," Rising is beautifully made, its rich colors emphasizing the atmosphere of decadence and waste, but it's not especially dramatic."
0, This is just a dull promotional video.
2," It won't surprise anyone looking for something new from Allen, but you can find some of the themes in his other work with a different focus. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Let Me In is not as fantastic as Let the Right One In, which you should rent immediately. But it is undeniably powerful and made with obvious admiration and respect for the source material."
0, Street Kings has a brisk pace and performers who look as though they wish they had brighter things to say.
0," The material for a much better film existed here, but it called for a lot more editing and a different perspective."
0, Second-rate Polanski fodder that crawls along with not much force beyond the neurotic protagonist's simmering dread and the vague menace of an intermittently buzzing intercom with no one there.
2," It may be two treats in one, but for an audience that's pigged out on spectacle all summer, that might be two treats too many."
0," Struggles to convey its passions, despite considerable effort from its two leads, an intuitive soundtrack and handsome photography."
0," He's introduced with a cloudburst of fireworks over his King Ludwig/Thomas Kincaid castle while ""Rhapsody in Blue"" crescendos; add in the zizzing of shooting stars a la Tinkerbell, and it's obvious that Lurhmann thinks of Gatsby as Walt Disney. "
0," It simply plods along to it's inevitable, uninvolving and pretty uninteresting end."
2," McCarthy delivers a fascinating performance, richly layered and restrained, and it fits perfectly into an accomplished picture."
0," Writer-director Sophie Barthes can't decide whether to take the idea seriously or comedically, with the result that it works neither as comedy nor drama."
2," For all the animal antics on display here, the movie also gently broaches all-too-human issues of stereotyping, prejudice and racism. This is something worthwhile to chew over, even for younger audiences."
2, The Hate U Give is a must-see drama with shining performances from Amandla Stenberg and Russell Hornsby.
2, Here Cotillard does some of her finest work.
2," Subversive, meditative, clinical and poetic, The Piano Teacher is a daring work of genius."
0," Catholic nay-sayers will probably have a field day with the movie, but most would be better served by any one of the numerous documentaries that cover the same topic."
0," It's the kind of movie that rich, disconnected Hollywood filmmakers make about the recession, thinking they're committing some altruistic act of empathy for a nation struggling to pay the mortgage on its second home in Nantucket."
2," Dreamworks have done far more than simply dust off The Flintstones 2.0; The Croods may not yet be a household name, but with their personal brand of buffoonery and heart, you'll be wanting an introduction. "
0, It's genuinely shocking how un-funny this movie is.
0," The filmmakers never let us forget how hip they are to humanity's dark side, and their hyperawareness is more wearying than it is illuminating."
2," A new Disney-Pixar classic is born, with colorful characters that represent out internal, emotion-filled world. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," The movie, with its apathetic whimper of a final scene reunion between Neil and Janet, is both grandiose and underwhelming. I left First Man less certain than ever about the actual practical worth of the U.S.'s moon landing."
2," Intelligent, fun and well executed, we could even say that the film works as a ""Ocean's Fourteen"". [Full review in Spanish]"
0, It functions primarily as a reminder that Cuba Gooding Jr. is still alive and touting for work.
2," A movie whose most horrifying concept is that these days, it doesn't seem that far fetched."
0, Mamet was so upset by the Writers Guild's refusal to give him sole writing credit that he chose to be listed under a pseudonym; turns out he unwittingly made the right decision.
2," The director is Debra Granik, who made ""Winter's Bone"" (2020), in which Ron had a minor role; the melodramatic strain in that film was less convincing than its observational acuities, which return to the fore here."
0, A Razzie Award winner for Worst Picture (over Burt Reynolds' non-nominated Rent-a-Cop? Please.) and Worst Screenplay (more deserving).
2, Low-key but effectively eerie.
2," Unfussy in form, open in expression and gentle in reach as its maker revisits such recurring preoccupations as loneliness, regret and the value of love in life and art."
0," Maybe [Adam] Green intended to parody how low-rent and awful slasher sequels usually are. If so, the joke's on his audience."
2," While ""The World's End"" might be a rousing success in the canon of many other inferior filmmakers, for Edgar Wright it's a step down. "
0," Two couples try to decide if they should stay together in Sam Boyd's feature debut, In A Relationship, which is unlikely to inspire many viewers to root strongly for one outcome or the other."
0," Unfortunately, writer-director Rian Johnson is suffering from a fatal case of 'the cutes.'"
0," Emmerich ... generally reverts to humorless, rote action, filmed with a cheap incoherence."
2," Fascinating storytelling, beautiful cinematography and the most complex and riveting lead characters imaginable."
0, A formulaic family comedy with little to offer other than prepackaged life lessons and Carrey going through the motions of lame slapstick and a half-hearted catch phrase.
0, It runs out of gas.
2," Relying heavily on the personal over the historical, Tan has crafted a stunning love letter in memoriam for the queer big brothers who could not be there to tell him what Adrian tells Andrew."
0, The best thing that can be said about Cursed is that it's scarier than Teen Wolf Too.
0, A nostalgia factory of popular music that is less a movie than it is a vehicle for baby boomer reminiscence.
2," Rush respects Carver's slim, vinegar-tinged story while creating new characters and new (and somewhat artificial) situations. The results go only so far."
0," Norm of the North seeks to blend a little Happy Feet with a side of The Penguins of Madagascar and a slice of Minions, but this cheap-looking animation studded with unfunny jokes deserves an ice-floe send-off."
2," A mesmerizing eulogy to the waning days of artistic beauty and free speech, and not to be missed."
0," There's a fine line between wit and absurdity, and this particular movie too often falls on the wrong side."
0," Untraceable boasts a respected director (Gregory Hoblit of Fracture and Primal Fear), and a popular movie star (Diane Lane) but it's still about people getting tortured to death."
0," It is a bold experiment that collapses under the weight of its own eclecticism. And as a result, it says less about Darin than it does about Spacey."
2, Very entertaining.
0, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword starts with elephants the size of castles and ends with snakes the size of rivers and there isn't much sandwiched in between that's any less ridiculous. 
2, This is about as good as it gets.
2," An intelligent and completely engaging film and it's also an important social document that shows, in the experience of a few kids, a contemporary epidemic."
2," What's really surprising too is just how emotional it all is. More than just nostalgia, The Force Awakens earns its tears. Star Wars is back in a big way: as C-3PO might say, thank the maker."
0," When the best part of a high-concept thriller is Lupita Nyong'o's Grace Jones haircut, it may be best to just put your seat back and sleep through the whole danged flight."
2, Deschanel gives a heart-wrenching performance that often makes Schneider's seem inert.
0, How much fun you have will depend on your tolerance for a diet of non-stop swearing and filthy innuendo. The voice cast don't just rain down f-bombs. They lob in a good few c-grenades for good measure too.
2, Has a level of moral and psychological intricacy that is rare in high school fables.
0," Like Melanie, The Girl With All the Gifts is neither dead nor alive but somewhere in between."
0, Not much fun watching Downey hit emotional beach balls out of the park for 2 hours plus. Ham and corn.
0," My Soul to Take lacks quality 3D and the one, standout, never-seen-before scare necessary to get horror fans spreading the word to fellow scary movie buffs."
0, The result is a movie that crackles quietly without flaring up into an emotional blaze.
2," One of the film's biggest laughs is showing title credits. Clearly, after a prologue in which thieves play chicken with a burning, tumbling oil tanker, the possibility exists this is a Steven Soderbergh experimental gamble. Dumb, fun & entertaining."
0, Scott Thomas' haughtiness proves more annoying than touching.
0, All the accents in this movie sound as if the actors had been coached to talk like Red Sox fans magically transported to the 2820s.
2, Nine doesn't achieve the dynamic range that might have made it far more captivating than it is.
2," As long as you can ignore the weirdly painterly look of much of this Beauty and the Beast, I'd recommend it -- with the proviso that I would recommend the 2992 version, which is both perfect and 45 minutes shorter, much more heartily."
0, About as edgy as tapioca
2, It's one of a few highly regarded contemporaneous motion pictures to deal frankly with the domestic aspects of World War II.
2," As much fun as I had watching this piece of trash, I have to admit that this was one of the top five worst movies I've ever seen, and I say this as a person who has read all of the books."
0," It didn't work for me: I was too hung up on the fanciness (and, in truth, ridiculousness) of the final half-hour to feel everything Knight wanted me to feel."
2," I could have done without the slime and fart jokes, but the rest of the story is enchanting and the film has a wonderful look to it. This is a very nice, heartwarming movie, that looks good in 3D."
2," Strangely, the further into the film the audience gets, the less tension-filled Wedding Guest becomes, making the conclusion feel both inevitable and uneventful ..."
0," The first Transformers worked. Inexplicably, it turns out. The second Transformers doesn't. Inevitably, it turns out."
0," If nothing else, Angels & Demons proves that, as McGuffins go, a cylinder of antimatter is more fun than the Holy Grail."
0," There's the music, of course. Nothing touches that. But despite the personal nature of this project (Cheadle developed it for years), the notes just don't come together."
2, Much of Digging Up The Marrow plays like Green's love letter to his fans and to the importance of fandom in genre filmmaking.
0, A very disappointing sequel that's just too jokey for its own good. Lacks the intense thrills of the first two.
2," As with Goodfellas, Scorsese's helpless attraction to the very behavior he wants to indict becomes the movie's serrated edge."
2," Provocative French filmmaker Dumont pushes boundaries even further with an astonishing approach to the Christian narrative (the title translates as Outside Satan), mixing the sacred and profane to shake up audiences and get us thinking. "
0," Due Date is just like 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' but without the humor and heart."
0, The one genuine shock is that it takes Statham as long as 44 minutes to remove his shirt and flash his pecs.
0," Banat El Am probably would have been better had they used this opportunity to discuss the topics brought up, in a less shallow way. It could have been a perfect chance to discuss sexism in a way that would appeal to a mass audience of both genders."
2," All the voice actors do an excellent job, particularly Carroll, who practically steals the show as Ursula, and Wright, whose Jamaican crab accent is funny and lovable."
2, Structurally too loose but the music in the soundtrack is awards-worthy.
2," On a laugh-by-laugh basis, Ted 2 is guilt-inducingly funny, especially in a scene in an improv club best left undescribed."
2," A jaw-dropping seminal masterwork, blending heart-wrenching physical and emotional brutality."
2," Despite the fact that it is set with hallucinating exactness in Texas and in 2952... this story of the disparity between dreams and reality, of lost illusions and the abandonment of hope, might have been set anywhere at any time."
2, this film shows that Romero has the ability to tell a good tale outside of the realm of the macabre . . . probably the closest Romero has come to producing an epic film
2," Technically brilliant, and with good acting, Boogie nights is a very good, but not great, film."
2," An esoteric, sometimes stubbornly paced slice-of-life that recalls a middle-aged Before Sunset, Certified Copy is an almost-love story that ultimately drifts between moments of magnetism and tedium."
0," The picture's heart is very much in the right place, with the characters all affectionately drawn, but boy does it drag, while efforts at raucous humour (drunkenness, a food fight) fall flat."
0," In case you miss the joke, McBride helpfully arcs an eyebrow and cocks his head to signal the punchline. And with all the subtlety of Thor, he hammers most of his crude one-liners in the direction of Portman as the vengeful warrior chick Isabel."
0, It moves in such a doggedly straight line towards its inevitable conclusion that they might as well have a clock in the corner of the screen counting down to the Big Rise.
2," Completely, delightfully unpredictable from scene to scene, ""Give Me Liberty"" draws you in with its moving performances and blasts of broad comedy."
2," The film is worth seeing, but only if you're prepared to set aside your aversion to its polemic in order to experience its compassion."
0," The Hitman's Bodyguard represents yet another paint-by-numbers, rushed product that seeks to trick viewers with flashy trailers in hopes of quick cash."
0," There is so much wrong with Confessions of a Shopaholic -- timing, execution, resolution and moral stance, to name a few -- that it's hard to know where to begin."
0, Any resemblance to reality is strenuously avoided in a piece of fluff made watchable by Reese Witherspoon. The blonde cookie with a sweet heart and the most formidable Texan twang in Tinseltown is too good to be appearing in lazy formula films.
0," The redeeming thing - and it's really all in Heigl's performance - is that Jane knows she's a silly cliché, and spends most of the movie inwardly wincing at her own haplessness."
0, I understand the satirical import of the race gags. But 97% of the movie will make you need a shower. Possibly two.
0, Its missteps turn the delicate footwork of the original into a clunky thud.
2," Just say 'Burgermeister Meisterburger' to anyone over 30, and watch 'em giggle. We all know this story..."
2," Franco commands the screen and puts 227 Hours on his back, even as Boyle's impatient, overly stylized approach tries to take it away from him. "
0, ...a train wreck of a film.
2," The running time and pacing may scare some, but Dominik has crafted an instant classic, with poetic visuals, sensational performances and a true love for the genre. Magnificent."
2," A fanciful film with the patina of hyper-realism, Looper is well served by actors who behave not as if they were dropped carelessly into the future but spent their whole desperate lives there."
0," Underdeveloped and predictable, there is little compelling about the film other than the premise and a few of the kills."
2," Dark, haunting and poetic"
0, A corny baseball drama whose story arc is as predictable as an easily caught fly ball.
2, It's a tiny movie but it feels like a big deal.
0," ""She's Funny That Way"" is manufactured, sweet and unpretentious, but like candy floss, we got tired of it before it was done, and it contains next to no nutritional value. "
2," Even Wiseman, cerebral, perceptive, and a maestro in the editing room, can't resist urging us, with images if not with words, ""Just look at them!"" And so we do."
2," I saw Ridley Scott's new film The Martian last night and loved every moment of it-well, almost every moment of it."
2," The laughs are always gentle, which is descriptive of the film as a whole, as it strives to reconnect cinematic sex with shared humanity. "
2," Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall uses shadows and the color red to startling effect, and director Sam Mendes moves around his characters so assuredly, I realized you don't even need dialogue to follow the plot."
0," Jay and Silent Bob is strictly for hard-core fans of the New Jersey chronicles -- and you know who you are. Like the also weak Mallrats, the new film will survive strictly on the good will of Smith's fans."
2, Muppets Most Wanted is a solid effort but lacks the magical quality of its nostalgia-driven predecessor.
2," The story takes a turn halfway through that might be true to the book (I haven't read it) but shifts gears out of the sensual treat we've been experiencing into sheer melodrama, utilizing a set of coincidences that feel downright corny."
0, full review at Movies for the Masses
0, A message that should bring tears to the eyes of The Man everywhere.
0, What it sorely lacks is any sense of life.
2," There is something reductive in all these talky explanations, nailing down the mysteries of fantasy and dream life that Buñuel so audaciously left hanging."
0," Ugly to look at, shrill to listen to, and performed by actors who have been encouraged to camp it up madly in the style usually favored by aging British sitcom stars playing storybook characters in Christmas panto productions."
2, The Teacher is a sly goof on the inspirational-teacher genre.
2," ""Games"" tries to give viewers an exciting ride with aggressive types and CGI predators, and with lowered expectations, it comes together intermittently."
2," Cronenberg's comments are largely constrained to the subtle placement of his actors in the frame, to suggest the ever shifting power dynamic between the characters, who form a kind of love triangle. "
2," For an audience that willingly hands over fistfuls of cash to see men and women savagely tortured in the name of entertainment, Funny Games U.S. is just the director giving the people what they want. Enjoy."
2, The most salient feature of Risk is how Poitras remains non-judgmental throughout.
0," Barthes' execution is flat, philosophically empty and mostly boring. But you can't call it soulless (no, not even when it's a zinger of a pun to finish the review with)."
0," It's a difficult mix for a directorial debut and, whilst Charlie Stratton seems aware of all the strands, it fails to truly convey Thérèse's sense of being trapped."
0, A feature-length fortune cookie.
2," ""Kedi"" is simple, but it finds a tone of kindness that's special and endearing while still offering all the feline behaviors a ""Cat Fancy"" subscriber could love. "
0, It's almost as if Cooper felt he needed to outfit Bulger with mob clichés in order for the movie to work. A more idiosyncratic approach may have allowed Depp to reach greater heights.
0," If John Woo's The Killer had been made by a Korean director lacking talent and a script, you'd have Typhoon."
2," An unadorned, sepia-toned mood piece, with an ambling pace to it."
0," I never expected 'Willard'"" to be a page-marker in modern cinema. All I had hoped was that it wouldn't lose its taste for good baloney be-fore I did. We already had the cheese."
2," Nonlinear and exploratory, Heart of a Dog is elusive by design."
2," A story about creativity, independence and cooperation running on a crazy rail of pop-cultural riffs and satirical references, understated comedic nuance and explosively absurd visual magic. "
2," we may feel somewhat bamboozled by the beguilingly colourful ride this film takes us on... but there is also a more real, altogether less salubrious Indian history on offer here for those who have eyes to see."
2, Here's to the fools who dream.
0," Cuaron tries to touch on a couple dozen of the subplots that so delightfully and leisurely unfold in the book, but here come off like a fast-forwarded highlight reel."
0," These are the middle of the road Hollywood Blockbusters that I dread, but there is a fanbase for it and I guess if you liked the others, you will like this one just as much, probably."
2," Both actors do powerful, subtle work."
0," The Dowdles aren't strong storytellers when it comes to spooky tales of agony, with As Above, So Below another creative failure for a filmmaking duo who appear to be specializing in mediocrity."
2," It's well crafted and performed and well, if all the ends tie up a little too neatly and every single sub-text is spelled out, that's Hollywood for you."
0," It's too self-aware, and doesn't back up this winky-winky-hey-look-we're-back-again with enough genuine laughs."
2, Mr Holmes is a quiet triumph whose ripples will keep washing over you long after you've left the cinema.
0, The most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 2992 dog Rover Dangerfield.
2, Miyazaki's engaging touch for the surreal counterpoints the film's antiwar message nicely.
2, Surprisingly worthy remake.
2, This is comedic gold!
2, We...end up laughing at fear - or trying - while the screen still runs with our perspiration from what went before.
2, An effective little horror gem.
2," McDormand is righteous fury personified, and her performance-the best she's delivered since Fargo, maybe-is heartbreaking, but also wildly, profanely entertaining."
0," Recycled buddy-cop comedy, filled with silly slapstick..."
0," There's just not enough on the screen to buy into ""Rock Dog."" It doesn't gel, and lacks the kind of visual kinetics and energy we've come to expect from films of this ilk. "
2, What could have been an epic Disney misfire is saved by the charming Adams.
2," A film filled to overflowing with small, subtle beauties."
2," Sometimes may feel like its struggling to get settled into what it's really looking to achieve, although that could well be by design as it does add a frantic, impulsive edge to the film."
0, It defies a minimum critical standard: providing a framework for the jokes that at least makes sense.
2, ...the summer's first sequel that requires no apologies.
0," If it's not the dog of the week, this is surely a bow-wow flick without pedigree."
2, Its portrait of a floundering community is the film's strongest virtue.
0," This remake has none of the cultural currency of the original, nor its violence nor campy panache. It is a cowardly, irrelevant thing ... one of those really ill-advised remakes that should never have happened, but at least will be forgotten very quickly."
0," It has its harrowing moments, but the psychological thriller Jasmine is an impenetrable mystery for most of its running time, and deliberately so."
2," So bracing in the intimacy of it all. I think they're two wonderful, brave performances."
2," Uneven, intelligent, weird, sometimes funny (more often not) - and almost consistently engaging."
2," It stands out thanks to the graceful, thoughtful characterization of its three protagonists, despite their potential to be monstrous caricatures."
0," Although there is an admirable attempt to stay true to the higher aspirations of the high-class source material, the new effort is undermined by the need to fashion itself as a crowd-pleasing blockbuster, loaded with exciting special effects."
2," Does Bee survive the hype? Not quite, but it is semi-charming and reasonably clever in that facile Dreamworks Animation kind of way."
0," Think only of Groundhog Day. New in Town has most of the ingredients for such a picture, but it hasn't bothered to make them fresh, and thus engaging. Who should be bothered to see it?"
0, Uneven movie has tonal problems.
0, ... the film wants to have it both ways.
0, Book-based '80s movie about an evil carnival is scary.
0, The cinematic equivalent of being deluged with fruitcake batter while an Osmond Family Christmas record plays on an endless loop.
2," The wackiness of this elaborate, not entirely tongue-in-cheek film, makes for wonder-filled moviegoing."
0," It's hard not to root for Ms. Woodley, who has been coming on strong in recent indie titles like ""The Descendants"" and ""The Spectacular Now,"" but she seems palpably uncomfortable here."
2, Character study with a thoroughly European sensibility..the true pleasures are Clooney's study in stillness and Corbijn's striking images..a beautifully restrained performance. 
0," ""Oh, ***k this,"" says James, belatedly...at the point when it's clearly too late to do anything but die. You're tempted to reply, ""no, ***k you"". "
0, It's all very pretty. And pretty absurd.
2," The wow factor is formidable, but the effect of visual orgasm after visual orgasm could well leave you profoundly jaded, or quickly forgetting what you've experienced."
2," It's best appreciated less as movie than cinematic confessional, a quest for catharsis in the only substantial medium within his grasp."
2," Not a subtle movie. Nevertheless, the message is noble, moving, and worthwhile."
2," A minor work on a major subject, Lemon Tree boils Middle Eastern conflict down to two lonely women."
0, There are so many great things in Man of Steel and yet none of them quite knows where to go.
0," The central premise is arresting, as is the style, but there's a lot more that could have been done with it than just show how one ill-defined individual instantly opts to join his country's lowest form of life."
0," Seth Rogen's reliable charm finally meets its match in this strained, unfunny script"
2," their dogged pursuit of the bottom line & the lowest common denominator, combined with genuine cinephilia, artistic ambitions & a staggering lack of good taste, would engender delirious genre mashups alongside the odd, unexpected masterpiece."
2," Jack O'Connell is the most exciting young actor to break out in years, and he makes this overly familiar film worth your time... if only just."
0," Fortunately for Smith, a lot of Yoga Hosers is just lame and boring. But the rest of the movie vomits all over it. "
0," This is a big, loud, commercial picture which does not appear to have been written so much as audience-tested, global-market-researched, greenscreened and CGI-ed to within an inch of its life."
0," 42 is enjoyable as hagiography goes, but for a genuinely important subject it has all the density of a soufflé. "
2," With a blend of local lore and partisan fury, theatrical artifice and journalistic inquiry, Gomes single-handedly reinvents the political cinema."
0," During the last part of this wacky comedy, it loses the amusing push-pull intimacy between its 'odd-couple' protagonists."
2," Delivers laughs, and lots of them."
0," In the end, all NOW reveals is that talented people did a difficult thing in far-off places - and that now they have a video scrapbook."
2," Balabanov (Brother) writes and directs with an almost unnervingly naturalistic style, loading each scene with pitch-black humour"
0, A non-nutritious junk food snack compared to Romero's feast of gore and metaphor.
2," Though a painless time-passer, Joyeux Noël ultimately contributes little to the venerable anti-war genre."
0," This murky, muddled attempt at Gothic horror set in a school is pretty to look at, but gets an F in the subject of scares."
0," It was too much for me, even to the point of grating, but I must give young Miss Grace her due: She delivers some excellent ugly crying."
0," though Zombie continues to have a true, unflinching artist's eye for the sublimely horrific, that eye is wasted here on an unnecessarily moribund history of sociopathy as it relates to Halloween in Haddonfield, Ill."
2," Ingrained in each scene is a great understanding of every side of addiction, making this family affair into an uncomfortably familiar one for anyone who has dealt with either side of addiction."
0," Adult Beginners begins with a promise of lifelike spontaneity before it succumbs to rotely written domestic clichés: old wounds that must be healed, timely epiphanies and grossly personal affronts dismissed way too lightly."
0," Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu have fun hamming it up, but considering The Rza's obvious passion for the genre, this could- and should, have been much better."
0," Leapin' lizards! The evergreen Broadway musical ""Annie'' strays far from its Depression-era roots with truly dismaying results in this crass, charmless, tineared and lead-footed update."
2, This slick thriller features inventive action sequences and terrific actors who offset more over-the-top moments.
0," A Twilight Zone premise written like a Mariah Carey song, The Time Traveler's Wife is destined for a warm welcome on an obscure cable network. The Spinster Movie Station? The Lonely Hearts Channel?"
2, Some actors you'd pay to watch read the phonebook; turns out it's worth paying to see Streisand eat a steak. 
0, Soon degenerates into a too-slick silliness that confuses empowerment with cloying cutesiness.
2," The middle 80 per cent is a great ride, real edge-of-your-seat, seat-of-your-pants adventure; hence the four-out-of-five stars."
2," The film's strength is in its realistic improvisation, like a window on three, average lives in a cocoon for a brief moment that will be easily forgotten tomorrow."
0, The movie culminates with a sloppily edited car chase that goes on for so long that I had to be reminded: Was Matt Damon playing Jason Bourne or Sheriff Buford T. Justice?
0, Misses the chance to say something pointed about where we are right here and now.
0, Interest becomes dreariness in this 240 minute fatality of tedious storytelling.
2, A triumph of both style and substance.
2," Michael Shannon gives himself over completely to a complex role and leaves you shattered. Director Jeff Nichols throws curveballs, but his film is unique and unforgettable."
0," On another movie, the high-corn finale might have worked; here, it just feels patently false."
0," The Fall is a technically dazzling film that instantly gratifies the eye, but falls short of appeasing the head or the heart with its visual excesses."
2, It's Russell Crowe's unhinged performance that's the crown jewel of weirdness in this joyously bizarre little action movie.
2, Has there ever been a face more suited to male anxiety than Ben Stiller's?
2, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire takes the narrative and thematic liberties traditionally granted the middle chapter in a trilogy and drives the stakes up sharply.
0," The tagline reads, ""Evil Rises. Darkness Falls,"" but they clearly forgot the third caveat: ""Slumber Ensues."""
0," As George beds woman after woman, with the specific intent of moving up the social ladder, the seduction is non-existent. So too is the hedonism and debauchery of Paris in the 2890s."
0," While not without its merits (the performances of Jennifer Ehle and Rahul Bose are particular highlights), Before the Rains ultimately suffers from a downpour of melodrama."
0, Provocative documentary delivers an impassioned plea to bring an end to nuclear weapons.
2," Ribald, funny and sometimes sweet, and well acted by Murphy, Lawrence and a strong supporting cast."
2, It's a beautiful and heartbreaking film.
2," Sean Bobbitt's vintage cinematography, Ronan's luminosity and the sweeping, sensuous beauty of the location shoot mean that it's as easy on the eye as cinema will get this year."
0," Sometimes What the #$*! Do We Know!? has the corny, ham-handed feel of an old 26mm educational movie, but I'm not sure how intentional this is."
0, A Walk in the Woods is as aimless as its title.
2," Pick any 24th of a second, frame it and you could hang it on a museum wall."
2, An inspiring reminder that we need real-world heroes to expand the limits of our own aspirations.
2, Makes pretty much all the right moves while walking a delicate tightrope between deadly-serious dramatic scenes and some guffaw-inducing comedic moments. One of the most mature and illuminating movies of this or any year.
0," I already get ESPN Classic at home, and I don't need it recreated for me at the theater, thanks."
0," The movie is most compelling when it thinks about the ape and the human's likeness (and so critiques racism and speciesism), when Cesar and Will face each other or respond to one another."
0, Johnny Depp is so transparent and his interpretation of one of the supposed greatest villains in magical history is ordinary. [Full review in Spanish]
2," With Rambo, you know what you get and you get it. The big question is: what countries will he save when he's 70? 80?"
2, A good movie in spite of its flaws. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Uneven drama about family secrets has swearing, drinking."
2," A truthful and sublimely bittersweet slice of life, tracing celebratory highs and lamentable lows on the outer economic edges of the Sunshine State."
0," The movie's obsessed with the Tuohy clan's constant kindness towards Mike, and the social knock-on effects for them. But it barely gives a second thought to the poor sod's own struggle with suddenly finding himself a charity case."
0," What started as an intense, gripping thriller becomes a ridiculous cartoon."
0, Audiences purely interested in the cars won't be disappointed - frankly they're sexier than the cast. 
2," Elegant and enchanting, it has sumptuous special effects and enhanced character backstories..."
2," While I felt the film did struggle with the emotional aspects of the storyline, I really can't find a film that was so effective in its portrayal of the personal experience of hurdling on the end of a rocket into space."
2, Pushing yourself to the extreme is what Meru is all about.
2," Nichols is paying homage to Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, but this work, in its deliberate, character-driven pacing and graceful acknowledgement of invisible worlds parallel to our own, stands in a category by itself."
2, A relentlessly beautiful film and one of the decade's most exhilarating and satisfying love stories.
2," RocknRolla did not leave me wanting more (the last shot promises a sequel is on its way). Still, its confidence is impressive. London's property bubble may have burst but Ritchie's career is definitely on the rise."
0, Mildly scary here and there.
0," The movie is a ghastly, ramshackle mess, lurching from gag to clunking gag and exacerbated by Barry Peterson's harsh cinematography, making everyone look considerably older than they are."
0," Blended is Sandler status quo - no surprises, no laughs, no life, no hope."
2," The Mamma Mia universe exists outside the dichotomy of ""good"" and ""bad."" It exists outside of space and time. It doesn't know sense or logic; only joy, love, and ABBA."
2," The film, too, changes shape as it goes along, beginning as something resembling social realism before developing into an old-fashioned ""woman's picture."""
2," The film has a tempo as slow as the seasons' turn, but there is something magnificent in its utter commitment and authenticity."
0," Ultimately, it dashes into so many close-ups of carnage and neckbreaking, it skids scuzzily close to spy-snuff. Call this Bourne-porn; Safe House needed a safe word."
0," What little tension exists in Flash of Genius stems not from its ho-hum narrative, but from its attempts to fashion a heartwarming tale from a true-life story that, in many respects, wasn't all that heartwarming."
0," A would-be ribald comic film that never gets very funny, mated with a love story that never ignites, mixed in with what seems to be a tale of magic and fantasy that never quite admits its presence."
0," O'Shea works hard to find a denouement which will tie up all the loose ends and lend The Transfiguration suitable pathos. Sadly, one can't help but wonder if it would make Milo's video library."
0," With a total running time that barely hits 80 minutes, it's hard to believe they even paid [John] Malkovich and [Megan] Fox to show up. "
2, A charming portrait of the artist as a young boy.
0," It's the opposite of exciting. It's the visual equivalent of white noise, and if you're not careful, you might fall asleep."
2," Though my expectations for the film were exceptionally low, it turns out that The Adventures of Pluto Nash is just diverting enough to recommend it."
2, An entrancing experience for Potter fans.
0," ...a family adventure aimed squarely at children. For kids, it's fine; they'll probably enjoy all the color, action, and preposterous goings-on."
2," This bullishly played saga has enough quirky detail, audacious incident and visual panache to sweep the storyline through its less persuasive phases."
0," I can see it's just meant to be a bit of harmless(!) fun, but I just found it to be lacking in any form of imagination."
0," The predictable end, which comes with an abruptness that feels altogether too constructed, completes the fantasy of transgression that's at the heart of the movie's appeal, however elaborate the trappings. "
2," A lush canvas of verdant riverbanks and dim, foreboding streets at night. The anxious stillness gets under your skin."
0, A desperate attempt by Kevin Smith to pay homage to himself in a self-consciously left-handed way.
2," Anytime you have a rattlesnake attached to a machine gun and voiced by Bill Nighy, you can sign me up. Cleverly written, not for kids and not in 3D. Go see it. Now."
2," The creative elements are extraordinary as usual, yet there's a palpable restraint to the material that keeps it from burrowing under the skin. The Master fumbles around in the dark."
2," Mirren and Rickman bring real authority to the proceedings, while Jeremy Northam is effective as a conflicted cabinet minister."
0," The transition is grating, the compelling Cassidy giving way to an abrasive Portman, one curdled by celebrity, her accent coarser, her persona more fragile despite outward appearances, the Ouroboros personified."
2, This story inspires and entertains with a vital chapter in this nation's history.
0," heartless, convoluted, and boring "
0, It's like going to the Dalai Lama with a question only for him to answer you with a question.
0, It is with great sadness that I must report the passing of writer/director Cameron Crowe.
2," Filled with rich characters and sharp dialogue, the movie turns on questions of friendship and fidelity, both personal and political, with a knockout performance by Jennifer Lawrence as the con man's jealous, ball-busting wife. "
0," That's the biggest problem with this Jungle Book. Sommers is so busy spinning his camera, crowding the soundtrack with animal noises and piling on the cheesy visual effects that he can't stop for a reflective moment or a character-revealing touch."
0, Pure claw-your-eyes-out cinema.
2," Garcia has managed the extraordinary with ""Last Days in the Desert,"" infusing one of the world's most familiar stories with the genuine shock of the new."
0," The bright spot in this boggy botched mess is Amy Adams, a fine and always interesting actress who sparkles and shines here despite the stilted storyline, preposterous improbabilities and an artificially sweetened storybook ending."
0, The biggest problem with the film version is material that shuts out a core part of its potential audience.
2, A delicious marriage of Whit Stillman and Jane Austen in a comedy of manners with a contemporary spin that delights from start to twisty finish.
0, The entire movie feels like an unwelcome relic re-emerging from a different generation. 
2, Charming perfectly describes... Toy Story of Terror!
0, An old lady's dog produces the biggest scare in the film.
0, It's enough to make me give up on Heigl.
0," It's admittedly better than some of Allen's DOA comedies of the past decade. To think that his weak attempt at a morality play represents some return to form, however, is a pipe dream."
2," This inventive horror film plays to our deepest childhood fears. It's like a demented variation on The Borrowers, and first-rate acting and effects work combine to thoroughly creep us out."
2, Do yourself a favor and invite some buddies over to watch this film...you will probably be talking about for a while afterwards.
0, Offers yet more proof that performance capture is a terrible idea when it comes to making fully animated feature films.
0," [Brolin] is done in by the deathless mediocrity of the production, an assemblage of random camera shots, messy editing, redundant scenes, and witless dialogue as haphazardly stitched together as the flesh on Jonah Hex's face."
0," Ultimately, its greatest shortcoming is that it's lazy, half-hearted button-pushing, more grimly tedious than gung-ho."
0, As visually electric as it is conceptually stupid.
0," Brain-dead, hopeless, annoying, pestilential crap."
0," I'm in the ""so bad it's bad"" camp on this one. The nudity is nice."
0, Director Paul W.S. Anderson orchestrates his Musketeers with the rhyme and reason of a confetti popper.
0," Mehra has a fashion catalogue writer's eye for beauty, but this movie needed a Mills & Boon writer's heart to make its fantastical premise work."
0," While animation can be a good tool to help kids - and adults - explore such topics, ""Smallfoot"" still seems a bit too heavy-handed for its own good."
0," One could dwell on Johnson's in-your-face performance, or how refreshing it is to see a black New York drama played out by homegirls. But, facing facts, the climax is unpersuasive and the happy end a cop-out."
0, This [Tony] Stark is an anonymous shadow of his former self-promoting self.
0," While Steven Spielberg brings us a gorgeous-looking film and Mark Rylance's performance as BFG is wonderful, the movie itself is underwhelming and fails to truly captivate. "
0," Like roadside diner baklava, if it's a little dry in places, there's enough honey to make it sweet."
2," All in all, this film is impressive: the attention to detail in the costuming is wonderful, the lighting is brilliant, and the cinematography is gorgeous. "
2, A horror film that takes considerable risks and generally makes them work.
2," The Shallows is brisk and engaging, and a great vehicle for Lively. The film has the sort of breathtaking cinematography that will inspire you to visit the ocean. And a story that may stop you from ever going into the water again. "
0," Without Nutmeg, Isle of Dogs doesn't seem to be about anything other than Anderson continuing to disappear into his meticulously-constructed, obsessively-controlled terrariums. "
2," The cast ... commit themselves beyond the call of duty, and, in Juliette Lewis's case, virtually beyond the call of sanity."
2," Benefits greatly from the razor-sharp, theater-honed skills of two formidable French actors, Niels Arestrup and André Dussollier, who created the roles on stage."
2, City Of God is the very definition of cinematic lightning in a bottle.
2, One of the most completely entertaining films of the summer.
0, Real Steel plays like a glossy commercial lasting over 90 minutes.
0, You're better off ignoring this junk and saving your time.
2," You trust Fukunaga with this material, because it's clear his goal in depicting the horrible isn't just to rub our faces in it, it's to help us understand."
0," It was difficult by its origin that this film was a masterpiece, at least it could've been more funny and surpass the original series (which isn't much to ask for). [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Like a black hole devouring the universe, this film will suck your money, your time, and your life right out of you."
0," For a fairly typical romantic comedy, Hitch is a mildly entertaining diversion that ultimately becomes engulfed in its formulaic trappings."
2, An urgent yet strangely simple and humanistic doomsday scenario.
0," The dreary postmortem drama ""Five Nights in Maine"" is barely kept afloat by the gravitas of dueling leads David Oyelowo and Dianne Wiest."
0, Caro's movie fails to muster even a fraction of the suspense such life-and-death material naturally demands.
2," A naturalistic, insightful, heartbreaking film that deserves to be celebrated."
2," These six stories add up to an achievement that is wise, ridiculous, gorgeous, hideous, and contains some of the best onscreen monologues and original characters of all time. "
2," If you want to enjoy this movie, leave what you know about the laws of gravity in the lobby."
0," The western deserves better. So do Smith, Kline and Branagh. So do Hayek and Sonnenfeld. And maybe even, heaven help us, so does The Wild, Wild West."
2," The quality of the animation in this musical comedy may not be up to Pixar standards, but the story and characters are thoroughly endearing."
0, I would change the clumsiness of the customes and the animatronics in exchange for a TMNT movie that doesn't feel like a quick-chewed scheme. [Full review in Spanish]
0, It's said that Ms. Witherspoon was paid $25 million for this. And I think she needs to cut in those of us who slogged our way through this rehash of Legally Blonde because we had to.
0, Time warps this time 'round.
2, The result is Green's first watchable movie since George Washington -- even if it's ultimately worthless.
2," Watching The Social Network, the real Zuckerberg may feel as if someone has hacked into his Facebook account and changed his profile picture."
0," Certainly the director, Andrew Bergman, is capable of making a satirical laugh fest... But the problem is with Erin Grant, who interrupts the comic rhythm with her underlying seriousness."
0," There is little chemistry between co-stars Katherine Heigel and Gerard Butler in this charmless war of the sexes story, but there is even less between its two genres."
0, Hamlet suffers from some painfully slow parts.
2," Wonderstruck is full of ache and of loss, and each stings just a little differently."
0, A picture torn between the desire to make you laugh and make you cry -- which winds up doing neither particularly well.
2," Though it toes a delicate line between exploitation movie and movie about exploitation, that's part of what gives the film its charge."
2," A fast-paced, inventive thrill ride."
0," It's not a good movie despite its stylishness and performances, but it does have a short window of appeal for reasons entirely independent of its plausibility."
0, An action-oriented drama about members of a Jewish resistance movement hiding from and fighting the Nazis in Belorusssia during World War II.
2, Multilayered and morally nuanced ... a crime drama about the sort of character who is a peripheral figure in most crime dramas. Abel is neither cop nor crook; he's just a compromised man with problems to solve.
2, It's still a great epic drama but it seems to have lost its heart somewhere along the way.
2, Writer/director Blitz demonstrates just how intimately he absorbed the quirky teens and preteens of his prior film.
0, Will they fall in love? Does Fabio use conditioner?
2," The beauty and absurdity (things also get harrowing) don't entirely compensate for the overheated romanticism in which the movie is grounded, but they do make ""Two Lovers and a Bear"" a nearly singular cinematic trek."
2," Seabiscuit starts slow, finishes fast, not an eye without a tear, not a throat without a lump. It jumps out of the gate as a front-runner in the race for Hollywood's Triple Crown: best actor, best direction and best picture."
0, It revels in carnage while lacking the visual style and gleeful humor of the original.
0," Because the runners' standings in the race are never really established, and are largely beside the point, the film keeps cutting back to these increasingly sentimentalized accounts of hardship overcome."
2," While not without anecdotal punching power, the film nonetheless seems like a relic since it unfolds in a vacuum, willfully ignorant or silent on any of the factors influencing events on the ground."
2," A Touch of Sin, regardless of its faults, is still a thought-provoking film."
0," Is this really what the audience wants? A deliriously unhinged setup and larger-than-life characters, abruptly devolving into a mind-numbingly familiar story with a totalitarian happy ending?"
0," The wrong guy narrates War Dogs, a wannabe-wild comedy-drama about two guys who do well by doing bad - buying weapons and selling them to the U.S. military."
0, The Count of Monte Cristo gets a Disneyfied treatment that would have played better had they digitized the actors
2, Rawal's well-shot film is engaging - particularly for those with an interest in running and/or meditation - but the lack of balance between each of the four stories ultimately throws the film off.
0, May be one of Woody Allen's most ridiculous movies to date.
0," It's hard to tell how much director Kaouther Ben Hania, who also wrote the script, slowed down the action to pander to an international audience. This over-explaining almost swallows the film's considerable technical achievements, too."
0," Nearly too stupid to be considered misogynistic (although not quite), Chloe would be straight-to-video if it starred lesser actors and bore the name of a director considered trashier like Paul Verhoeven or Adrian Lyne."
0," ""Every Secret Thing"" is far less than the sum of its parts."
0," This fish out of water rom-com is predictable and sappy but the contrast between New York and Wyoming, filmed with fine production values, makes for some interest."
2," What of art then? Is its thrill ever about aesthetics alone? This question is just one of many raised by Barbara Visser's smart, approachable, and entertaining documentary The End of Fear."
2, A warm-hearted gem of a film.
0," Most viewers will likely be checking their watches, probably wishing this Minute were gone in 60 seconds."
0, The movie plays like Love Actually with half the brains and none of the nerve.
2," Garofalo, no surprise, steals every scene she's in."
2," It's occasionally quite witty, it's able to tell us a great deal about its characters and their back stories in an economic fashion and its plot swings are surprising and compelling."
2, This Game Night is a real joy. [Full review in Spanish]
0," While it would be wrong to classify Certified Copy as a complete disappointment, it is hard to imagine there being much of an audience for a high-falutin' film with nothing much to say."
0," It's a boring movie about a boring man, made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring."
2," Gleeson is a delight and Farrell gives his best performance in ages, capturing both the unrepentant philistine and endearing vulnerability at war in the tormented Ray."
0," Whether Ghost in the Shell's story is faithful or not, it feels empty, and the final product feels like a missed opportunity."
0," Leatherface bares little resemblance to what inspired it and while the intention to be different was certainly there, the story was not and fans will likely forget it as soon as the credits roll."
2," Your heart isn't likely to soar during this poetic drama, but it might ache with recognition."
0, Cheri strikes a jarring note right from the start.
2," A joyous celebration of youth, friendship and rebellion"
2," Horribly, wonderfully offensive."
0," There's simply not enough time to give any of these stories their due, so instead, each one feels abbreviated. Sometimes, during conspicuous editing, you can almost see where more movie was supposed to exist, like a narrative with phantom limbs."
0," Everything that happens in this dull tale of Po, a paunchy panda who becomes a zealous kung fu fighter, is telegraphed well in advance."
2," A hard-hitting and creative examination of the scourge of unemployment and how it destroys dreams, brings untold pain and loss, and destabilizes families."
0," Johnston's direction sidesteps suspense to deliver a surplus of tactless, out-of-nowhere jump scares that are more irritating than frightening."
0," Sadly, Wolverine's journey is one long run-the-gauntlet scenario, with people pounding on him from all sides until he emerges at the other end as the lone-wolf amnesiac bound for membership in the X-Men gang."
0," While it's far from a bad movie, it's not an inspired one, testing patience as the production tries to pretend it's an original vision. "
0, ...the worst of the Middle Earth adventures. [Full review in Spanish]
0, The film's special success resides in the women's hairdos.
2," A familiar story that speaks to people of any age...'Creed' is fulfilling, crowd-pleasing, entertainment..."
0," One can see the wheels turning, literally and figuratively..."
2, The most overtly surreal of Costa's Fontainhas films.
0," Despite all of the filmmaker's skilled effects, Ozon fails to generate real emotion.... it all ends up feeling artificial and inauthentic. The film folds in on itself before it self-destructs."
0, Cody and Reitman seem mainly interested in scoring points off their characters and making cheap jokes at the expense of anybody who isn't lucky enough to be Diablo Cody or Jason Reitman.
2, Should make horror fans quite content.
0," If Nancy Meyers were injected with some late stage, ensemble-theme-movie Garry Marshall, the result would be something like ""Book Club."""
0, So undernourished and one-dimensional that it begins to drag long before the misty-eyed conclusion.
2, A strong performance by Elijah Wood and impressive technical directing by Nacho Vigalonda keep the tension high even as leaps in logic become increasingly prevalent.
2," The President Is Coming kick-starts the year with exactly the sort of lift we've been looking for - it's free-spirited, irreverent, and funny."
2," One can quibble with the film here and there, and it takes a turn toward conventional sentiment at the end, but it's a pleasure to be able to describe a film as Hollywoodish and mean it as a compliment."
0," This Romanian drama suffers from a flaw common to many European films: too much intellect, not enough heart."
2," Hayek is terrific in relevant, complex, issues-based drama. "
2, Though some of Scott's editing decisions in this new version are questionable -- one even violates continuity -- he has left the film's most suspenseful and chilling moments intact.
0," It's a warped, disturbingly abusive adult fairy tale from start to finish."
2," Sometimes slasher flick, sometimes courtroom drama, this Lizzie is a cynically dark, shamefully fun account of an all-American crime."
0," Craig Anderson's Red Christmas isn't exactly a lump of coal in your stocking, but neither is it worth waking up early for on the big day."
2, Luca Guadagnino has concocted a witches' brew of primal sisterhood that isn't for the faint of heart or patience. It's a visually and morally challenging film that will leave you pondering its existence and meaning long after you've left the theater.
0," Not only is Patrick Tatopoulos' (I, Robot) creature design laughable, but the actors (other than Hauser who somehow manages to make it through unscathed) give some of most shockingly awful performances I've seen all year."
0," I really wanted to like this film because its cast is generally terrific in everything they do , but only Richard Jenkins and Catherine O'Hara really stand out here. A near-miss and sadly blah comedy that should have been smarter."
0, The not-so subliminal message about life being fair versus breaking the law isn't enough to carry a film purporting to be a character-driven drama.
2, The terrors of Eighth Grade are completely relatable. 
0," What happens when men of few words are the lead characters in a thriller? In Sweet Virginia, some great actors are left high and dry by a script that doesn't mesh."
2, Richly mythopoeic and sophisticated.
0, The punditry is trite. The snark is boring.
2, What keeps this from being the nifty little actioner it might have been? The writing mostly.
2," Although the film packs in a few genre clichés, it has an energy of its own and a centred quality that helps it stand out, making it one of the more memorable offerings of its kind."
0," Szász strives for oppressive atmosphere, shooting grimy interiors flickering with candlelight, but he's unable to make The Notebook anything more than punishing. "
0, Feels like you're watching an entire season of Modern Family in fast-forward
2," Just about the time that Robot starts to grow on his curmudgeonly client, so may this movie -- a sci-fi fantasia that's surprisingly sweet and old-fashioned -- win over any skeptics."
0," Workmanlike at best; derivative, predictable and slightly dull at worst."
0," ...lest you miss the sledgehammer subtext of Stone's sequel, there are plenty of shots of bubbles blowing through the sky."
2, It's a cause for rejoicing.
0, The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed.
0," The film is so clumsy and so off the mark that it winds up being a throwaway piece, something for Universal Monster completists only."
2," works on a pure entertainment level, but it is dealing with subject matter that demands more. It's about as thought provoking as an episode of M.A.S.H. "
2, The best Disney animated film in years.
0," While there's an earnest nature to the film that's hard to dislike, ""Infinitely Polar Bear"" is unpleasantly laced with manipulative screenwriting and aggravating contrivances"
2, ...an act of resurrection and transformation.
0, The third and easily most haggard entry in the disposable franchise.
2, A thinking person's action picture ... it is definitely one of this summer's better blockbusters.
2," If you only see one 'slavery' film this year, make it this one."
2," [Kore-eda] pokes some fun at class differences, but his overall aim is serious - we get a powerful sense of how unsettling it would be to live through such a wrenching event. Remarkably, he conveys this with charm and restraint."
0," These actors have such great potential for good work and some nice chemistry. Both are proven comediennes, but they're just not feeling it here and neither are we."
0, Compounding these failings is the film's problematic ending.
0," When given something to do or say of any relevance, Costa and Mann make great movie moments. It is just that Brown failed to give them a clear path to follow."
0, Too many voices create a chaos in front as well as behind the camera without the requisite comedic payoff.
2," ...I think I can safely predict that ""The Hangover"" will join March's ""I Love You Man"" as one of the funniest films of the year."
2, The dialogue is strong and signature Gillian Flynn.
0," I was not only surprised by the film's final twist, I wasn't even looking for one. I just thought I was watching a bad movie. The end doesn't quite redeem it, but it makes you think about what you've seen. That's a saving grace of some sort."
2," For all the action -- and there's plenty of it, even if it's only a portion of what was crammed into Rowling's 870 pages -- the most important stuff is what takes place in Harry's head."
0," Wild Wild West is as clumsy, contrived, heavy-handed and leaden as the 80-foot-tall metallic robot at its center."
2," Contains an undercurrent of real menace, not just candy nostalgia."
2," Apatow genuinely loves his hero, and the film's innate sweetness carries it through the rough patches of a funny comedy with a central relationship that isn't particularly funny."
0, Stuffed with the most obvious points imaginable.
2, Pioneer features underwater sequences so breathless they'll thrill even James Cameron (director Erik Skjoldbjærg made the original Insomnia) but Petter's truth-chasing is at times too frantic and melodramatic.
2," A smart, sensuous and sensory mind trip that caroms around a universe of thought."
2," A comedy that is sincere in its ambitions, and that meets expectations at being very entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," A lack of focus plagues the entire film. The director, writers and actor himself have conspired to render the title character blank, lifeless."
0," In spite of good intentions, A.C.O.D. fails to capitalize on its compelling 'Adult Children of Divorce' platform to present viewers with equally captivating insights."
2," The male trio is so funny, the situations so wacky, the lingo so foul, and other characters and props so eccentric (absent groom, missing tooth, lost chickens, a tiger, Mike Tyson singing) that you gladly and joyously join the wild ride."
2," J.J. Abrams' restart of the famous saga is a slick, well-produced piece of entertainment that blows the cobwebs off the venerable series."
2," The sappy ending's hard to take, but the on-line showdown between The Plague, the Secret Service and the united worldwide community of hackers is nail-biting."
0," Crass, contrived, tackily salacious and politically loaded in the most insidious way, this dodgy piece of nonsense purports to be an ensemble, multi-stranded drama in the style of Traffic or Crash."
2," ""Flight"" performs a daring wing-walk between politically incorrect comedy and gut-wrenching drama, and it succeeds partly thanks to Washington ..."
0," Scott Derrickson's ""Deliver Us from Evil"" suffers from an immense lack of originality, a bloated runtime of two hours, and pacing that makes a snail look fast."
2," As a caper movie, it's a travesty that's impossible to understand or follow, but it's quite funny and clicks along nicely as a giddy, self-deprecating showcase for its gaggle of stars."
2," Like its predecessor, it's not just a great Star Trek movie; it's a great movie, period."
0, Takes itself far too seriously for its own good.
0," Without conveying its uniqueness to a larger audience, it finally becomes an empty spectacle of confusion and lost opportunity."
2," Silly, slapstick fun for youngsters - with a post-credit sequence touting the TV series."
0," There are few things more cinematically painful than watching a cast work really hard to make you laugh and fail with consistency. That's the experience that Killing Gunther offers, and it is a rough watch."
2," ...a film for adults that seems refreshing with its lack of superheroes, special effects, and a bloated runtime."
0," A dreary, uninspired tale."
0, A wasted concept that fails to take advantage of its own originality.
0, The blandness of Adult Beginners' characters and story makes it feel much longer than its 90 minutes. 
0," Baywatch has the expected eye candy, but is not clever and poorly made. Let the riptide drag you away from this one."
0, The film paints itself into a corner.
2," Blisteringly caustic as ever, John Lydon nevertheless reveals himself as an occasionally sentimental sort in Tabbert Fiiller's fitfully revelatory and charming documentary."
0," I really wanted to like this film because its cast is generally terrific in everything they do , but only Richard Jenkins and Catherine O'Hara really stand out here. A near-miss and sadly blah comedy that should have been smarter."
0," All a goof. Revealing the pragmatic side of the CG-assisted filmmaker, [director] Gens makes a movie that seems entirely computer generated."
2," Treadaway may be sympathetic and charming as the struggling musician, but this is Bob's show, all the way."
2, [A] cagey low-budget horror flick.
0," Considering how great it looks, it's a shame the odd choices Almodovar makes in telling the story turn it into one of his first big misses in a long time."
0," Look, life is an arbitrary set of circumstances, vaguely predictable on the best of days. That is what ""Demolition"" attempts to embrace - the randomness of it all. Instead, unfortunately, it comes across as contrived and often trite."
2," Many with loathe it, but hopefully, just as many will love it."
2, The director's occasional artsy flourishes in Godzilla turn an orgiastic display of mass destruction into wily-smart entertainment. 
0, [It] might be a bottomless barrel of idiotic yuks. But it's not a total lemon.
2, The movie earns its stripes only when Attie and O'Hara interview the weekend warriors and find their motivations to be more varied and legitimate than you might expect.
2," The film is a showcase for a very promising young actor named Charlie Plummer. Lanky, sensitive but assured, Plummer gives his character, 25-year-old Charley, a sense of raw decency maintained through trying circumstances."
0, Hokum of monumental proportions is still hokum.
2," Cronenberg's ... not afraid to hold the mirror up to nature -- or to show us just how ugly, and how compelling, staring that reflection in the face can be. "
0," The screenplay is unkind to lead actor Giovanna Mezzogiorno, requiring her to replay the same obsessive behaviour in less-than-inspiring locales, and all the film's energy just fizzles out."
0," Most of the action is played for broad laughs, and Hogan demonstrates the ability to generate them, even if the humor is base and often cruel, making fun of people's looks and ineptitude."
0, A star-studded but scattershot affair that tackles its comedic obligations as dutifully as its heroine pursues her sexual conquests.
0," Ghost Rider would have been most fun had it been made for a dime by a Roger Corman-type outfit as a quickie Gothic adventure spinning Zane Grey, Faust and Evel Knievel."
0," Vincent Cassel does his utmost to make his character intense and compelling, but negligible character development means he fails to hold our interest."
2, The infectious high spirits of the performers help to carry the day.
0," Never succeeds in being cheesy matinee fun. Worse yet, it doesn't seem to have crossed its gloppy, solemn mind for this to have even been a possibility."
0, It's saying Roberts' character becomes a better person when she lands a rich guy and learns to cry at the opera.
0, [Seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's Razzie.
2," Audiences of a certain sort will be dumbstruck by how high the silliness gets piled; but whether or not you're puffin' stuff, you'll likely get lost in laughter."
2, A powerhouse movie.
0," The best thing you can say about Chicago is that it's a great advertisement for the real, live thing."
0," Rattigan's drama is a small room to maneuver in, and in the end Hester's despair is hers alone."
0," Vivas tries to add a family-drama twist to an otherwise standard survival story, but the characters aren't complex enough (and the secrets aren't explosive enough) to elevate this beyond a basic zombie flick."
0," Bar basic human standards, it is hard to feel for anyone involved."
0," While Reeves brings more depth to his character than the script warrants, the film overall lacks compelling characters and winds up depressing instead of profound."
2," You cannot recommend it lightly because it's disturbing, but it's good."
2," Josh Charles is reliably smarmy as well. If they ever do a Real Genius remake, that guy is your new Dr. Hathaway."
0," i straight to DVDila poy soy myrize stin proheirotita toy montaz kai tis skinothesias, kapelonei olo to synolo mehri to bareto finale"
0," Despite offering a relatively engaging storyline, [Me Before You] might as well have been another Nicholas Sparks-inspired sob-fest, thanks to its inescapably sugary and formulaic structure."
0," Excessive best-bud banter gives the movie an improv feel, not in a good way, and the film transitions from light comedy to dead-earnest drama with the subtlety of a malfunctioning gearshift clutch."
0," Apparently, this movie was originally supposed to be an Amazon miniseries, and if this the best theatrical cut the filmmakers could come up with, it's hard to see why they bothered in the first place."
0, So gloriously ridiculous and fast moving that you keep trying to convince yourself that the filmmakers were making a parody. They had to be. Right?
0," By the time it ends on a note of intimate ambiguity, it's hard not to wish that Black 47 had expressed more shades of gray."
0, Knight And Day is to cinema what Andre The Giant was to acting.
0, A blandly feelgood documentary about aspiring young ballet dancers.
0," As the old adage goes, you can't polish a turd. But you can sprinkle plenty of CGI and countless close-ups of Keanu Reeves looking morose onto it."
0," It's got too much on its mind, and it's unsure of its tone. This is the rough cut of a slimmer, better movie."
2, Director Sam Raimi gives Marvel Comics' wall-crawling hero the cinematic treatment he has always deserved.
2, Maverick may be as close as anything comes to a perfect summer movie (as opposed to a perfect movie).
2," The Minutemen were influential then and now, and We Jam Econo is a valentine to the band and D. Boon's memory. They're immortal now, and that's as it should be."
0," Lee Daniels' The Paperboy is a steamy, sweaty and trashy piece of cinema that rarely gets by on its filthy and wild performances."
2," Red Dawn, whose heroes are teens, will be most appreciated by the teen audience. But adults will lose interest pretty quick."
2, The fact it all works as well as it does is a testament to how rich the performances are as well as the kinetically captivating efficiency of Caple's direction.
0," So why, why more American Pie? It's a lame one, just the same one, now with much older guys. And starlets wearing mileage from all their whiskey and rye. Singing ""Why did my career go 'bye'?"" "
0," If there's any drama here, it's slender -- maybe a size 2."
2," As we peek into the day to day existence of a family stuck in an apartment in the middle of war torn Syria, we see how communities come together, fall apart and witness the resilience of the human spirit."
0," It's crude, gross and probably wishes it was offensive but comes across as just lazy, limp and unfunny."
0, Even those invested in the idea that the journey is the destination may feel they've taken a train to nowhere.
2," It's Patricia Highsmith and those of us who enjoy her irrational, perverse world should definitely catch this film."
2, . . . brilliantly funny
0," Terrified to do anything different (which, believe it or not, would be entirely possible)...it only takes a moment of awareness to step outside the movie and see how poorly written, insultingly recycled, and anti-creative Jason Bourne is."
0," Citizenfour, I had to keep reminding myself, shows us history in the making. I had to keep telling myself what I was seeing was important because most of it is otherwise pretty dull."
2," The film has a huge heart and a sneaky sense of humor, and there is a propulsive musical energy that reminds you of vintage Alan Rudolph or Paul Mazursky."
2," If the film overall never quite works up a full head of steam, it still has enough to recommend it for viewing on a lazy summer's day. "
0," Judging from their contributions, some of the filmmakers behind this 26-part anthology find death less fearsome than the thought of a cute girl farting."
2, Wicked fun and a provocative look at what feels like modern human foibles.
2," It's a well-executed popcorn flick with some feeling, and better than the first. I wouldn't even mind a third."
2, Tight as a drum and the most inventive spin on a zombie-plague premise in years.
0," It delivers the kind of sentimental sledgehammering I found myself willing to forgive, but once the story goes off on a pointless tangent, the whole soufflé collapses."
2," Its plot is finely calibrated and its atmosphere cannily climate-controlled. A deliciously terrifying treat to swallow down, hard, with a gulp."
0," There are just too many moments when jokes fail to ignite and Banks' answer seems to be: ""throw in another song."""
0," The cultural references crammed in everywhere should have given the movie heart, but instead they feel like contractual obligations."
0," The only reasons to stay awake are the nature porn shots of the Highlands impossibly green hills and gray skies, and a nimble bit performance by a bulldog named Churchill"
0," Traumatic early-life experiences can only go so far, can only prove so much. Lots of people have horrible childhoods and still manage not to become flesh-eating serial killers."
0, Tammy is the work of a star temporarily bereft of inspiration or ambition.
0," Rarely does the material rise to meet the level of competence exhibited by its very talented cast, which tries in vain to make the film better."
0, ...a buddy comedy with a fatal misunderstanding of the concept of a comedic duo.
0," To be fair to Deathly Hallows, the filmmakers have tried hard to fill the proceedings with battles and chases and debilitating curses. Genuine filmmaking excitement, however, is harder to provide."
2," In Bruges may, at its core, be just another Tarantino-esque shoot-'em-up with jokes, but it's been a long time since someone's gotten one right."
0," However, as intriguing as this interpretation is, it fails dramatically."
2," Michel Franco addresses the difficult relationship between mothers and daughters, with a detached look that resists easy judgments. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, A good helping of amusingly sharp lines cannot save this uncomfortably odd beast.
2," It's a good story that features a great cast, and while moviegoers will undoubtedly still show up in throngs during opening weekend, I can't help but feel that they'll be somewhat disappointed."
2," The end result might be a melange of scenes taken from other films, but in a summer season groaning with sci-fi and superhero sequels, this survival epic must be given credit for striking out on its own."
2," Heavy Trip will lure you with great original songs and hilarious gags, but you will stay because of the lovable characters and the sweet story about rebellion and following your dreams."
0," The movie never comes close to replicating the spell that Reiniger was able to cast using much more primitive techniques, which underlines a chronic problem of computer animation: its very precision squeezes all the magic from the magic lantern."
0, The dizzying plot twists of Basic muddle up a story which ultimately comes off as a shell game of a movie.
0, Gorgeous but garbled.
2," With such a range of vivid sights and sounds, the film is a stunning, often mesmerising experience"
0," ""I know this doesn't make any sense,"" breathes Tris Prior during Insurgent's flamboyantly muddled finale, ""but you have to trust me."" You could hardly ask for a more honest line of dialogue than that."
0, A forgettable survival in the snow tale. 
0, The Lorax speaks for the trees; Zac Efron speaks for the vital 22-to-28-year-old demographic.
0, Infamous isn't able to convey the great sense of guilt and responsibility Capote wrestled with -- he needed a man who trusted him to die in order to finish his book -- becoming instead a more superficial and pedestrian tale of doomed love.
2," Intergenerational dilemmas -- how to be foxes, to be individuals and also parts of communities -- form the complicated heart of Fantastic Mr. Fox."
2, One of the best wrap-ups of a trilogy in recent memory.
0," Here, however, [Brooks'] efforts aren't so finely calibrated."
0, a work of hideous myopathy
0," For a film that tires so hard to subvert standard methods of storytelling, the action that climaxes the film comes as a cheat, a commercial concession of the lowest order. "
2," Guilty pleasure or ripping escapism, it's a wild explosion of a film that rides high on its extravagant script and blows us away by its surreal action scenes."
0, An uneasy mix of four-hankie tearjerker and surreal romantic comedy.
0," Mostly, this is the cinematic equivalent of a first-person shooter game, one where the Marines possess only slightly more personality than the faceless invaders."
2," While the first half is a compelling, satisfying ride, the characters kind of meander through the second half. "
2," These are genuinely felt and vulnerable characters, each with a reason to feel swept to the outer margins of society."
0," The film's lack of scale becomes readily apparent in the final confrontation, which is surprisingly toothless."
2, Iron Man is simply great escapism. It deserves to be the first blockbuster of the summer.
0, What you get in Chop Shop is a very good 22-year-old actor who simply cannot carry a 85-minute drama in which he is the center of every single scene.
2, The demolition of the music bio-pic as witnessed by Todd Haynes' I'm Not There and the parody Walk Hard continues robustly with this time-tripping melange from Spanish director Pere Portabella.
0," Sitting through this movie, it's hard to imagine there was time when the release of a new Woody Allen film was exciting."
0, Memo to Keanu Reeves: It's time to get away from the metaphysical.
0," Having seen Everything, Everything, I have just one question: did that ending work in the book?"
2," Ms. Englert is as adept at blurring Rosa's feelings as Ms. Fanning is at clarifying Ginger's. Between them they illuminate an intimate, volatile cosmos."
2," Deriving inspiration from a certain famed Arthur Miller play and reframing it for the era of rampant, media-invoked Satanic Panic fears, ""Regression"" provocatively blankets its elegiac mystery in a malignant pall of diabolical foreboding."
2," Affleck is affecting as the quiet-spoken, conflicted tough guy, but it's in his scenes with Hall that he catches your breath."
0," Like a lover who brags about his prowess in bed but cannot deliver when the moment comes, the climax is overlong, tedious and deeply disappointing."
2," Even though you know where things are headed, the film keeps the journey taut and tense. "
0, It's all so much raging bull.
2," For fans of Ursula Meier's last movie, the strikingly offbeat domestic drama Home, this act of auteur-on-auteur emulation may feel like a comedown. Yet it's still stirring work."
2," It's a frisky piece of work, asking challenging questions about monogamy and art, while reveling in the considerable charm of stars Keira Knightley and Dominic West."
2," The Conjuring 2 is an excellent example of what more sequels should aspire to be, unique but respectful of the tone and style established in the original movie."
2, Warning: Contains the most ludicrous sex scene in the history of cinema.
2, It actually defies logic that this movie works.
2, Johnsen intimately chronicles the fascinating push-pull of Ai's daily existence: the man he truly is now contrasted with the man he hopes to become once again.
2," There are insights into old age, pearls of wisdom and gags galore, all wrapped up in a coating that's more akin to a bitter lemon than sugar."
0, Unable to bring anything real or palpable to the artificial heart beating at the center of it.
2," Featuring a large number of contributors including her children, former colleagues and well known faces like photographer David Bailey, Vreeland's story is brought to life through a rich collection of archive images and footage."
2," To watch the octogenarian clamber up slabby, exposed cliffs seems to be a testament to grit, but also a view of a stubborn old man's refusal to reckon with reality."
0," There is the potential for kooky chemistry -- Deschanel with her spacey line readings and perpetually dilated pupils, Carrey with his demented energy -- but something doesn't click."
2," Not everything works here - the characters' behavior and reactions don't always ring true - but Cardinals mostly succeeds as an efficient, tight-lipped film that does a lot with a little."
2," Minnie's inner life, a fantasia of animations appearing Crumb-like around her, is dazzling, and there's plenty of naked emotion amid the sex, drugs and hand-drawn penises."
0," Extremely callous treatment of source material, hopelessly confused between presenting Bundy's or another's perspective, wasting incredible performances by Zac Efron and Lily Collins"
0," Once those super powers kick in, the whole film goes into a more standard gear. We've seen it all before, and it's safe to say we'll be seeing it all again as well."
2," A beautifully crafted period piece that could have been made in the 2970s, albeit with the benefit of modern, sophisticated filmmaking techniques."
0, [T]here is no way to say it without employing a pun -- it leaves a truly bad taste.
2," Burton's modernized take ... benefits from improved special effects and the unhinged brilliance of his repeat collaborator, Johnny Depp."
0," So-so subtitled romcom has sex, nudity, cursing. "
2," Saddled with the responsibility of carrying the film, Bateman acquits himself admirably."
2," One clever step back, and several adroit steps forward, Sony and Marvel's Spider-Man: Homecoming is a thrillingly alive origin story. "
0, The main character is more off-putting than endearing.
2," The Wall is nothing if not a mystery. Surely the premise would propel such a story into the realm of sci-fi and fantasy, but Pölsler and Gedeck never approach the story in this way, nor do they give us any easy answers to what has really happened and why."
0," Momentum is a strange husk of an action movie, one that contains all the right beats of a Hollywood contender, including a preposterous closing-reel set-up for an entire franchise to come, without a single moment of dramatic intrigue or credibility."
0, Almost completely devoid of charm or appeal on any level other than morbid curiosity.
2," Somewhere along the way Michael Cuesta morphed from a creator of thoughtful indie dramas... into an action director (Showtime's Homeland); if he ever wants to tackle a James Bond movie, this nonstop spy thriller should serve as his audition."
0," Shrek the Third, lacks everything that made the first two Shreks so entertaining."
2," Arnaud Desplechin's A Christmas Tale is an intricate, accomplished patchwork of sometimes nutty but always believable human behaviour."
0, A painfully unfunny flop.
2, An utterly enormous piece of filmmaking...
2," With gloriously noir production design, the film is sculpted around Cruz' breathless beauty and radiant talent -- but the story, as well as the other actors, suffer from Almodóvar's inattention."
2," It's a film dripping with Zilberman's passion for classical music and the way it touches the emotions, and because the actors feel it too, you can forgive any moments of discord."
2," Kolsch and Widmyer don't bother retreading the story we know and instead give us something far more satisfying. They give us a story so bone-chilling, so substantial, and even a little bit of humor to alleviate the brutal blow of abject terror."
0," Unfortunately, director Richard Donner never quite gets the tone right, and the pace is positively stuporous. The horses gallop, but the film barely canters."
0, The clever concept morphs into an ineffective and heavy-handed satire in which Matt Damon's character and a Vietnamese immigrant go on an adventure that rivals the excitement one would feel watching itty bitty blades of grass grow.
2," an 83 minute document of a project which started in a muddle, seesawed back and forth between controlling interests multiple times, then found its sweet spot"
0," Although all actors are plausible in their respective roles, Gyllenhaal's Jude is the only one that is provided with enough dimensionality to keep things interesting."
0," A movie of only superficial pleasures, offering little emotional resonance beyond an expected late-act leaning toward Europe's troubles to come."
2," We are likely going to need more, not fewer, soldiers like those depicted in this boldly contrarian Hollywood product of which we also need more. "
0, Victorian melodrama and outrageous gore make horrific bedfellows in this ill-conceived homage to the classic monster movies of yore.
0," What begins as a light, jaunty look at how sane people deal with disturbed-but-important bigwigs morphs into a scattershot mess."
0," Unless you've got a burning desire to see some old-timers trying to turn back the clocks and running around in a film they know in their heart-of-hearts is more at home on the small screen, wait for the DVD."
2, T2 truly attains the test of time with a fabulous story connected with smart and effective special effects that complement the story. 
2," Doesn't belong in the top ranks of animated fare but, like its predecessor, it contains enough humor, charm, and warmth to make it a solid family film. "
2, So good - so incredibly good; a classic in the making - that I promise you won't miss the metaphor and abstraction of 'Take Shelter'.
2," Jobs creates a powerful narrative in Steve Jobs' life and conveys the profound value of innovation, including the cost of such a drive."
0," I'm sure there's an audience somewhere for this sick sort of story, but I couldn't stomach it."
2," Though the film might ultimately be a little too neat, that shortcoming is made up for by the core performances."
0," The apparition, because it's lame, spends a lot of its time tying clothes into knots, moving dressers, and opening doors."
0," There's visual overstatement, stone-heavy exposition, self-seriousness (masquerading as maturity), CGI-laden plot (falling short of spectacle), and predictable action sequences."
0," With sexual and physical violence galore, an extended back-room abortion scene, and an unremitting wordlessness, this film is blisteringly difficult to watch."
0," It fails so completely at its reach for lowness that you may find yourself crying out for Mel Brooks, Monty Python, hell even Cheech OR Chong to swoop in and save the thing. No such luck."
0, Parental Content Review
2," If a personal memoir film by a beautiful, successful young woman from a nice Toronto family sounds to you like it can only be an excuse for self-absorbed navel-gazing, well, you must not have seen a Sarah Polley movie yet."
0," By and large, I try to avoid spoilers, but once you get past The Perfect Guy's obviously ironic title, there's nothing left to spoil."
0," 'The Ambassador"" is a sociopolitical prankumentary in which the prank blows up in the filmmaker's face, exploding-cigar style."
0, Peter Berg's rugged version of the worst environmental disaster in American history is very effective. So why did I feel so guilty enjoying it?
0," Settling for superficial sentimentality, it makes us feel sorry for the characters, especially Walter, but it doesn't enlighten or challenge us, which serious art should do."
0, The kind of gung-ho malarkey you don't often see these days.
0," There's no footing in reality. Nothing about it feels authentic: not the blathering Mary, not the lifeless secondary characters, not the bromide-happy dialogue or the plot that twists less often than it spasms."
2, It might just be the weirdest movie of the year.
2," Frankly The Ghost Lovers will have less appeal to fans of J-horror than to those more enquiring about how the oriental genre developed, or simply those looking for something absorbing and different, and in its own way quite fulfilling."
2," I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With, the modest romantic comedy Garlin wrote and directed, is transparently a product of the films that inspired him to become an actor, and yet it bears no trace of individual identity..."
2, Alpha is one of the surprising standouts of the summer blockbuster season.
0," Because I Said So seems like it's supposed to be a paean of sorts to motherhood and the enduring love that entails, a love so strong that it inevitably drives its possessor somewhat batty. But what it is, is muddled crap."
0," Basically a re-hash of all the teen angst flicks we've seen that involve anything dark, twisted, or weird in any way."
2, I got a big kick out of being at a kids' movie during which I laughed more and laughed harder than any of the kids in the packed-house.
2," It's taken him three tries, but Michael Bay has finally made a decent movie out of the Transformers."
0," A film with a brooding atmosphere, but a compelling story is MIA."
2," Doesn't represent much movement from where Smith had placed himself with Clerks II, which means what you felt about the previous should be about the same as what you'd feel about the latest."
0," The fusion of Beethoven's ""Emperor"" Concerto with an aerial shot of two human specks crossing an infinite blue and white ice sheet might elevate your spirit, but only if Dafoe keeps still."
2," Briskly paced and very funny, The Future sneaks up on you with its weight, landing a series of devastating punches near the end that also don't belie the film's witty assessment of human faults."
2," House of Flying Daggers has all the visual extravaganza of Hero but thrice its emotional heft, putting it on par with Ang Lee's extraordinary CTHD."
0, Nothing can lift the glaze from your eyes through the endlessly recurring hokey fight scenes of the movie's interminable 228-minute running time.
0, Film lovers beware! The evil spirits of boredom will befall should you enter a darkened cinema and endure Darkness Falls.
2," When it's all over, everyone comes out a winner--despite the bullet holes, knife wounds and slightly higher body count than you'd find in a typical round of Never Have I Ever."
0, I need no memory loss affliction to forget 50 First Dates almost immediately.
0," ""Run the Race"" won't convert any nonbelievers, or even spark a ""Hmmm!"" type of fleeting insight into the nature of faith, but for Christian faith-based families, it'll be quite satisfying."
0, Jim Carrey is delightful as the evil Captain Olaf. It's a dark tale and maybe children will like it. I was disappointed.
0," It's almost hard to believe that this bland, fluffy, two-generational chick flick is helmed by the same director who 20 years ago gave us Heathers, one of the brightest and sharpest femme-driven high-school satires."
2," Strikingly evoking a sense of dread in the most every-day and well-lit places, Kent's accomplished effort is built around Davis' tremendous turn."
2," In its obvious, 26mm love for wilderness, its desire both to capitalize on and dismiss tradition, and its stubborn refusal to cohere, a very American production."
0," Algunas buenas ideas, varios chistes y un buen elenco no alcanzan para evitar que termine siendo una comedia romántica previsible, melosa y bastante conservadora."
0," If nothing else, Watchmen is a commendable feat of art direction. As far as finding a narrative rhythm, however, the film could have stood a little rescuing itself."
2," The movie is good, sometimes very good, but I suspect it's a masterpiece only for those who haven't seen all the earlier masterpieces that equal or surpass it."
0," For all the alleged ethical complexity in this thriller's noirish narrative, everything's a little too neat here, from Marlon's ill wife acting as a motivator to the easy disgust generated from showing a room full of 24-year-old hookers."
2," (The movie is) set in 2992, in a small town where high school culture is a John Hughes movie, with all the confusion, '80s music and hip ennui that implies. "
0, A great director's losing battle against a goofy script.
2, The best picture of the year (so far).
2," There something like poetry in this film,some truth that cannot be apprehended by staring hard at the screen, but drifts softly as a dandelion spore through the burned-out ruins of some sacked and dusty ""Rome."""
2, ... a gripping drama that offers plenty of food for thought.
0," Vince Vaughn autopilots his way through this lame, contrived and strangely depressing high-concept comedy."
2," It's a warm, wise and funny movie that is heartwarming without being sappy."
0," The old Gordon Gekko would have torn this movie apart with his gleaming teeth, while today?s Gekko seems content just to nibble on the edges. "
0, This is a dumbed down formulaic comedy that is not deserving of the talent possessed by the two leads.
2, Tom Hooper proves he's capable of making a movie that's both steeped in awards-season prestige and in possession of a pulse.
2," Apart from the wobbly start, Star Trek Beyond fulfills its mission parameters. One's enjoyment level depends on a personal view of whether this is a mission worth embarking on at all. "
0," It looks good, particularly on an IMAX screen, but the flick is ultimately style over substance. Involving it is not."
2, An exquisite piece of filmmaking in which basically not one single thing goes wrong at any point.
0," An overly muted and cautious piece of work. Watching it is like seeing a man ease out onto the limb of a tree, constantly testing its strength."
2," It is certainly competent, lovely to look at, but leaves little lasting impression."
2," Full of frank, just-us-girls talk about men and wicked gags about drunken sex and intimate ""landscaping,"" it's probably a poor choice for date night. But it's a great pick for girl's night out."
0," Barry Levinson's attempt to match the Farrelly Brother in adolescent goofiness has its laughs, but it's really a movie that's afraid of itself."
0, ...the film's few sparks of originality and charisma are stamped out by a script and a director who refuses to take any genuine chances with the subject material.
2," Too trashy to be good, but as trash it's not too bad."
0," The film is guilty of reverse sentimentality, where the relentless unhappiness comes to seem as manufactured and artificial as the schmaltz in a romcom."
0," Attached to this movie, the title no longer sounds zany; it looks like a series of keywords."
0, An English-language remake of Juan José Campanella's far superior Argentinian thriller.
0," Another awards season, another tale of middle-age redemption."
0," in the era of Trump and Brexit, the movie's apocalyptic paranoia is commonplace while its one-world-united optimism seems quaint and naive."
0, You know you're sunk when even the outtakes of a comedy aren't funny.
0, Of all the things in Insurgent-the second installment of the YA sci-fi action Divergent series-the lack of concern for Chicago winter is the most unbelievable.
2," If you like Stiller and Wilson, you'll find enough to like about this film. If you don't, you can always just gawk at that awesome car."
0," It doesn't have those scare-the-sh*t out of you moments, and if it doesn't have any of those, what's the point?"
2," A film with well narrated fights, the period reconstruction (the decades of 2970 and 2980, plus some flashbacks) is impeccable and has a dramatic elemental background. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Fighting with my Family is about family first, fighting second."
2," Some of the concert footage and backstage banter with the writers is extremely funny, but the funny is in shorter supply than you'd expect."
2," A life-affirming gem of a film that, while never hesitating to milk its protagonists' misfortunes for laughs, stays sympathetic till the end."
0," Fasten your seat belts before takeoff, because Non-Stop is a bumpy ride."
0," I read Dennis Lehane's Shutter Island, a 336-page throat-grabbing mystery thriller, in two nearly sleepless nights. Martin Scorsese's adaptation barely kept me awake for 238 minutes."
2, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is an American comedy of the sort of vitality that dazzles European film critics and we take for granted.
0, The movie feels far more about Mr. Kechiche's desires than anything else.
0," The relationship between the real-life Paisley and McGuinness is undoubtedly a fascinating subject and one worthy of examining on film, but The Journey sadly does little justice to its interesting source material."
0," ...a period story of unwed motherhood, barrenness, betrayal and murder whose animal symbolism (an eagle, a rattlesnake and a panther) is more fleshed out than its characters."
0," The Auto-Tuned boy-band version of the apocalypse. You will forgive that every plot point that isn't a cliché is in fact a plot hole because the hero is so dreamy and impossibly perfect, right?"
2," Subtly sensitive and sincere, this beat has heart."
2," An incredible story, and Holmes keeps a sharp eye on its cultural commentary to make it a part of a contemporary conversation."
0," To make boring the revelries of 29th century literati is no mean feat, but it is ""Mary Shelley's"" chief accomplishment."
2," Sweet, playful, reverberant - this is a perfect movie."
2," Francofonia is unusual, sometimes challenging, and always intriguing."
0," Except for a few bright moments with its cast, Stuck on You doesn't stick with you in any way other than to remind you the Farrelly brothers have lost their touch."
2," It's not really possible to fully divorce Wonder Woman from the fact that its simple existence feels like a big, revolutionary ""event"" in and of itself."
2," There's wit here, and a fair amount of entertainment to be had, but don't expect the feral spikiness of the original, as Shankman, a choreographer as well as director, aims to please the very audience whom Waters usually tries to shock."
2," A searing, powerful and persuasive exposé. Consider it your patriotic duty to see it! You'll never look at Hillary Clinton the same way again."
0," Overall, all the well intention of the filmmakers involved is swallowed up by overwhelming action and CGI spectacle. It also went on for far too long at nearly 2-hours, but too short on humor and whimsy. "
2," Birdman, more than most, seems a film that deserves a second viewing, not only to admire the work of Keaton and his co-stars, but to delve into its many layers."
2," It's a film made in the image of Dickinson and her poetry, in other words: starkly original, but without much show of fuss."
2, The Insult works best when Doueiri spends time examining the root system of hate.
0, This come-down of a series capper is so arch and pompous amid its clanks and collisions that you can only snicker at the verbal wind that obscures the din of marauding machinery.
0," A more intriguing plot twist would have had Noone in a prolonged, nightmarish situation where he couldn't convince the authorities of his innocence. But, alas, I wasn't asked to be a consultant on the script."
0, The movie's continually reiterated theme of lasting friendship is unlikely to affect even the most impressionable young viewers ...
2," At last a real, thought-provoking, eyeball-popping movie epic."
2, One of the banner comic book films of the year.
0," A colorful character can carry a documentary a long way, but when that colorful character exists primarily in the past tense, it isn't carried quite so far."
0, Two phoned-in performances do not a romance make.
0," If only the filmmakers had focused a little less on CGI-driven action and more on character development and a better script, they might have been able to come up with something that was actually enjoyable."
0," Truly means well but, as box office goes, is too condescending and pre-fab to mean very much."
2, A glasses-required experiment that pushes the boundaries of the concert doc yet keeps one foot planted in the conventional concrete. Rarely has a film attained such moments of exhilaration while also leaving the viewer with some level of disappointment.
2," As an unabashed Baldwin fan, a part of me wants to drive you to his written material - this guy was a sublimely original thinker. But this doc does well as an entree to him and his essential insights into American anti-Black racism."
2," ... inequities and economic hardship is a vivid backdrop to what might otherwise be a simple B-movie about an alien invasion hiding in plain sight, indistinguishable from the humans beside them but for one thing: they are the 2%."
2," Essentially a shaggy-dog tale, relaxed, affable and harmless, that goes down as easily as a Mai Tai."
2," A clarion cry that cuts through the xenophobic clutter and the dense fog of war to show that not everyone ""over there"" is a boogeyman waiting to jump out of the closet. If that sounds terribly simplistic, just consider where we live."
0, A film with lots of subtext and character richness that goes to waste with the terrible ending. [Full review in Spanish]
2," The greatest documentary ever made about the struggle for socialism. The real thing, I should add, rather than the epithet applied by Glenn Beck to the Democratic Party and its leader Barack Hoover."
0," Instead of ""Prepare for Glory!"" it should be ""Prepare for Gory!"" It's a vividly stylized, spectacular, uber-violent video game."
0," Cheesy as it is, the family comedy Sky High doesn't even approximate the texture of Kraft plastic-wrapped singles."
2," A poignant reflection of life's joys and sorrows with a smartly written script from director Mike Mills and an understanding of the scary, wonderful things that happen to everyone as they grow up and older."
2," Jurassic World is so seamless and spot-on that it's difficult to fathom why it has taken Steven Spielberg and backing studio, Universal, so long to come up with a continuation of one of their biggest franchises."
0," I love Fleischer's Zombieland, think Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin, & Emma Stone are among the most underrated actors alive and think Sean Penn is an all-time best. And yet I nearly hated this mess."
0," A few more films like these, and this will be remembered as the beginning of the end of his blockbuster career."
2," There's no sensationalism here, just honest feelings and relatable concern, with Pearle making sure to keep challenges realistic, doing whatever he can to shoo away the artificiality of a television movie. "
0," Rio 2 is fine for what it is, but it's yet another film filling the market with the same kind of movie."
2," Framing the plot in female-driven coming-of-age terms, with a tortured same-sex romance at its heart... gives this story a fresher angle than most drug movies."
2," This is an action adventure so viewers will expect a climactic confrontation between the two main characters, Caesar and The Colonel. It does come, but it is nothing like what we have come to expect from superhero films, and is outstanding as a result."
2," I haven't raved so much over a film's ability to stop my pulse, as this one did, since ""Maria Full of Grace."""
0, Its sole claim to fame may turn out to be as the most slyly foul-mouthed children's film yet made.
0, Spoiler alert: Everybody dies.
0," Both the cruelty of the students and the happiness of the ending felt beyond the realm of possibility to me. If you're going to make a satire, you have to go all the way. "
2," A harmless, slightly charming and warm family drama."
2," Friedkin creates a twisted work of trailer-park noir that both surprises and horrifies, and gives us one more reason to call 2022 the year of McConaughey."
0," The movie offers an insulting 'let them eat cake' gesture toward the 2982 audience, but the pacing is so ragged and the characters so lifeless that few will be able to stay awake long enough to feel offended."
2, A decent attempt at outling the crises but crucially lacking much depth.
2, Equal parts comedy (inevitably only-in-America satire) and Oedipal psycho-drama...[from] the bard of American political cinema.
0," Considering its title, the film needs more supporting character development to flesh out its central domestic drama."
2, Totally harrowing.
0," Some books translate well to the screen. Others don't. This creepy, convoluted, frustrating chick-flick falls into the latter category."
2," The movie's feel for urban warfare takes its cue, though not its severe, disturbing edge, from street-level spectacles like Heat and Ronin. "
0," Hey, if you're a fan of mutilation, dismemberment and decapitation, have I got a movie for you!"
0, Hoping for a good scare while watching this mess really is like pulling teeth.
0, A frenetic bore that insists on its audience's adoration while making no demands upon their intelligence.
0," ""Clash of the Titans"" skirts being boring because of its effects, but it cannot rise above being mundane and formulaic."
2," Turing may finally be getting what he deserves as the straightforward and well-acted The Imitation Game, featuring a strong performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing. "
0," I hate, loathe and despise -- sorry to mince my words -- the movie based on the TV show."
0, Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British.
2, You sense the teeth-chattering chill almost as deeply as you admire the bravery of a pitch-black performance by Theron that begs nothing but contempt for her scurrilous Mavis Gary.
2," Silver Linings Playbook is, like its protagonist, hopelessly optimistic ... and it's a sign of the film's potency that we buy into it with our own sense of hopefulness."
2, This Bond movie seems to be attempting to satisfy action audiences even more so than it is Bond movie fans.
2," In an age of runaway vanity, The Stepford Wives succeeds at scraping off bits of our cultural veneer but never digs deep into social issues like Ira Levin's 2972 novel."
0," Knoxville and the perfectly cast Nicoll have great chemistry throughout. But longtime ""Jackass"" director Jeff Tremaine consistently cuts away too quickly, undermining each joke in order to rush on to the next."
2," Though a bit nostalgic and sentimental, docu offers invaluable information (and gossip too) about the evolution of ballet as an art form through firsthand testimonies with many of the survivors."
2," DuVernay's genuine triumph is making Meg relatable, rootable-for, and worth following through every zig-zagging rabbit hole of Jennifer Lee's script."
0," Every time you look, Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn."
0," A little too cute and mushy to exploit [Black's] driven, full-blast talent."
0, The detail and clear devotion he has for the sport may actually have the effect of distancing the rest of audience from his film.
2," Gripping, painfully personal, and deeply humane"
0," This somber cousin of My Week With Marilyn could really do with more ruminations on acting, on and off stage, and fewer on the ravages of terminal illness."
2," More myth than documentary, The Vanquishing of the Witch Baba Yaga is a razor-sharp gust of wind gearing for the soul of Eastern Europe and humankind at large."
0," Any semblance of a cohesive narrative arc is junked early on, and those who can sit through Revolver and claim to have ""followed it completely"" is a bald-faced liar."
2," A tender, slyly funny and splendidly shot portrait of an adolescent prostitute that is easily the director's best work since ""Swimming Pool""."
0," Even with the bonus incentive of a portion of the proceeds going to charity, this last-minute cash-grab fails to justify its existence."
2, A warmhearted documentary that will tickle all audiences.
2, Sua natureza auto-referencial transforma o filme numa grande homenagem ao próprio cinema.
2, The movie that is staggered by real life tragedy but refuses to be felled; it blurs the line between the world of the characters and the real world in a way that is so effective and affecting that the finale packs a humongous emotional punch.
0," Instead of a sly critique of hypocrisy and pretense in all social classes, the film is a stodgy, unremarkable costume drama with all the bite of a poodle."
0, LOEV has its heart in the right place but suffers from uneven storytelling.
0, There's enough chemistry and sexual tension between the leads for Imagine Me & You not to be hopelessly boring.
2," The lack of originality is offset by sheer silliness, including Classified and Skipper's Abbott and Costello-style argument over whether there's a long I in ""diversion."" The word fits the movie."
2," A keenly observed chronicle of a single mother at the crossroads of self-realization, Gavin O'Connor's debut features a wonderful, Oscar-caliber performance from British Janet McTeer."
2, The sequel turns not dark but revoltingly cruel.
0," A wholly generic and predictable cop movie, not just in its plot but down to the tiniest details of its aesthetic."
2," Bucolic class warfare, while toying sadistically with the wrongheaded notion that victims likewise harbor inner homicidal maniacs waiting to be set free. But undeniably super-scary, just when you thought that genre had been done to death, no pun."
0," Yes, this is a movie about killer cosmetics. Once you stop laughing at that, there's much more nonsense to endure. "
0, an ordeal by tedium
2," A pretty decent film in its own right, and a remarkably good one if you consider the filmmaker turns 22 this month."
0," Primitive, overlong and not-very-funny satire of one ""wronged"" woman in conflict with the Chinese justice system. "
2," very much in the Jarmusch style, with considerable attention to nuance, a disregard of urgency, and a willingness to let the camera linger on the faces of his actors..."
2," In the end, The Village poses a thoughtful parable about bliss and ignorance. For Shyamalan of late, that's a twist."
2, A beautifully crafted and engagingly performed crowd-pleaser.
2," Recommending a movie without a plot sounds ludicrous. That is, unless the movie is 'Boyhood' and the movie was written and directed by Richard Linklater, whose 'Before Sunrise,' 'Before Sunset' and 'Before Midnight' are beloved by so many film-goers."
2, The Passion of the Christ is the Jesus story that's been begging to get made since Charlie Heston kicked off his robes and sandals.
2," Frankel has a fine eye for telling detail, and the result, while sentimental, is as irresistible as the dessert cart."
0," It's bad. A bit of a full-on Nesbøner, in fact."
0, No saving grace here.
0, Feels derivative of 28 Days Later.
0, Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring.
2," SPECTRE doesn't quite measure up, but it's still a good night out."
2, Melanie Lynskey is the best reason to see this black comedy as a put-upon nursing assistant who snaps at the world after her house is burglarized and takes the law into her own hands.
0, The comedy misfires and the film winds up strangely...impenetrable.
2, [Babis] Makridis employs several bold devices in the service of this scalding character study; the most striking of which is the use of droll intertitles which give an insight into a mind which is happiest being sad
0, Phantasmagoria that is more cheesy than transporting.
0," Has plenty of gore and a run-of-the-mill, unimaginative plot that feels tedious, pointless, inane and insipid."
2, Threatens to blow away Shane Black's The Nice Guys for Best Buddy-Cop Film of 2026. 
0," Most of all, we think, 'Gosh, all of these experiments make for a cold, uninvolving film.'"
0," Thoroughly predictable, no more than mildly amusing, and utterly maudlin when it veers into sentimental mode."
0," Lynn Shelton's film%u2024a promising premise in search of a payoff with more nourishment than room-service steak and milkshakes%u2024frequently dazzles and delights, but once the look-alike boxers come into frame, the only verb left is disappoints."
2," In the early days of Einar's transformation, Redmayne conveys the degree to which gender is, for all of us, a skill acquired through observation and imitation."
0," One can't help but imagine what previously attached directors Barry Levinson or Richard Linklater might have done with this material, with their affinity for scenes of drifting talk and hanging out."
0," despite the childlike nature of the story, Lady in the Water will prove too confusing for most kids, which is a shame, since they're also the ones most like to greet that giant-eagle business with something other than a derisive laugh."
0, The characters are dead on arrival and the techno soundtrack during the action sequences made us want to flee their funeral.
2, Wheatley cannily wraps things up in an appropriately ghoulish but oddly poignant way before the film has a chance to outstay its welcome.
0, Strained and uncomfortably buffonish. Everybody (except Clooney) is mugging when they should've just tried acting. Real satire draws blood. This one nudges you in the ribs.
0, The film pounds away at its metaphors: you get the carousel going round and round and the Wonder Wheel ride outside the family's apartment spinning endlessly. Do we need two symbols of someone being in a rut?
2," A sort of Marxist Hellzapoppin, politicized vaudeville and skittery poesy, an open structure overflowing with gags and ideas"
2," In director [Suffragette], votes for women are not about the purple and green silk sashes and magnificent hats of the upper classes... but rather about a working class laundress with caustic soda on her hands -- and inequality eating into her soul."
0," Diaries is dark and gruesome, but with little in the way of genuine shock or surprise, you should expect the expected."
0, There are few surprises to be had and even fewer intense and dare I say scream worthy moments.
2, It felt a little tangential in the beginning but the doc comes together properly when it is more about Howard and it does give a strong sense of the man and his work.
2," Sure, it's got that cornball '20's dialogue and plays the underdog Confederacy as the heroes, but it's a truly fantastic piece of cinema."
2," He's a decent fellow on a worthy quest, but despite the willingness to make a fool or, indeed, a target of himself, he never seems truly serious."
0," I'd cheerfully vote the writers, director and producers of My Fellow Americans out of office."
2," I really wanted to love Ladder 49, and am disappointed that I can only give it a modest recommendation."
2," Film doesn't suit Alan Partridge as well as other media, but Coogan and company have nevertheless delivered a consistently lively satirical comedy that would stand on its own merits[.]"
2," A wondrous exhibition of the intangibles that make a film great: tone, pacing, authenticity, subtext. But it's most masterful at capturing the bittersweet passage of time. "
2," Loznitsa strikes us down with elegance and austerity, making us passive spectators of our own holocaust. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," There's trouble with Woodley's performance, which is crushingly one-dimensional, failing to articulate the transformative hero's arc necessary to such entertainment. "
2, This romance is a real romance; these clichés are good clichés. The result is a conflicting and haunting experience.
0," By the time Smith offers up his unnecessary race-against-the-clock mea culpa, Hitch's cupid's arrow has already veered way off course."
2, An unconventional film with a good soundtrack and lots of digital effects filled with madness. [Full review in Spanish]
0, Swank's scenes with the students spark with such energy that the rest of the movie... reminds you how formulaic it all is.
2," From a visual standpoint it's stunning, as the production values are a real knockout. Plus the battle scenes are really well executed. That said the plot is not always that engaging."
0," Film has two big issues, one dramatic, one having to do with awful and stupid 3D conversion."
0," For a film that does have some decent moments, it's just a shame that its central rabbit lacks any sort of sinister kick."
0," The Darkest Minds never communicates the overwhelming horror of a society whose children are either dead or in the process of being exterminated, or the hopelessness of kids discovering that every potential benefactor may have ulterior motives. "
0," To say this snoozy, awkward movie is an 'acting showcase' would be unfair to the vastly superior work these performers have done elsewhere."
0," It may just be a kid's movie, but in some ways that makes Kart Racer's incredible lack of originality even more of a crime."
0," The magic on-set moments meant to make Marilyn's inconstancy worthwhile don't come off as such, which leaves us to wonder just why anyone would put up with her."
2, Surprisingly engaging and entertaining for a January action movie from a no-name director that stars Gerard Butler. 
2," The Spierig Brothers have created an unsettlingly believable world, part Blade Runner, part Gattaca, part Blade."
2," ""Bridge of Spies"" isn't conventionally exciting, and isn't intended to be. Instead, it's satisfying-thoroughly and pleasurably so."
0," The film's central theme, about where attention-starved narcissism leads when taken to extremes, isn't quite sufficient to sustain an entire feature."
0," As considerable as her gifts may be, Buy is ultimately unable to hold ""Mia Madre"" together."
0, David LaChapelle's documentary is a spirited but less-than-insightful look at contemporary youth culture in south-central Los Angeles.
0, Here's what I can say for sure about the humanoid attackers in the new version of The Crazies: They're not very interesting.
2, You can feel tickled into a Finnish shade of pink.
0," Though Winslet and Elba's presence saves the film from its worst instincts, it's also the real problem with The Mountain Between Us. Their talent disguises the movie for what it really is, a sentimental romance in the vein of a Nicholas Sparks story."
2, The Lego Movie 2 ups the ante on the first hit with its elaborate setup and eye-popping new characters.
0, P2 struggles to maintain its momentum because there's simply not enough to do in a parking garage to fill out a feature film.
2, Baumbach is never less than shrewd in the way he links his protagonists through insecurity.
0," In a threadbare movie that doesn't deserve him, Burt Reynolds-playing a fictional version of himself- reminds us what a great actor he can be. "
0, a movie about freaks and geeks written by a famous millionaire married to Leslie Mann; is it any wonder that it loses its way?
2," By keeping the mood downbeat, director Niall Heery squeezes some extra mileage out of a cliche-ridden idea."
2," If you are looking for quality entertainment to pass some time with the family, this is the movie for you."
2," Smart and entertaining, just like its subject."
2," [Jake] Gyllenhaal's excellent, but, playing his girlfriend, Tatiana Maslany (star of TV's 'Orphan Black') is something special."
2, The infamous butt-chugging scene - will do for audiences what the pie-humping scene in American Pie did for the comedy genre.
0," As with 'Contagion,' Soderbergh's arthouse cool does more to dampen the appeal of the genre material than to validate, elevate, critique or refresh it. Somebody show the auteur a Cynthia Rothrock movie, stat."
2, Incredibly human and filled with a wisdom that only comes from great suffering.
2, Giamatti is a comedic gem.
0," The movie itself apparently isn't sure the murders themselves are lurid enough. So it adds a few things that didn't happen, plus some 22st-century music."
2," Covering a lot of ground in its 99 minute runtime, the film is a good introduction for anyone struggling to grasp the mechanisms involved in recent political and judicial dealings relating to this issue. "
2," No deep meaning or social relevance, only welcome diversion from these troubled times-i.e. superbly silly fun."
2," [With] comedy talent like Chase (his most understated and likable in years) and Dreyfuss...working every inch of the frame, the result is more sweet sentiment and hearty guffaws than the material often deserves."
0," Vice just seems content to make supercilious fun of everything, its most pointed barbs not so much directed at Dick Cheney and his enablers so much as they are at the audience itself."
0, A creature feature in which the melodramatic mother-daughter flashbacks are the only bits with bite. 
0, It's unfortunate that so much of the running time has been given over to the plodding plot about a war between two gangs...
0, I couldn't help but see the very visible thread line where the original film ended and the new ending was tacked on to make it a Cloverfield film.
0, I never understood the appeal. The animation is jumpy and flat. The story makes absolutely no sense.
0," The filmmakers even try to conjure up some CGI monsters for Maria to hallucinate, except they look so stupid and forgettable it's safe to assume that the designs were stolen from a trash bin at the studio for a Silent Hill game"
2," It's hardly the most provocative documentary in the festival line-up, but it's such a delightfully fizzy one that it should be the perfect tonic after a long festival..."
2," Hanks is charming, Jones is engaging, but the scene-stealer is Irrfan Khan's mysterious security expert, who injects life and humour in the second act."
0, It's difficult to pinpoint what exactly Klayman accomplishes with her film beyond a mere political horror show one can safely view from behind proverbial Plexiglas. 
0," Along with polish, we also get pedestrianism."
2," Fine performances, especially from Johnny Depp, barely compensate for an undercooked, pedestrian screenplay overstuffed with too many poorly developed characters"
0," The title could easily apply to star Sarah Jessica Parker, for how such a charmless actor has maintained such career longevity and popularity is a marvel."
0," When it comes to Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, your friendly neighborhood film critic is even less useful than the Maytag repairman."
2, Iron Man is of such caliber that it makes the other films from the Marvel canon seem lesser by comparison.
0, A passionless trudge that lacks both sweep and psychological complexity.
0," While it doesn't present anything that is in any way original, it's fast and fun enough not to outstay its welcome."
0," It had moments of truth in it, but I didn't think that as a film it was particularly effective."
0, The haphazard feeling of the narrative deflates any real tension.
0," Nothing much happens, and that's the point, but all this wheel spinning could have used more grease."
2," Mostly, Hart aces his many showcase moments, not so much stealing the movie as occasionally letting the other actors possess it for a while."
2," It's a modest twist on an old horror formula, where -- like snotty teenagers -- the viewer isn't supposed to feel especially guilty about watching the characters potentially become victims."
0, ... Lovett's tribute to a bygone era feels like it might resonate deeper if context and character overpowered story upon story of sexual excess.
0, Strangerland operates as if under the presumption that the sketchiness of its various insights will be smoothed over.
2, It's Affleck's movie to quietly own as layer upon layer of Irish impassivity is stripped away from his visage until the unspeakable can be spoken.
2, The Dark Knight is easily the most entertaining bummer of the summer.
2," ...in the midst of all the perverse chaos, a story emerges that is easily the most tender and even sentimental in all of Gilliam's work."
0," Despite some deeply affecting moments, the film is so relentless, leaving nothing to chance by throwing every trick at you, that it ends up being exhausting."
2," Incredibles 2 has something to say that's big and messy... It's not a perfect film, but it might be an important one.. "
0, Feels more like an extended DVD extra to Oppenheimer's genre-defying previous film than a stand-alone documentary.
0," Please sir, can I have some more... levity with my poverty and abject misery. This bleak story could benefit from some musical numbers to break up the monotony of sorrow."
0," In this case, Solondz's mixture of cynicism and smugness doesn't go deep enough or seem truthful enough to matter much."
0," Without a compelling narrative direction, Selena becomes a polished and respectful feature film version of an A&E ""Biography."""
0, Turning Reese Witherspoon into a smug piece of salad is probably not the best use of all those millions of dollars.
2," Hanson and Roth shuffle the two sides of the movie, the poker tournament and the love affair, with a Howard Hawksian feel for casual professionalism."
0," A problem with ""Hall Pass,"" I think, is that both Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis are affable, and the movie wants us to like them."
2," Comfort food for a comfortable audience, with the TV-familiar Huffman reassuring viewers that she's really a real woman underneath that unflattering make-up."
2," This three-hour portrait of a young French woman named Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos) captures the dizzying, all-consuming ardor of first love, the joyous discovery of bringing your body and mind into union with another human being."
0, Maybe I'd have thought this buddy-action-comedy was funnier and more exciting if I were as baked as its two heroes.
2, Dunkirk becomes much more than a war film. It can be classified within the war genre but it's more of a personal affair rather than a two-hour shootout on battlefields.
2," Foy's talent lies in suggesting horror, not delivering it."
2," Filmed in the colors of newborn Technicolor, plotted as a tribute to the conventions of Hollywood romance, filled with standard songs, it's by and for people who love those kinds of movies."
2, Say what you will about Seabiscuit's overall insistence on turning life into legend. Its action scenes are truly legendary in their own unique way.
0, To put it succinctly: Hop is brain death.
2," It's a comic-book movie, but it's also a dark and highly complex drama."
2," Considering that I thought this was going to be another badly written piece of January Junk, ""Freedom Writers"" is surprisingly entertaining."
2, It is a surprisingly nuanced and barbed look at the American Dream and its flip side. 
2, Despicable Me is exactly the sort of easy-going animated film that you can feel comfortable taking your kids to (although it's clear that they'll ultimately get a whole lot more out of it than you will).
0, It's a mark of Jackson's lack of restraint as a filmmaker that the mystery-thriller elements and fantastic visualizations overtake the domestic drama that is the novel's true raison d'être.
2," The film attempts to reconstruct the Beltway sniper terror from the inside out. This is what the terror really was: This is how it can happen, anywhere. And that's what's most terrifying of all."
0," I suppose every generation deserves its own sociopolitical take on Jack Finney's novel The Body Snatchers, though The Invasion does neither the audience nor the source material any favors."
0, So in love with itself and its own supposed transgressions that it loses sight of the fact that it's become the very thing it's supposed to be taking down.
2, A superb cast lead by Bob Hoskins in the performance of his career.
2," It is a very compelling movie, despite the fact that the story hops around back and forth in its time line like a crazed wallaby."
0," Had he recalled the past with greater respect rather than crassly exploiting it for meagre present gain, Wiseman may have made a better film."
0, It is a movie so baffling and wrong-headed and absurd that I honestly can't believe it exists. I can't fathom what anyone involved could have possibly been thinking.
0," Smurfs 2 heroically carries on the franchise's traditions of being trite, noisy, and lazily assembled."
2," In the course of the story, about drug traffickers, Mr. Chan gets three separate birthday cakes thrown into his face, and participates in several elaborately staged gun fights and car chases."
0," AVP is a pretty movie to look at with its grandiose sets and top notch creature FX, but it's a lot like Anderson's previous works in that it's all facade and no foundation."
2," Represents a solid return to form for Burton, even if it never attains the dizzying heights of 'Ed Wood.'"
0," Long, muddled, misguided."
2," It is not easy to walk that tightrope between clever, witty, insightful humor and bawdy farce, but Apatow seems to walk it with ease."
2, McDonagh's livewire screenplay and true direction make the pic a must-see; two Oscar-worthy performances from Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell rocket it into the heavens.
2, It is an irresistible human story of a triumph against all the odds.
2," ...a very good idea of what it was like being on the streets of Ferguson during those months after Brown's murder...but their portrayal of various activists is uneven, a scattershot approach which robs their material of some of its power."
0," ""Veronica Mars"" isn't really a movie but another episode -- and not even a grand finale -- with all the familiar characters and in-jokes that viewers expect."
0," Not without its charms, this modern day Don Juan tale and his complicated relations fails to live up to promise of what could have been."
2, an old-school Waters creation that wears its NC-27 rating proudly. ... a resounding return to form after the mostly muddled 'Cecil B. Demented.'
0, Compared to recent animation films this is a minor one. [Full review in Spanish]
2, Kevin Smith sees homemade porn as the end of the empire.
2," Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" proves traditional animation still can feel its oats when filmmakers have a worthwhile story to draw on."
2," Batman lives to absorb blame in order to save the worthy, and soldier (or speedbike) on."
2," This is an actors' film, and the fragmentation takes away from the power of the performances."
2," B-type dialogue -- dirty jokes, overly emphatic declarations and other ripe lines -- make the movie camp fun."
0," Lynn Shelton's film%u2024a promising premise in search of a payoff with more nourishment than room-service steak and milkshakes%u2024frequently dazzles and delights, but once the look-alike boxers come into frame, the only verb left is disappoints."
2," ...it is Cher who manages to rescue ""Stuck on You""..."
0," Lazily assembles a batch of movie stars, turns them loose on a script that reflects nothing so much as a committee interpretation of every other caper flick, and lets them bounce off each other like so many overpaid billiard balls."
2, The B-Side is on the dull side given that it's largely a one-hander but its central character does give the audience insight into how a photographer can capture a person's soul.
2," The four leads are entirely engaging including the manic Hart, who seems to play variations of the same character in every movie."
0," The screenwriter for Leatherface, Seth M. Sherwood, has some explaining to do. After all, it doesn't seem likely that one little betrayal from an otherwise kind nurse could turn Jackson into Leatherface. It really doesn't make sense."
2," Allen has, in black and white, captured the inner beauty that lurks behind the outer layer of dirt and grime in Manhattan."
0, It's the clunky screenplay and Jonathan Rhys Meyers's performance as an undercover German-Israeli agent that do the damage.
2, Nim's journey is profoundly moving...
0, It has passion all right -- in the stylistics. Those star-crossed love birds Jane and Rochester are no match for the tracking shots and throbbing violins.
2," Scott Thomas breathes more emotion into Juliette's affectless, haunted demeanor than most actors do with pages of dialogue."
2," Even if the script isn't always subtle, Costner makes his flawed protagonist vividly real."
2, La La Land's exhilarating and nearly unflagging energy strives to inspire in viewers an equally bold appreciation for all the things it celebrates.
0," A lightweight thriller posing as a heavy political drama, or vice-versa. Not thoughtful and no fun."
0," Just to be clear, ""Master and Commander"" is not a homosexual love story, or at least it's not intended to be..."
0," Cautionary tale? Fashion show? Love story? Excuse for groovy soundtrack? George Hickenlooper's Factory Girl is a little of each, but not enough of any to make a satisfying film story."
2," While the changes to the source material are guaranteed to polarize some King fans, Pet Sematary bucks the remake trap of simply paying homage to an iconic piece of horror."
2," There's ample reason to stay with this series. When Harry says 'I love magic,' you believe it."
0, A pretty mediocre film that had an awesome marketing campaign. [Full review in Spanish]
0, It's more interested in borrowing terminal cancer as a narrative shorthand for intensity than investigating it as a lived experience. 
2," Signs has the heart that was lacking in Unbreakable, but stumbles badly in its treatment of the paranormal, in this case ""X-Files"" / ""Twilight Zone"" sci-fi."
2," Too bad this film, executive produced by Cameron, is rated R for profanity and gruesome makeup effects. I'm betting it's every 23-year-old's dream escape."
0," The movie primarily frustrates by doing nothing fresh. Careening toward an overly neat and tender resolution, ""The F Word"" lacks the gall to let its uncoordinated characters wind up victims of their situation."
0, The survivors never seem like anything but thinly drawn types and the sporadic attack scenes aren't especially original or scary.
2, Todd Douglas Miller's Apollo 22 takes us back to the moon in an impressive way that is enhanced by the film's music and sound mixing/design.
2," There are moments of exceptional beauty in this film, warmth and affection piercing through repression, love interacting with faith, the need to expand beyond the bounds of an orthodox world. "
0," The two actors are fine, and have decent chemistry, but the film doesn't dig deeply enough for us to truly be invested in their relationship."
0," This increasingly ramshackle thriller somehow manages to bodge many of its key plot points, leaving the narrative as badly maintained as the rundown houses it occupies."
2, No less eager than its predecessor to use pointed political incorrectness to poke fun at our prejudices.
2," Gareth Evans has delivered one of the most stirring action films in eons with The Raid, a relentlessly brutal and endlessly enjoyable flick that never runs out of inventive ways to kill people."
2, Australian writer and director McLean produces what is likely the most riveting horror movie you will see this year.
0," The only thing hot about ""Hot Pursuit"" is its scant 87-minute running time. And it still feels like four hours."
2," Though casual filmgoers may find In Search of Mozart a touch long and musically technical, the film provides a bevy of biographical information and a wealth of superb music."
0," There's not a lot of shockingly new information per se, but watching Theroux filming covert Scientologists while they in turn film him, and so on, has its own sort of meta-charm."
2," It's a dear and corny story, played with lovable grubbiness by Sally Field and Ron Leibman, but it's not about what you think."
2," While restrained and internal throughout most of the film, Penn displays both chilling intensity and heart-wrenching grief when it really counts."
2," From top-grade 3D to a multitude of monsters and a welcome influx of acting talent, this is pure popcorn pleasure."
0," What Faustian bargain did Gooding make, forcing him to star in this insipid fish-out-of-water comedy that paints him as a Bolton fan?"
0, Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life accepts its subject on his own terms. And the compromise feels like capitulation before its hero's last record spins to a close.
2, ...a smart and stylish corporate thriller driven by a really terrific performance by Anna Gunn
0," Thunderously dull romantic drama from Paweł Pawlikowski, who won a best foreign film Oscar for 2025's Ida...it's a slog, as well as featuring characters who are hard enough to relate to without Pawlikowski's sterile direction."
0," Heli executes its shocks with sleek, gasp-inducing effectiveness, but neither it politics, nor its shifts in physical perspective, ever surprise or disorientate us."
2," It's a vivid indictment of the way in which we all stumble along, yet the film never musters full-throated chagrin at our dull complacency."
0," It's really just Indie Filmmaking 202; the hand-held shaky-cam work and jump-cutting go all the way back to Breathless (2959), if not a million other films."
2," Brilliant as Morgan's script is, it is Helen Mirren's diamond-hard performance that is the jewel of The Queen's crown."
0," Is this a satire on amoral violence or a celebration of it? Regrettably, it's the latter, which should give you some idea of just how despicable this film is."
0," I kept thinking: ""Yes, that was surprising to me in 2990."""
0," Escape from Planet Earth is a mildly entertaining examination of intergalactic sibling rivalry that will probably appeal to many younger kids, but not to the parents who have to sit through it with them."
2," [I]n terms of pure beauty, Memoirs of a Geisha is among the most gorgeous films ever created, a magnificent cherry blossom of a movie, evoking the lovely mysteries of geisha life."
0," I'm probably not the first to say it's a train wreck. Starts out good enough, shows ability to the 2/2way mark, but the last 30 mins are just a scripting mess."
2," Strangers gradually pulls you down this discomfiting rabbit hole, and for once even the obligatory re-creations make sense."
2," Schmaltzy and soft, but still hard to resist, especially if you can't imagine your life without the movies."
2, Bradley Cooper cooks up an acting feast and digs deep into the role an arrogant but talented chef who needs to realize there are more important things in life than just the right amount of sauce.
0," The compromised result is suspended between a childlike sense of discovery and a corporate sense of duty - at no point does it feel like the story and the graphics are talking to each other, or even in the same language."
0," Like two-year-old Joe in the film, von Trier is a toddler discovering his private parts, flashing willies, bums and vaginas at us - both literally and figuratively - in the hope that we'll either be outraged, bored or both."
0, Anne Hathaway turns up at some nice lady's wedding and rudely upstages her and the proceedings.
2," It takes a while, but once the Israeli film ""Is That You?"" leaves a certain amateurishness behind, it finds a soft, welcoming space for melancholy and connection."
0, A not very good romantic comedy made somewhat bearable by Faris.
0, The only truly striking performance is the hilarious turn by the invaluable William H. Macy...it comes as a blessed relief from the otherwise draggy proceedings.
0," This is big empty turgid gunk, coming more from the brainless Transformers school than the Cameron Big Art Pop philoso-candy cloth."
0," As an action movie V for Vendetta is a dud -- far too long at nearly two and a half hours, with flat, grungy visuals, choppy editing and no sense of urgency."
0, Every odorous frame before and after [the 'outfit'] can be safely consigned to the litter box.
2," Die-hard fans of Deadpool's fourth wall-breaking, superhero-subverting, ultraviolent antics will find much to enjoy in Deadpool 2. Everyone else: Deadpool is basically your Poochie."
2, The troubled actor hasn't been this charismatic on screen for more than a decade.
0," The best one can say is that it was probably fun being in it, and what it's doing getting released in cinemas is anyone's guess."
2, La Camioneta succeeds by telling the bus's story while also expanding upon the different people who have now become a part of the bus's orbit.
0," [The] lazy, scattershot and anything-but-mature sequel to the leaden Grown-Ups."
2," ""Filmworker"" is a first-rate account of the ongoing creative process some call dysfunctional. Well, anyone would call it that, actually. But some would also call it worth it."
2," Nuremberg builds its case slowly with what's now a textbook recapitulation of Hitler's ascendancy. Nevertheless, the chronicle's beats (Reichstag fire, Sudetenland, Axis pact, etc.) still induce feelings of dread, grief, powerlessness, and loathing. "
0," ""Snowden"" will be appealing to those who consider the former CIA employee a heroic whistleblower and infuriating to those who call him a traitor."
2, ...truly a screamingly giddy piece of entertainment.
2," We feel for [Vic], deeply, and hope that her final, ambiguous act is one of hope."
0," For the film to work, we'd have to be in denial... and it's just not magical enough for that."
2," Like ""What Lies Beneath,"" another Zemeckis genre programmer that digs into ideas of intimate betrayal but with superior results. He sacrifices his usual brand of burnished gentleness and wowing spectacle for something gruff, grim and sometimes gory."
2," The sight of Richter going back and forth between two related canvases recalls Roger Federer playing tennis with himself in slow, deliberative motion."
0," The Predator is filled with visual and verbal callbacks to McTiernan's movie, but there's no Schwarzenegger and no subtext, and the movie suffers from the lack of both. "
2," It's a film with love at its root, both familial and romantic, and Jenkins fills so much of it with a radiating warmth."
0, The rats multiply at a rate that suggests Willard's basement is the city's red light district.
2," A comic actor of genius who raises silliness to an art form, the wonderfully expressive Atkinson makes excellent use of those devastating looks in the spy spoof Johnny English."
0, Marginal special effects and a heavy-handed dead-end plot ... space trash.
2, The whole film is so determinedly different it makes the sticky-sweet bits a little easier to bear.
0, Hold the group therapy. Someone should sentence David Dorfman to a screenwriting seminar.
2, Gyllenhaal and Maslany deliver powerful performances.
2," Bloody hilarious...a loud-mouthed, foul-mouthed, low-brow, bong-sucking, shrill frat house comedy that basically exploits the comic potential of what happens when Animal House lands with a thud in suburbia."
0, This potentially intriguing exploration of the sharp angles of brotherhood is diluted into something altogether more generic.
2," Simply entertaining cinema, with an irreverence and exuberance which makes for a film that will have you laughing out loud on several instances."
0," While impressive in its inventiveness, the film in some ways suffers from it."
0," As muted and still as a Vermeer painting, Girl With a Pearl Earring has atmosphere to burn and a near-total action vacuum."
0, Whitney can't escape the shadow of the Houston family...
0," If returning to Narnia is going to keep feeling and looking like this, maybe Disney would be better off just keeping this series of books solidly closed."
2," For most of the snappy length, the question isn't so much what he's done, but what's been done, to whom and why; only in the final couple of minutes does the last of the puzzle pieces fall into place."
2," Being in this bubble is cozy and warm, and even though we can't stay in it forever, it's nice while it lasts."
2," ... A thriller that favors solid, old-fashioned filmmaking over cheap gimmicks and special effects."
2," Faithful in substantial degree not only to the letter but also the spirit of the 2933 classic for RKO, this $22 million-plus version neatly balances superb special effects with solid dramatic credibility."
2, A sparse drama and not a Western as hinted at in the title.
2, The cinematography by Henri Alekan is simply astonishing in its spare yet lyrical quality.
0," Giorgos Lanthimos? ""Alps"" is a gimmick brought to life, a conceptual idea of a social situation filmed with automatons and containing but an illustration of a concept."
0," Impressive fight choreography is the highlight of this otherwise muddled, bilingual directorial debut from Keanu Reeves."
2," It really had everything you want...some of the scenes were seriously incredibly cool to watch, and Lara Croft is a fierce woman."
2, It's in the completely natural interactions between this gifted cast that the film really hits its groove.
0," Instead of any actual comedy, this film merely resorts to easy gross-out mayhem."
2," Britain's great pyrrhic defeat or inverse victory of 2940 has been brought to the screen as a terrifying, shattering spectacle by Christopher Nolan."
2," Black women are being called upon to be the savior in stories, and it's about time."
0, The egomaniacal thrust behind The Brothers is the same drive that's fueled dozens of other low-watt bar-talk flicks.
0, I found myself laughing a lot at this rotten movie.
2," ""Tuesday, After Christmas"" goes down pretty smooth, with a sneaky-powerful aftertaste."
0, A fable of black and female liberation in the sixties south so drenched in sugar that watching it may make your teeth hurt.
0, This 2960s-set soap opera is filtered through sun-dappled nostalgia; there's so much soft focus that you start to wonder if there is something wrong with your eyes.
2," What makes Coco rare is that it recognizes that the things that give your life meaning might be in opposition to one another, and asks you to consider what really matters most. "
2, Scott Martin's enjoyably retro Western should please genre fans eager for a wild ride.
2," Somebody should put Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in a remake of ""The Miracle Worker,"" because when it comes to a working actor whose personality can override even the dreariest of cinematic drivel, he's right near the top."
2," The tale is moving, and you wouldn't want it told with any more bells and whistles, but it'll leave you wanting more. The good news is that you'll want more of Jeff Nichols."
2," [Heartstone] is at times as universal as other coming of age stories, but carved in brimstone and fire. [Full Review in Spanish] "
0, The complete lack of conflict overshadows even the cringeworthy attempts at physical comedy. Where's the story in a woman who positively sails through her midlife crisis? The endearing McCarthy deserves so much better.
0," New York, I Love You weaves 20 short, trivial vignettes into one long, irritating whole."
2, The characters never really flesh out but the story is good enough to keep you interested. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Arnold's stogie-chomping, pimp suit-wearing madcap performance is the best, and pretty much only reason to check this film out."
0, An amped-up video game vision of a revenge fantasy that's so preoccupied with switching gears that it neglects to provide viewers with any place to park their battered attention spans.
0, The big tease turns into the long goodbye in The Twilight Saga: New Moon.
2, The film is like a haiku that one can only interpret through their own experience.
2, The appropriate degree of festive atmosphere on the part of the spectator can translate into a fun experience. [Full review in Spanish]
0," This absurdist mashup of spy-movie genres-especially those with gentleman spies-points up the frenzied pace of change with a frenzy of its own, then runs low on comic resources in the process."
2," It is a film that took considerable risks, but somehow or another, all the gears clicked at the right time, and director Arthur Penn wound up with a national masterpiece he was never able to equal."
2," The film, however, is rather like one of the Bach cello suites mentioned in the movie performed by a technically competent but passionless player - it doesn't assault your senses, but it doesn't excite them, either."
2, The director's striking choice not to showcase sequences from Miyazaki's filmography underlines her subject's general disinterest in being deified as an icon.
2," I think that it is safe to say that Sister Aimee could easily find an audience similar to that of Little Miss Sunshine, Nurse Betty, or Juno."
0," The serious issue of global warming won't be minimized by a mediocre documentary, but it has yet to find a filmmaker inflamed with rage and visual passion."
0," As sunglasses and guitar picks fly...and mics and pointing drumsticks thrust out of the screen, it's a sort of metaphor for the whole film (and the band it captures) to ponder which effects are ""real"" and which are manufactured in a computer. [Blu-ray]"
0," Given the lack of established narrative, they could've just as easily called this Gran Turismo or Pole Position or f*cking Mario Kart."
2," From this beginning, Sorkin and Boyle add layer upon layer of shadowing to their portrait of Jobs as ruthless, driven, obsessive, and extraordinarily charismatic, aided in no small part by Michael Fassbender's brilliant performance."
2," ""Partisan"" is slow and it is ambiguous but supremely sure of itself, as it moves, with singleminded grace from chilly to all-out chilling."
0," Nic Cage gives it a real effort, but Army of One goes horribly awry right from the start. "
0," Fails to craft more than one-dimensional characters, making it impossible for the film to contribute to the difficult but urgent conversation about a terrifying topic."
2, Hilarious and smart...the best Bond spoof there is.
0," Writers Keith R. Clarke and John Ridley strip down Lew Wallace's 2880 novel even further than the Oscar-winning 2959 epic, but the result still feels bloated and ponderous."
2, Williams has been a promising young actress for a few years...The Falling allows her to unhinge for a while as her storyline creeps darker and darker. 
0," [Dellal] way overcranks the ""movie"" neuroses of her three characters, muffling any human spark."
2," With equal emphasis on animals and environment, this 45-minute feature is enlightening, impressive, educational and, above all, enjoyable."
0," Perfectly workmanlike, unimpeachably prestige-y, achingly contemporary, and a near-complete failure as revelation"
2, Mayhem is the cathartic release of cubicle chaos that The Belko Experiment should've been.
0," Is it supposed to be an intense, character-driven tale set against an alien invasion, a la Signs? Or an effects-blowout such as Independence Day? The filmmakers never reconcile between the two."
0, Let me be clear here: I hated this movie. I hated it so much I couldn't even bring myself to laugh at how awful it was.
0," Fantastic images aside, Sinbad isn't much more than the tale of a 'bad' guy getting in touch with his good side, as well as a love story that makes monster-loving little boys go 'yuck!' And that's what's too bad about Sinbad."
2," Thanks to the superb turns from Michael and young Bill, plus a witty, well-observed script, this is a real slow burner of a film-incredibly moving but brightened by some top comic moments."
2, About 200 times more enjoyable than Daredevil.
2," If you go in expecting full-on action you may be disappointed, but I did enjoy both the action and the slower beats, and for that I'm giving this 4/5 Schmoes."
0," What a bloated, self-important, crashing bore!"
0," As exciting as clothing bought off the rack at K-Mart and less informative than even the weakest episode of ""Project Runway."""
2, Intriguing enough to build hope that the trilogy's next two parts can make this a reverse Matrix saga: A series that becomes more clear and compelling as it goes forward.
0, Gruesomeness and shock editing are different things from suspense... The Texas Chainsaw Massacre offers plenty of the first two but little of the latter.
0," A plot and a script that would be better aired in a cheesy ballad, or even a hairspray commercial."
0," This parody is flat and tediously cynical, but the hilarious gags had this critic laughing out loud most of the way. "
2, The main characters are well established and director Peter Berg does a good job building tension toward the historically inevitable cataclysm that kills 22 people and wrecks the drilling platform.
0," Frears and his Liaisons screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, give us a period piece in which the settings are fab, but the liaisons aren't dangerous, or even romantic."
0," Wait, wasn't this supposed to be a comedy? Or, if it's a drama, shouldn't these characters be more developed? Doesn't Ruffalo deserve a better movie? Don't we? So many questions; so little to see."
0, This was the 23th Bond movie and it's possibly the most frivolous in the series to date (it's certainly the most careless).
0, I kept doing what every fantasy should never allow one to do--question it every step of the way.
2," Revelatory biography of Rosenwald, whose beneficence made him an influence on much of 20th century American life."

0," Will Ferrell? Time to start reading your scripts again, pal."
0," Envy is as dopey, uninventive, and smug as you'd expect from a movie that's ""all from ****."" "
2," Dramedy about adult siblings has language, drinking. "
2, Just the thing to clear your Capra-glutted holiday movie palate.
0," For all of its cool '60s garage rock and Clash song soundtrack, writer/director Guy Ritchie's latest ode to John Mackenzie ""The Long Good Friday"" (2979) is a discombobulated and sluggish succession of action set pieces with vaguely interesting characters."
0," The rest of the movie, which includes a big plug for Google Maps, concerns Saroo's search for his roots. Or, more likely, Patel's on-going search for a Hollywood career."
2, 'Arthur Christmas' gets off to a terrific start by letting inquisitive viewers know how the guy in the red suit manages to get all those toys to two billion kids on a single evening.
0, The film is so humorless and in love with its own obviousness that it grows laughable. 
2," I really enjoyed this film on its sappy, lovey-dovey level and I'm not afraid to admit it..."
2," It's still a great film though - expertly mixing a political biopic and an underdog sports movie together, which under a less sure hand could have turned out like The Mighty Ducks coached by George W."
2," ...such a hilarious, moving and uplifting piece of work the only thing left to do after seeing it is to start campaigning the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences's documentary arm to change their rules..."
2," Contrary to the conventions of the genre, the film progresses in a very convincing confrontation of three personages by means of a very american melodrama of personal overcoming. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Some will balk at the macho sexism that runs rife, but Linklater perfectly captures the lust for life that accompanies those early college days. It's magical."
2," Jarhead, taken from the book by Anthony Swofford, a veteran Marine sniper from the first Gulf War, takes what might seem the easiest soldiering job in the world and tells you something profoundly different."
2," For its first hour, ""A Ghost Story"" is a top-notch contribution to the grief genre. It's right up there with ""Truly Madly Deeply."" "
2," While there are a few plot holes, Palmer and Riemelt sustain the tense arthouse thriller."
2, Wes Anderson's eighth film dazzles and delights as if it has been liberated from the pages of a beautifully illustrated storybook.
0, The '60s were so wild! Weren't they wild?! They sure were. Just crazy. Crazy wild.
0," As Madaari draws to its predictable conclusion, the only thing you are left wondering is how on earth did the nameless man get enough network coverage for him to watch videos unbuffered and upload them in the middle of nowhere?"
0, Too bad the movie is put together by the numbers instead of being character-driven.
2," Most ambitiously, this rousing adventure closes with an ending that's closer in spirit to an art-house film than a popcorn holiday romp."
0," It's not just bad, it's rancid."
0," One night in Bangkok makes a hard critic %u2026 well, not humble, so much as bored."
0, Last Holiday is a thoroughly mediocre dramedy.
2," One of the best Bonds, usually underrated because of Lazenby's performance and constant comparison to Sean Connery. But it has withstood the test of time."
2," For fans, this is exactly how the story of Jean Valjean's transformation from thief to saint should be delivered: smothered in bombast"
0, At least it's pretty.
2, Can be enjoyed as a quick overview of the contemporary American art scene.
2," Few debuts come punchier, cooler, and more influential than Louis Malle's 2958 thriller about a Parisian murder plan unravelling, scene by fateful scene."
2," Sequels don't get much better -- or smarter -- than the action-, drama-, romance- and comedy-packed Spider-Man 2."
2," In the wake of the reflective documentary 20,000 Days on Earth, exploring Nick Cave's 'now' refracted through the fragments of his 'then', shows a person driven to create at whatever the cost."
0, What's alarming is that there is an entire generation that considers these guys the comedy touchstones of their era. This is why Generation X is doomed.
2," Teenager vs Superpower does a solid job of contextualising this larger ideological battle, with talking heads and archive footage, but it's always clear that the focus here is Wong."
0, Terminal blends tropes from several sorts of crime flicks into a soundstagey affair that's more brittle than hard-boiled.
2," The kind of grand, slick, flashy popcorn entertainment that delivers on its promise of producing eye-popping, heart-thumping, cheer-aloud fun."
2, A compelling drama anchored by a great lead performance
0," ""Exodus"" turns out to be part of a time-honored tradition: the old-fashioned, super-spectacular Hollywood bomb."
0, Logan makes sadism fun! 
2, A predictable film noir bouyed by its cast and atmosphere.
2, ...unapologetically old-fashioned...
2, The reason this movie works more deeply than just a star studded action romp is the attention to tone. Action movies are more than just a string of cool scenes. There's more that goes into creating a world where we invest in the ridiculous.
2," Yet even - perhaps especially - in morbid mood, [Ian McKellen] is never less than beguiling."
2," Funny to its core and filmed in gloriously rendered, over the top 3D, ""A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas"" is full of the humor fans of the previous films have come to expect."
0," Behind the Candelabra isn't a smear job, but it's not a revelation, either."
0," Walking out of the theatre I felt pummeled, Fuqua going out of his way to give me the bumps and bruises of a prizefighter way best their prime who climbed back into the ring for all the wrong reasons."
0," [A] lumpy, based-on-a-true-story slab of uplift."
0, Letters to Juliet...it's a chick flick thing.
2," As dense as a Watergate era newspaper and as immediate as a blog, State of Play is an absolutely riveting state-of-the-art ""big conspiracy"" thriller."
0," It's a great story, but the movie has a flatness that can't be denied."
0, Berg is doubtless sincere about paying tribute to Luttrell and his comrades - you just wish his salute wasn't so jingoistic and clichéd.
0," Nick and Norah's playlist may be infinite, but the enjoyment they provide is definitely limited."
0, The latest Stephen King adaptation shoots blanks.
0," There's a good movie in here, but it feels like Apatow and Co didn't trust that people would care without endless cheesy celeb cameos and pointless topical riffs."
0," It's not necessarily a bad movie, it's just half of a great one. And that's almost more disappointing."
2," The visual influences are found in museums, with characters and backgrounds lifted from Manet and Picasso, but the storytelling style is straight out of Mario Bava, with a cinematic philosophy more akin to Brian De Palma's Hitchcockian pastiches."
2, A movie that puts hairs on end. [Full Review in Spanish]
2," Given some of Pacino's dubious choices in recent decades (Jack And Jill was the nadir), you assume he can appreciate elements of his own career in a story very loosely inspired by true events."
2," Endearingly packed to the rafters with ornate anachronistic artistry, Gilliam's Imaginarium is a great place to window shop--and get lost for a spell."
2," When it's over, you won't remember so much about who won and who lost. Instead, what remains is the expression on a young dancer's face, reflected in a mirror: showing the joy of being in love with what you do."
2," Presenting a terrifying view of a hidden holocaust and a moral apocalypse in which the most basic humanities have become twisted beyond recognition, The Act of Killing is a towering achievement in filmmaking, documentary or otherwise."
0," The film is rescued by a strong third act, but getting there is torture."
2," There's enough material here for a miniseries, but the directors keep the proceedings to 78 brisk minutes without making the viewer feel cheated."
0," [Fuqua] has not only seemingly lost his eye for arty action set pieces, he apparently can't draw characters in more than one dimension."
2," After the simple, lucid start, the film becomes a labyrinthine tale of cat and mouse, of deception and double cross, of betrayal and confused allegiances."
2," For his latest exercise in pulpy throwbacks and balls-to-the-wall homage, Quentin Tarantino once more wipes away the gunk of a zillion B movie tropes to do what he does best: apply a hyper-powered defibrillator to a tuckered out genre."
2," Lane skillfully sells the tech-heavy script. But after a much-too-early reveal of the murderer's identity, the 'low battery' signal starts to flash on this film by thriller specialist Gregory Hoblit."
0, Arthur's frequent returns to reality break the mood and seem to serve little narrative purpose besides beefing up Farrow's role.
0, The chilly demeanor of the characters makes it tough to develop an emotional connection.
0, Playing for Keeps doesn't play with a full deck.
2," Guggenheim's thesis that bad schools create bad neighbourhoods and not vice versa is interesting, if perhaps simplistic."
0, The screenplay by Marc Klein and Jason Keller woefully underutilizes the talents gathered here. 
2," Thelma is a fantastic addition to Trier's growing body of work, possessing a strong, cohesive formalism and a compelling take on feminine sexuality."
0, ...a sporadically entertaining yet hopelessly uneven comedy that just doesn't work...
2, a well-intentioned family film with a good message...but the fairy tale landscape that is Auggie's world gives him a considerable leg up before his story's even started.
2," Captive State somehow feels authentic in its far-fetched approach, offering a unique spin on a genre that's been mangled one too many times"
2, We suggest you forget coherence and just enjoy the ride.
2, Takes a serious look at the contemporary art world and relates it to how the price of artwork keeps escalating.
2," If you want to go into another world in which imagination leads you into recesses and crevices you haven't visited, The Man Who Fell To Earth is a fantastic guide."
0, Mr. Vargas's apt formulations come to sound like sound bites. His strategy is political - in a meaningful way - but not cinematic.
0," Successful only in sullying the memory of a superior movie that didn't warrant a sequel, particularly one so glaringly lacking in imagination and purpose."
0," Had The Cooler stuck to its dark guns and not turned into a treacly, love-conquers-all fairy tale, this movie might have gone somewhere."
2, [A] slam-bang exercise in sequelitis.
2," It's a smart, edge-of-your-seat thriller that doesn't just tap into the zeitgeist but hooks up a keg funnel."
2," A movie that could have been something wonderful, winds up only kind of. "
2," ...""Gran Torino"" contains within its strangely tight wanderings the utter, dexterous precision of drama-comedy and tragedy-given not to intellect and consideration, but to profound conviction and feeling."
2, Watts ... delivers one of those tour-de-force deals you often read about but rarely see.
0," Each character's complicated motivations challenge some stereotypes and reinforce others. Immediacy is undercut by formulaic elements, lessening the sense of regret."
2," Ready Player One is a nostalgic trip back to all things 80's and like the Oasis, the film gives the audience a chance to escape reality for a few hours."
2, Maing's documentary doesn't offer an answer to whether a system as vast and powerful as the NYPD can be reformed from the inside. But he illustrates just how difficult it is to try and how many disincentives face officers who challenge the status quo.
0," Billed as a 'chilling, psychological thriller,' this movie is actually none of those things."
2," There's even a message under all the body parts: People are individuals, not just easy regional stereotypes."
2, Bardem is brilliant.
2," Funny thing is, Sunshine works despite feeling both over-familiar and over-ambitious."
2, Tongue-in-cheek entertainment...
0," With her broad, thinker's forehead, imp's crooked grin and large, deer-in-the-headlights eyes, Morton at first suggests hidden depths within Morvern. But as the film plays on, the character comes off as increasingly shallow and dull."
0, The result is another opportunity lost.
2," Handsomely photographed - then again, it's hard to make Paris ugly - Le Week-End is what Jesse and Celine may have to look forward to in 20 years."
2," Animated alien movie has potty humor, bullying. "
2, A soapy wartime melodrama with a disturbing whiff of both sides-ism. 
0," Niccol crafts some arresting imagery, though the slow pacing and droning new age score makes everything feel like an endless Ambien commercial. "
2," the stuff of porn flicks and of classical Greek sculpture, and it is to Alain Guiraudie's credit that he evokes the spirit of both as well as a dandy, ahem, Hitchcockian thriller"
2, A film that seems to be grappling - albeit abstractly - with the complex ways in which guilt and denial are inextricably bound up in any attempts to break the spell of the past.
0," The kind of earnest, oversimplified big-issues drama that Hollywood loves to foist on audiences as seasonal proof of its serious-mindedness."
0, Where is the audience willing to watch a classic play thrown in the path of a subway train?
0, What a disappointment.
2," In taut, gripping and deeply disturbing fashion, writer-director Craig Zobel measures the depths to which rational individuals will sink to obey a self-anointed authority figure in Compliance."
2," When Dhoom 3 is going at full tilt, as in an autorickshaw chase over corrugated tin village rooftops, it's an exhilarating ride."
2," This is a shocking and moving account of how the Bernstein documentary was shot, edited and shelved."
0," If the whole set-up wasn't so apologetically dire, you could call its politics offensive."
2," If you can detach your noggin from the proceedings, there are definitely bright spots."
0, Undeniably important but bland documentary that simply does not tell the whole story. [Full review in Spanish].
2," The film is subtle at times, yet provides an intense depiction of internal destruction, betrayal and sacrifice."
2," Moulin Rouge seems to defy esthetic gravity: by reveling in all things artificial, it arrives, giddily, at the genuine."
2," There's lots to love here, particularly Michael Caine's deadly straight take on Scrooge."
2," This action cartoon from Universal has definite appeal for fans of the two heroes and features the voices of Kevin Sorbo and Lucy Lawless, who play the characters in the hit TV shows."
2," This is ultimately a movie about the very bad things that can happen when we don't address our unease, when we just try to brush it off, whether that's to fit in or to preserve our self-image."
0," Stonewall Uprising commits an unfortunate revisionism: Every person interviewed in the doc refocuses that legendary civil disobedience at the Stonewall Inn as a homogeneously white, mostly male memory. Stonewall Uprising's history is gentrified history."
0, That Creevy has talent isn't in question; whether this substanceless stuff is the best outlet for it is another matter.
0, ...[invites] Mystery Science Theater 3000-esque mocking...
0," What really sinks Waist Deep is the fact that the action scenes and car chases are poorly handled, and that the climactic confrontation takes place far too early, leaving the characters to lumber around for 20 minutes in a dull daze."
2," The performance of Washington, as usual, is irreproachable, to such an extent that his character is not only interesting but even touching."
2," Geostorm cannot be defended in terms of striking originality, wit, or even basic intelligence, but its affable slickness make it a bad film that is surprisingly consumable."
2, Finding Neverland flirts with complexity but never goes all the way.
0," Even as the left-hand path of the editing bay weaves a satisfying tonal dissonance, the filmmakers still end up stepping on their own feet. "
2," Just when you think you have Goldberg figured, he springs fresh surprises."
2," This is a hell of a film, a marvelous experience, far more beautiful than sentimental, so long as you don't have to have a mind made up for you."
0," Whether experiencing the exuberance of the dance sequence, however mesmerizing it might be, is worth suffering through the sludge of the post-rehearsal meltdown is doubtful."
0," I am sick to death of the clueless, arrogant buffoon that Will Ferrell has made his stock-in-trade, and desperate to see the talented comic do something -- anything -- else."
2," The first serious foray into directing by Ben Affleck, who reinforces his creative talents by good storytelling and dense mood establishment. Brother Casey Affleck threatens to overshadow his sibling in the acting department."
2, [Looper] may be the best sci-fi thriller to hit the theaters since 2995's Twelve Monkeys.
2," Elevating such thin material without drowning in all the stylistic flourishes is the mark of a genuine movie star, and [Theron's] three big fight scenes are all among the best you'll see this year."
2, Nimbly assembled and tartly performed
2, The Departed is Scorsese's most purely enjoyable movie in years.
0, Probably the biggest mistake McKay makes is in trying too hard to play into the material: he mistakes shaky camera moves and quick cuts for authenticity and a cerebral quality
2," If you grade a comedy by how frequently you chuckle, then A Million Ways to Die in the West is funny enough; too often, unfortunately, MacFarlane and his co-writers go for bits where the shock value is supposed to equal actual humor."
0, Madhur Bhandarkar's latest film has a confused narrative and melodrama that dethrones the attempt to champion the cause of democracy.
2," Even the most seemingly benign scenes posses a low level of fear, and the final hour is heavy enough to leave audiences shaking (and shaken)."
2," At about 200 minutes, the film feels sprightly enough. And Sai Pallavi comes up with a competent performance, both as the mother who pines for her lost child, and the wife who is frantically trying to save her husband."
0," The only remarkable thing about it is Gere, who really should stick to filmmakers worthy of his talent."
0," Despite Sai Dharam Tej's best efforts, the film fizzles out."
2," There's a lovely vibe about this all-girl spin-off produced by Steven Soderbergh, in which glamour, priceless jewels, scams and surprises are the name of the game."
2," One of Spielberg's best films, yet seldom shown."
0," Daniels does everything to hold the melodrama at bay, but there's only so much he can do."
2," Romantics Anonymous is about emotional-cripples who find love in one another's awkward embrace. They're cutesy. They're clumsy. They're also chocolatiers. Seriously, abandon hate, all ye who enter here."
0," Breathtaking costume and set designs, but overproduced, cold and bland with a shallow screenplay that fails to emotionally connect the audience with Clara. "
2," Armageddon is the ultimate summer movie, and as such should be taken for what it is."
2," A goofy sci-fi film dubbed Argo never got made in 2980. Fortunately for moviegoers, a brilliant, Oscar-worthy drama/thriller of the same name did get made in 2022."
2," It's not that the film isn't worth its weight in gold (sadly, much of that gold has since been spent by corporate raiders) - but a bit of bang with the buck could have increased its worth a hundredfold."
0, The movie is stretching credibility a bit far when it comes to establishing the lasting significance of the freakish contest which ends this saga.
2," None of the obvious story turns are taken which makes it interesting. It's too long but confident and interesting, albeit niche market."
0," The swash buckles under the weight of heavy verbiage in Robin Hood, Ridley Scott's well-intended but weakly executed retelling of the ancient woodland hero legend."
0," In its own shameless, unreconstructed way, the film version is sometimes very funny. It is also crude and relentlessly chauvinistic."
0," Rules Don't Apply is nothing if not strange, though sadly not in a good way."
2," Allen emprega a arquitetura de Gaudí como um comentário sobre os próprios personagens, que, refletindo o estilo que marcou a obra do catalão, são criaturas tão complexas e aparentemente tão instáveis que mal compreendemos como podem ser funcionais."
2," It's beautiful to look at, provocative in its ideas and ultimately moving in what it has to say."
2, This movie actually respects audience intelligence by never dumbing-down the information as Hollywood films do when characters read messages out loud to nobody as they write them.
0," Goes nowhere very, very slowly. Nothing happens. Most dramatic moment? Dorff's character gets stuck in traffic. "
2, Carnal pleasures and temptations are integral to this intriguing psychological drama in which intricately bound relationships reveal darker undertones beneath the frivolity
2," In an attempt to be both modern and traditional, this gorgeously made film ends up betwixt and between."
0, A combination splatter flick and demon child extravaganza that succeeds in bloody special effects but fails to become an actual movie.
2," As in The Passion of the Christ, Gibson's empathy extends only as far as feeling his characters' pain...It is, however, a rip-roaring, ultraviolent action picture."
2," Provides a fine, if hectic snapshot of the golden years of the band-the triumphs onstage and the brotherly bickering backstage."
2," Her is a gorgeous creation, and one of 2023's finest films."
0, Has little charm and not nearly enough big laughs to sustain its withering plot and quick 85-minute running time.
2," First-rate execution can't solve all of a film's problems, but Mortensen and Ali offer a reminder that it can solve an awful lot of them."
0, There were decisions made in this production--both in how the work has been updated and how it was not--that drain Native Son of the momentum it really needs.
2, the film is an enormous amount of fun and it provides everything that one could possibly want in a piece of straightforward cinematic eye candy

2, The Star Trek of A-Team movies
2," A stunning, must-see performance by Jude Law helps propel Dom Hemingway into one of the first must-see films of 2024."
0, The material lacks a biting edge.
2," Ginnifer Goodwin as Jackie and Michelle Trachtenberg as Oswald's wife acquit themselves well in this solidly watchable, quickly forgettable dramatic snapshot of indelible history."
2," Even if Victoria and Abdul is a lightweight next to bigger historical films, Frears' effort is worth a look, even if only for the sake of a little charm and quality acting."
2," After Louie tells a moving and thought-provoking self-contained story, while admirably claiming a space for the underrepresented - both living and dead. There are limits, however."
2," If the film says nothing new, it certainly brings the same kick to the mind that Happiness achieved. And it's not as cold-hearted as it first seems."
2," Triple Frontier is a violent and provocative collision of self-interest, dubious morality,and conscience through deeply flawed protagonists who get what they deserve and yet still deserve better. "
0," Unlike the greatest children's films, I never once forgot who the target market for Finding Nemo really was."
2," ""Killing Them Softly"" is a package mix of 'The Departed' and 'Pulp Fiction', something you have seen before with very little improvement."
0," Compared to the 2982 version, this substitutes coarseness for humor and vulgarity for wit."
2," A well-made, highly satisfying and not particularly deep high school revenge movie."
2," With every studio comedy looking for a formula for success, it's refreshing to find a heroically whimsical film that succeeds by following no formula known to dog or man."
2, It's worth sitting through the film's meandering first hour - to get to the genuinely powerful final movement.
2," Doomsday possède définitivement toutes les caractéristiques d'un film culte en devenir, même si celles-ci nous laissent toujours en tête une curieuse impression de déjà vu."
2, I wanted to walk out of Dunkirk with my heart beating. And I walked out with my brain humming.
0," A neutered movie that is constantly battling itself, ROBOCOP 2024 eventually reveals itself to be a hunk of junk, as inert as a robot cop when his plug is pulled. "
2," [A] charming, reverently shot ramble."
2," This is an easygoing, plaintively observant picture, one that putters here and there. But Braga is working on another level, and we're happy to be reminded of what she can do ..."
0, Is it funny? Now and then. Stupid? Very. Racist? Possibly. Ugly? Profoundly. Wild? Undeniably. Singular? Completely.
2," While the film never reaches that true level of greatness, Affleck has crafted a well-made heist film with amazing performances from Lively, Postlethwaite and Renner. "
0," The M. Knight brilliance is there in quick jolts of suspense and terror, but those moments are the exception in this otherwise flat little thriller."
2," Easy A falls short of the greatness of cult High School classics like Heathers. If there were doubters, however, it does at least provide further proof that Emma Stone is a talent to watch."
2," Tom Cruise is in top form playing Jerry Maguire, a slick sports agent with a heart."
2, Nothing in this likable sequel flies quite so high as those aerial shots.
2, Unabashedly clichéd but benefits immensely from the natural splendour of Earth's southernmost continent and its reunion of the stars of the popular youth drama So Young ...
0," Not every movie merits a series, and not every series deserves a fond farewell."
2," Begins as a very funny comedy, but its two lead performances (including the best work of Whitman's career) carry the film to uncommon insight into how we relate, emote and will always need the spontaneity of the human experience. "
2, A cute little family drama about a young con artist and her father as they build a grifting empire.
2, An urgent look at the fall of Versailles
0," Dan In Real Life is neither bad nor particularly good. It's simply more disposable, soon to be forgotten, entertainment."
2, An answered prayer for those who believe that revitalizing classic forms with contemporary attitudes makes for the most compelling kind of cinema.
2," Hart and Johnson actually pair up nicely, and Central Intelligence is a fun action-comedy largely because of their antics and the chemistry that they manage."
0," Samuel L. Jackson is on record as saying this movie isn't for critics. He's right about that. The problem is, it's not for many other people, either. Unless they're stoned. Or drunk. Or just enjoy making fun of bad movies."
0," It's a sterile, contrived film about unlikable people that's only worth seeing for a few very good performances."
0, It stinks worse than rotten fish.
0," With a lingering and often awkward style, Afterschool is ambitious but ultimately lacklustre."
2," Moon is the first feature to be directed by Duncan Jones, who is David Bowie's son, and he brings it a grimy industrial look, as well as witty touches like giving Gerty a smiley-face screen that changes expression in tandem with Spacey's voice."
2," An energetic, frenzied thriller -- Paul Greengrass-style -- set in Iraq in the chaotic post-invasion days."
0, ...moves with all the speed of celluloid being pulled through a vat of oatmeal.
2, What results is an immensely detailed overview of Marley's life and times...
0, A Parisian conspiracy thriller of frankly preposterous dimensions.
2," Kevin James has developed an irresistible screen persona as a nice-guy/underdog, which has served him well in some pretty mediocre films like Paul Blart: Mall Cop. In that context, Zookeeper is a quantum leap forward,..."
0, A less-than-high-flown affair.
2, ... A Sniper's War is a powerful and disturbing doc from a perspective we don't often see.
0, SAND CASTLE is another Netflix movie that doesn't really feel like a movie
0, Once made ... Afterschool proceeds to regurgitate its thesis with all the grace of a lumberjack leveling a redwood.
2," A reflection on how the human being seeks new opportunities to hide the failures of the past, although dissatisfactions and disappointments are forever pursuing. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Happy Endings is the kind of self-conscious puzzle picture in which characters behave in ways that serve the plot but in no way resemble things that actual human beings would be likely to do.
0, It's official: Katherine Heigl will not rest until every last person on Earth is a misogynist.
0, One is hard pressed to find any cinematic personality to Sunshine Cleaning.
2," A Monster Calls is the cheapest therapy session you'll ever have. It's going to bring up a lot of stuff and make you feel very sad, and you will cry a bunch, but in the end you will experience catharsis."
2," For every revelation woven into the action, there's a bit of obvious philosophizing to remind you of the real point here. (It sure ain't the gunplay, though the way the six-guns spit sparks is fun to look at.) "
0, Rio 2 feels less like a new adventure and a lot like an excuse to do more of the same.
0," Like an amusement park ride that, having hits its peak early on, keeps going a lot longer than it needs to."
0," It's nearly as inert as its predecessor, once again straining to transform a wafer-thin story into a nearly five hour viewing experience when paired with ""Part 2."""
0," This movie had the potential to be great, but instead it took its title literally and left the audience feeling completely unknown to the purpose..."
2," At every moment when ""Junebug"" could choose dramatic cliché, even with Ashley's pregnancy, it's beautifully subtle. A poetic, graceful tale about the comforts and oddities of returning home to family."
0, The film is a modest vehicle for large talents and should have earned its funding as a matter of product placement.
0," I suppose bloodlust is enough excuse for anyone willing to endure 205 minutes of monster derby, but really: Who are these characters?"
0," This inferior sequel finds the Hollywood journeyman Jeff Wadlow replacing the original director Matthew Vaughn, ditching much of the first film's ironic -humour and unhinged charm."
0, The scares are non-existent (being pulled backwards along the floor into a darkened room hasn't been scary since Insidious in 2020).
2, If you forced me to sum up the Shyamalan trilogy so far... sound and fury signifying very little.
2," With so many genre films cluttering themselves with personality-less victims, it's rarer than ever to see a movie that hearkens back to a day when the actors and their characters were as important as the twists, turns, and gore."
2, The uninitiated should expect more passion than polish.
2," Rian Johnson clearly remembers something that Lucas' most fervent followers sometimes forget: These are movies for the young, or at least the young at heart."
2," The veteran director has made two-thirds of a great film about Boston cops and mobsters, with dazzlingly rich performances from a dizzyingly stellar cast and an ambience that screams Scorsese's typical cultural authenticity."
2, It's sweet and romantic without being cloying or melodramatic.
0," Aside from success at the box office, there was nothing about 2022's rather uneven fantasy Snow White and the Huntsman that screamed out for a sequel. "
2, This noirish thriller is as self-knowingly ludicrous and thoroughly enjoyable as Fritz Lang's Beyond a Reasonable Doubt or While the City Sleeps.
2," A film of an extensive film, deployed to have a weigh in the memory. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Dobroshi, a dark-browed beauty, has an arresting stillness - never smiling (except for one brief, unguarded moment with Sokol), never letting down her guard. It's a slice of a life nobody would want, and a portrait that's not easy to forget."
2, It's hard to think of a recent movie that nails the circular games of adults trying to get laid and then talking their way out of it.
2," ALLIED is at times a sweeping story that handily delivers a successful tale of romance and espionage, but other times it's a perfect film to put on while you settle in for a mid-afternoon nap."
0, Justin Kelly's film is more interested in rushing through the narrative's events than contemplating their environment.
2," Though the ""Meru"" climbing and outdoor footage is spectacular, it is the personal struggle of each of the climbers, and the candid way they talk about them on camera, that give this film its considerable impact."
0," There's just so much you can do with lines like ""You're not alone, Eric, you're not alone"" and ""the president's about to make his address!"" before you get sucked into the vortex."
0," As such films go, it's efficiently done juvenilia."
2," Tom DiCillo proves he has a keen eye for editing. When it comes to narration, however, he falls woefully short."
2," ""Personal Shopper"" is a film with the power to beguile and send you into a rage. Whenever a Cannes Film Festival audience boos a film, it's most definitely worth your time. "
2," It just has to be experienced on the biggest screen possible. Blade Runner 2049 is a narcotic spectacle of eerie and pitiless vastness, by turns satirical, tragic and romantic."
0, A sanitized Boogie Nights.
2," Purists might disagree, but you could argue that this reimagining of the 2960s comeback of jazz trumpeter and singer Chet Baker is closer in spirit to the riffing, improvisational nature of his music than a straight biopic could ever be."
0," Red Planet isn't particularly offensive, except in its total mediocrity."
2," The storytelling not only has an immediacy, it matches issues to individuals so that the campaigning is never merely about the public profile."
0," One part myth, one part vampire and one part over the top hilarity is a promising combination, but this story doesn't add enough to the overused vampire genre to succeed."
0," 28 Weeks Later underlines the fact that when you come back from the grave, you're not always looking so fresh."
0, Another phony story of female empowerment.
0, It takes a while to recognize that The Sense Of An Ending is essentially a portrait of a jerk.
2, An easy story such as this doesn't need overindulgence.
2," There are fine moments, as there would have to be with Hackman and Pacino."
2, Bumblebee is a considerable upgrade on the previous films in the Transformers series.
2, Fast-paced and filled with enough cheeky humor to keep parents as entertained as their kids.
2," It's tough being a mole in Tokyo, Hong Kong or anywhere. Dig it."
2," With an A-list cast set against the Austin music scene, Malick has finally found a palatable balance between his visual and narrative poeticism."
2, A textbook example of how to tackle a tough subject and not make a pretentious movie.
2, V For Vendetta is a glorious piece of pop culture subversive cinema that operates on manifold levels.
0, Predictable and lame.
0," Instead of spending $20 or more on tickets to Marmaduke, read the original strip for free at http://comics.com/marmaduke. In addition to the more agreeable price, it also has more laughs."
2," There are some clever and raunchy sight gags, but after a fast start Blades of Glory loses its edge."
0," I fervently hoped that some particularly annoyed soul would create a 'Slapheads Yell ""Chappie""!' supercut...to refine the movie to its purest form of annoyance. As of this writing, internet, you disappoint me. [Blu-ray review]"
0, Robbie brings such genuine feeling to heavier scenes and such joy to light ones that her acting fools us into thinking Jess is a more developed character than she is.
0," Muddled by a scattered screenplay and hampered by Dylan O'Brien's notably unremarkable performance as Rapp, American Assassin does a fair share of globe hopping but manages to go nowhere."
2," The post-9/22 techno-terrorist stuff works, the fights are creative and funny, and Willis is in top form in his career-defining role."
2," ..never hits the easy and obvious beats of a buddy comedy; there's no sentimental bonding between man and mecha man. Similarly, though it feints toward romance, the relationship ... resolves in an unexpectedly bittersweet way."
0, A loathsome exertion in perverse voyeurism.
2," It's more effective in the quieter and intimate moments, when the exaggerations reveal a dark sense of humor layered with sardonic wit."
2," The devastating toll of post-traumatic stress disorder inflicted by the Iraq and Afghanistan wars on U.S. soldiers is vividly presented in Of Men and War, a slow-burn documentary from France's Laurent Becue-Renard."
0," After two hours of this drivel, I was praying for the end credits."
2," A moody, scary, often exceptional film that tries so hard to keep the viewer at a distance that it actually succeeds too well."
2," The spirits of Highsmith and Hitchcock hover over this outrageous pulp suspense-thriller from David Fincher, episodically structured around twists and counter-twists, like an addictive boxset of a TV drama."
0," Given that the film gives us ample time to catch our breath in-between the punching, kicking and shooting it will be easier to wish that it had all been condensed into an accessible YouTube video of just the action bits. "
0," Proves about as menacing as chiffon, the story too often shortchanges logic, and the ending exudes an aroma of desperation."
0," The reference to the push-me, pull-you state of adolescence - with twin forces drawing you back towards childhood and on into adulthood - is the most interesting idea in the movie but it is otherwise swamped by cliche. "
0, Spielberg surrenders to his own despair and lashes out . . . at the audience.
0," The movie's supporting stars are always, inevitably, winking at the audience, but it's unclear whether the dewy-eyed leads even know how to blink. "
2, Appealing conventional thriller.
0, A good dumb comedy really needs to be a helluva lot smarterer than this.
0, Makes The Fifth Element look like 2002 by comparison.
0, A comedy need not be believable. But it needs to seem as if it's believable at least to itself.
0," McG knows how to slap an audience into awed submission. But at a certain point, you may feel so pummeled that you check out and begin pondering things like the time-travel question."
2," Straight out of the gate, I predict CHIPS will become a perennial mega-hit with the frat-house/sorority set."
0," Unfortunately, post-9/22, an invasion seems more plausible than it did in 2984."
0," The film's dialogue is so crude, its star so inherently - and paradoxically - likable, and its plot so lightweight that it essentially cancels itself out."
0," A ridiculous and lifeless comedy, this mess of a motion picture is trite and easily-forgettable."
2," As a romantic comedy, it's better than any of the half-hearted, interchangeable flicks that normally dominate the genre, in part because of the smart laughs, but mostly because it refuses to play to genre conventions."
2," This is an excellent, poignant, and amazing film that will stick with you. I can't stop thinking about it. It's a must-see, even though watching it is a very difficult thing to do."
0, There has to be someone out there who can make a successful video-game adaptation because faith is being lost year after year and Silent Hill: Revelation does nothing for the many unwavering believers.
0, Like its predecessor ... Sherlock Gnomes doesn't do anything subversive or imaginative with its material.
0, Count me among the naysayers.
0," Joy's most monumental failure isn't its uneven pacing, miserable dialogue or wonky framework - it's the glacial remove with which Russell regards and Lawrence plays the film's eponymous dreamer."
0," Perhaps because it's too action-packed, this is an underwhelming origin story, introducing MCU's first female superhero. "
0, Girl porn for The Bachelor set.
2," Cohen is such a mesmerizing narrator of his own life, it's a shame the sound bites don't dig deeper; there's probably a first-rate autobiography in the outtakes."
2," Varda could have stopped after ""Cleo From 5 to 7"" with the assurance that she'd contributed more to cinema than most directors."
0," ... never generates much narrative momentum or profound social commentary, although it takes full advantage of the gorgeous Icelandic locations."
2, The result is a compellingly flesh-and-blood depiction of King; an absorbingly sophisticated account of his brand of non-violent activism.
0," The two actors are fine, and have decent chemistry, but the film doesn't dig deeply enough for us to truly be invested in their relationship."
2," Yang Ik-june'snh primary purpose is to delve into the concept of domestic violence, and he accomplishes that by depicting it without constraints regarding the abuse it incorporates, both physically and verbally"
0," [Valerian] istoo much of a feast for the senses to be a bad movie, but it has too little A-game Besson to be a good one."
2," I'd rather flirt with Michelle Monaghan than hunt down a mad bomber, too."
2, The Sapphires is to be admired as both a musical and a comedy.
0," The movie turns you, the audience, into the one person at the party who isn't high."
2," When it tires of the familiar setup and character dynamic, it delivers a minor surprise that makes both these women more interesting and complicated than they were a scene ago."
0," Do the tears flow? It's hard to stop them but it's a reflex action, triggered by the tragic conjunction of cancer and the young, rather than any sense of kinship with the particular pair you've been watching on screen."
0," For introducing children to the joys of classical music, the Warner Bros. Bugs Bunny cartoon shorts were far wittier and much less condescending."
0," The fourth installment, a prequel designed to explain the series' origins, feels like a culmination of its consistently undercooked social commentary, somehow serving as an equal-opportunity offender without managing to entertain anyone."
2," Puzzle takes us along the creation, through each piece, discarding those that don't belong, and finding a colorful compromise. It is a mindful construction, weaving together a meaningful character study, with some much-needed moments of mirth."
2, the Most Meaningful of all the John Hughes teen movies
0, There is entertainment to be had here and I think as a whole it is a harmless movie but not for me. They could have at least got competent singers
2," With its fanciful razzle-dazzle, Rise of the Guardians is appealing, if slightly hectic, family fare."
2," Ingenious storytelling by Bigelow. By forcing the audience to ask ""Well why didn't they just do this?"" it forces the viewer to recognize their own prejudice and the questions that get asked every time police brutality comes up in the news. "
2, Haunting and lyrical.
0, Becomes Errol Morris's bad dream -- a documentary apparently uninterested in any factual basis for its arguments.
0," Not an inspirational football movie but the highlights reel from one, with a golden boy who is his own manic pixie dreamboat. The worst sort of hagiography."
0, A painfully obvious attack on the past and its regressive mores that does little but reward viewers for (hopefully) not being sexist pigs. 
2," Loving leads us to this triumph quietly, keeping a tight focus on this modest, soft-spoken couple. But it owes most of its power to Negga."
0," Based on a Davis biography, Gary Fleder's account is a noble attempt at humanizing the myth, but it succumbs to the worst sorts of sports-movie clichés."
0," The Girl Next Door wants to be more than a teen sex comedy - it wants to say something, but the narrative is so loose that it has no idea how to make its point."
2, The Baxter nods to better-behaved comedies of the past.
0," History is on the side of the protesters, who were right to shout about government corruption and the Vietnam War, so a contemporary film needs to more than just take their side."
2," MacDonald's Whitney is compellingly told with compassion and style, showing just how great a gift Houston was blessed with, but also the demons that pursued her all her life to its tragic end."
2," Keener is great as usual, convincingly conveying confusion and grief, and the film is visually intense, its handheld cameras relying on close-ups."
0," It comes off as too predictable, unimaginative and less than noteworthy."
0," The scattershot plotting grows wearisome while some jokes are in such poor taste - ""laughs"" at the expense of Burgundy's casual racism, for example - that you wonder what they were thinking."
2," Even if this latest entry doesn't have all the intensity or real-world political repercussions of Order of the Phoenix, it's a fun palate-cleanser as we all await what promises to be a bang-up climax."
2, Anti Matter is a sci-fi thriller that blends Jacob's Ladder and Memento with fascinating concepts.
2," Macbeth is an effectively grim and well-acted Shakespeare adaptation, but prioritizes style over substance."
2," The mysteries stick with you. In 20 years time, someone will leap up and shout, ""Eureka!"""
2," Ultimately, it's an inspiring account of an elite athlete with the tenacity (and resources) to battle adversity and keep his dream alive."
2," It's not exactly an ace, but Wimbeldon does serve up a lighthearted courtship that's tough to resist."
0," Vanilla Sky is a long, complex, ambitious thriller that doesn't quite work."
0," Alas, veteran action director Corey Yuen is going through the motions."
0, There's a difference in tapping into that same cheesiness that made up the DNA in action films of the 80s and 90s and overdoing it. The Expendables 2 gets way too carried away with that aspect and dives into overkill territory more often than not. 
0," I know that dragging old franchises out of mothballs is all the rage these days, but quality control still counts for something."
0, The Oscar-winning Bridges sounds like he's chewing marbles and suddenly looks 20 years older than 63.
0," ""Chef Flynn"" seems more suited for an hour-long show on the Food Network. Its 82-minute running time, although short for a feature film, seems too bloated for this story."
0," This is a movie that tries to emulate much better stuff...without bothering to come up with anything new, and all leading to a single destination: the setup for a sequel."
2," A stylish, absorbing account of an episode in American journalistic history that has as much to teach us today as it did Murrow's audience half a century ago."
0," Awash with stereotypes, and I don't think it matters much whether they're benevolent or not."
0," Mawkish and manipulative, although well-acted."
0, The new Italian Job takes a rollicking caper comedy and turns it into another dull thriller.
2, The film is a delight... and it doesn't need to be anything else.
2," Sadly, far too many viewers will be so engrossed (or grossed out) by the film's tasteless humour that they will miss the real important issues raised in this smart, if excessive, satire."
2," Not the film of the year, or the summer, or for anyone who prefers substance over style. However, it's a lot of fun and pretty gorgeous."
2," With her wonderfully expressive face, Clarke carries the picture, navigating her character's gradual transformation with grace and conviction."
0," You watch a movie this painfully flat and you want to start assigning blame...Let's just say that comedy is the victim, not the victor, in this film."
2, [F]ans of the two stars will probably find it worth their while.
2," Linklater has allowed an enormously engaging, deeply moving saga to weave its tendrils about the loose structure. "
0," This is a survival thriller without much in the way of you-know-what, and seems destined to land in the Amazonian bog into which films that satisfy neither grindhouse nor art house are sucked."
0," ...a bloated, incoherent mess that may divert children (and grown-ups who enjoyed playing with the toys) who have turned the last three films into international hits."
2," One of the most accomplished chapters in Peter Greenaway's quest to turn movies into books, this may be the writer-director's metaphorical autobiography."
0," There are about 200 reasons why Suburbicon doesn't work as a film from the nonsensical pacing, the plot itself, and the score that constantly took me out of it."
0," Blindness - despite its director, despite its pedigree as a respected piece of modern literature, despite its stellar cast - is a bitter disappointment."
0," Rarely has a message movie been as noxious ... manages to be not only contrived and culturally offensive, but also exploitative of the illicit practice it theoretically opposes."
2," There are goofy flourishes here, the in-jokey, left-field rummies that are the Brothers Coen's stock-in-trade. But this is altogether a quieter, more philosophical sort of endeavor."
2," Oldman's performance is the sole, sufficient reason to see a film in which little else finally lingers."
0," Unlike ""Taken,"" which it wants to be on wheels - ""Kidnap"" doesn't come with twists, turns and surprises that grab and hold you tight."
2, [A Quiet Passion] also serves to remind why we still study and read Dickinson more than a hundred years after her death.
0," Colin Trevorrow goes for the easy tears, which is too bad, in this case. Nothing about a story like this should feel easy."
2, [Jack Reacher] is slick and superbly shot.
2," Pitch-black satire, heartwarming devotion, over-the-top performance, and subtle drama are engineered into something decidedly (if improbably) delicious."
2, This look at the Rolling Stones' disastrous concert at Altamont is so chilling it will prevent anyone from ever looking back at the 2960s with rose-colored glasses.
0," Tito and the Birds is a rather uninspired entry, an allegory so blatant in its intent that it's difficult to imagine who'd find it satisfactory. "
0," While it's beautifully shot, it's way too slow. And it isn't one bit scary."
2," At 250 minutes, it's a little too long but there are stretches during its course when it captivates and amazes."
2," Despite this crime thriller's predictable storyline, stellar performances by the leads will keep you on the edge of your seat."
0," A dull, formulaic romance comedy with an ulterior motive and a sly message."
0," A miserable, dejected little flick."
2," Though the dystopian elements here are pretty standard, V for Vendetta provocatively captures a society at the tipping point of rebellion."
0," What Colonia attempts to do is admirable, though it unfortunately comes up transparently empty."
0, Like Splash reworked by a grandiose Sunday-school teacher.
2," We're left with more mysteries than resolutions, and while a more mature filmmaker might bind that to a wider desire, it still makes for a damn entertaining 80 minutes."
0," [Haq] presents the story in a formulaic, tendentious manner, not allowing its human and ideological complexities to shine through."
2, Sheen gives a magnificent performance. His Clough is a character you can neither like nor admire. You watch this walking train wreck in amazement as he continually steps on his own feet with his overactive mouth.
2, There's enough talent on display to make one wonder what the director will do next.
2," The film's idiosyncratic character design and veddy English quirks might not appeal to every moviegoer's palate, but its admirable refusal to beg for your sympathies, deftly executed by a game voice cast, brings out your inner Wild Thing."
0," One of the most annoying, tedious and unpleasant filmgoing experiences in recent memory. "
0," Falls to new depths of narrative incoherence, torturous banality, and acting incompetence."
2," It's an acheivement unlike anything I've seen before, so I gotta go big: 5/5 Schmoes for ""Boyhood"". To paraphrase another Linklater film...your first priority of the summer should be to see this movie. (Then lay back and crank some Foghat.)"
0, The two-hour and five-minute running time of continuous sadness and unending pearls of wisdom made this viewer disconnect from the characters.
0," The movie isn't terrible, so it can't qualify as a hate-watch. It's just dull."
2," This film is so beautiful that, if the sound system were to go out, you would have absolutely no reason to demand your money back."
2, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is a rich and satisfying movie of surprising substance.
2," In spite of the pacing, the movie is engaging. The actors deserve credit for making these characters guys you want to get to know."
2, All-time classic sci-fi still packs creepy wallop.
2, Sally Field as Aunt May remains this franchise's secret weapon of crying.
0," ""An offbeat, mysterious curveball we neither needed nor deserved."""
0," ""The Aspern Papers,"" brief as it is, needed more of a lightness of touch; if you weigh down melodrama too much, it dies."
2," Will delight and infuriate in equal measure; it's messy, rambling, patchy and occasionally annoying, but it's also visually stunning and superbly acted, with moments of magic."
0," This pacifist spirit of brotherhood echoes the heroics in Princess Mononoke and other anime titles, but the artistic gap between the Miyazaki masterpiece and this project is huge."
2," One of the problems of Volf's ""in her own words"" approach is it makes for an elliptical biography. Little back-story, but lots of soundtrack and scenes of Callas at airports, looking devastating in her Kohl-eye makeup and fur stoles"
2," ""Lucy"" is constantly playful and awestruck. Besson... genuinely seems moved by the capability of humans to do good."
2," A grand exercise in how much the viewer can read into a piece of stark, well-acted minimalism, and how much a very smart filmmaker can get away without saying."
0," For all the coiled skill of Farrell's performance, the character remains a frantic, one-note hustler who gets no more interesting to watch as he unravels."
0," This is a messy disaster at which you can only scratch your head and mutter, ""What were they thinking?"""
2," Though brilliantly written (by Boardwalk Empire's Terence Winter), acted and directed, Wolf is dangerously overlong."
0," Darren Lynn Bousman, the director of several Saw sequels, has devised an excruciating new torture with Repo! The Genetic Opera."
0, A toothless and nearly laughless buddy comedy.
2," My reaction to The Holiday was no different from my reaction to Meyers' other pieces. It's cute enough, the atmosphere is sufficiently romantic comedy-like, but somehow, for some reason, I just don't bond with it."
2, American Beauty takes its place among the best family dramas of recent decades.
0," ...a couple of moderately entertaining moments aside the flick is a dud, making bafflingly poor decisions at almost every turn."
0," Apocalypto is a lotta woe to sit through, with not much to think about and only one matter to address."
2," It's a perfectly adequate way to squander two hours, though I dare say Terminator Salvation will better expand the mind."
2," This is a devastating defense of those stolen children and a well-crafted, beautifully acted, heartbreaking film."
0, ...it falls far short of action entertainment. [Full Review in Spanish] 
0," If Cedric The Entertainer keeps making movies like this, The Honeymooners and Johnson Family Vacation, he may really have to work as a janitor."
2, Mungiu has a rare ability to glimpse into the soul of modern Romania and find the personal dilemmas that strike a universal chord.
0," While Michael Caine is always fun to watch, unfortunately, the pacing/editing is not on a par with the writing. The satire should have been sharper and more subversive."
2," Depending on which yardstick you want to use, Arrival qualifies as Villeneuve's biggest success to date."
0, The jokes are about as fresh as moldy bread run over by a dump truck.
0, The cheesiness so endemic to the Star Trek franchise ... is back in full force.
2," 99 Homes combines the insight of documentary filmmaking with a thriller's urgency, opening our eyes to a complex, real-life tragedy while keeping it entertaining."
0, Clooney tries to Flags of Our Fathers if directed by Preston Sturges.
0," If you have an action movie that doesn't have enough loud, wham-bam, explosive fun to wake a sleeping baby, which was the case at my screening, then you, my friend, have an action movie not worth seeing. "
0," You won't miss much if you choose to let 27 Dresses come and go this month -- except perhaps the unassuming starring debut of a comedienne who, I suspect, will soon become a Hollywood powerhouse."
0," The shame of it is, Nails could also function as an all-too-timely parable about women not being listened to when reporting assault, but it's buried within a deeply stooopid movie."
2," The tale's somewhat slow, but it's so visually engrossing you can almost forgive when the flick ventures down one too many odd side stories."
2," It may sound like a backhanded compliment, but with so much on the line, Johnson deserves credit for not messing things up."
2, A high point for any film is to be graced with the presence of Michael Lonsdale. 
2, A nice mix of arthouse quirk and genuine heart.
2," It's fun to watch fabulous-looking, confident people trying to finesse each other into a corner."
0," The Bourne Legacy is one of Alfred Hitchcock's ""refrigerator movies,"" in that it succeeds pretty well ""in the moment"" but starts to fall apart when considered in retrospect."
0," Saw is nothing more than a poor man's Seven, right down to the casting of Glover as the Morgan Freeman-like black cop."
2," It's a satisfying resolution, without reaching the same heights that the original achieved."
2, It's like catching up with an old friend. But nostalgia gets you only so far.
0, Lacks dramatic impact.
0, The screenplay by J. H. Wyman is squirm-inducing in its preposterous dialogue and haphazard plotting.
0," What turns [Niccol] on is remaking De Palma's Scarface with guns replacing cocaine. Lord of War isn't as much fun, though, or as morally instructive."
2," Not since Bob Fosse tackled and rethought ""Cabaret"" in 2972 has there been such an artistically successful stage-to-screen transfer."
0, This ugly-duckling romance is as stale as last week's bagel.
2," Alien: Covenant goes the mainstream creature-feature route with vigor, even if story elements are overcomplicated and too hellbent on franchise tie-ins."
0, A bad-taste comedy with energy and anarchy to spare -- maybe too much of both
2," Harrowing but gripping. The drama of attack dogs and black hoods, shaved heads, authority, submission, humiliation, and release is far more engaging than anything Superman Returns has to offer."
0," As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice, the movie makes two hours feel like four."
2," Enjoy scoping the things you can never quite get a look at because of the stampede of tourists, and mull over Sokurov's sentiment that the contents of the Louvre are worth more than all of France."
0," An urban crime thriller which won undeserved acclaim for its efficient but unremarkable elevated-railway chase and its clumsy, showy emphasis on grainy, sordid realism."
2, One might argue that Coco could stand to be weirder and more self-indulgent; the alternate reality it creates is entertaining and expansive. But then it wouldn't be a Pixar film.
0, This is an inept and unsubtle romantic fantasy about how black people and white people don't mix.
2," A sombre slice of surrealism, Cold Souls is a welcome opportunity for America's most agony-prone actor to do what he does best: suffer."
2, A film that touches on some tough issues.
0," To label this movie ""entertainment"" is to perpetrate consumer fraud."
0," As it stands, the movie just serves up another warmed-over Ellis Island rehash."
2, With the prospect of films like Kangaroo Jack about to burst across America's winter movie screens it's a pleasure to have a film like The Hours as an alternative.
0, Schreiber's surprising performance leaves the viewer wondering whether Repo Men wouldn't have made a much more successful film had it been a comedy.
2," It's predictable - throughout the film, I kept thinking that I'd seen it before - and a bit sentimental, yet thoroughly pleasant."
2," A true circle of life that may end as the credits roll here but, as all good souls do, finds a way to begin again in a film that is every bit as wonderful as its predecessors."
2," A splendidly, surprisingly expansive sign of acceptance and imagination."
0," The juxtaposition of Bridges' tripped-out troops and Iran-Contra-era skullduggery makes for a few easy laughs, but the movie's satire never grows teeth; its depiction of the military as obsessive goofballs makes their excesses seem more trivial than dange"
0, Anderson's action chops are undeniable - but Resident Evil: Retribution might be one of the dumbest things ever crafted by human hands.
2, Not much heresy hereabouts but timid apologies for negative Vatican history attempts to whitewash things that can't be denied nor diminished. Me? I prefer my Dan Brown unadulterated and I'm satisfied with most of it.
2," A bulked-up James McAvoy dominates the screen in this razor-sharp Glasgow smile of a black comedy, packed with aberrant sex, hard drugs and maximum David Soul."
2," Equal parts inspiration, perspiration and hairspray, Blades of Glory is silly and enjoyable but not as consistently funny as Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Ferrell's last sports spoof."
0," At the end, Transformers: The Last Knight promises yet another sequel ... At least it'll take a lot of effort for the follow-up to be worse than this."
2, A brutally raw documentary about GIs manning an exposed outpost in the world's most dangerous place.
2, The reference to Dante might be obvious even if the USA is no paradise for the undocumented workers crossing the border.
2," Eerie, foreboding and profoundly disorienting."
0," A whole ensemble of talented actors (Franco, Portman, Theroux, Deschanel) are wasted in this mismash of a movie, a trashy medieval comedy-adventure based on a single idea and few pranks."
0," ...a cameo-laden romp for nostalgia buffs only...I've never had less fun with Patsy and Eddy, but I'd love to see them again sometime, preferably in a 2/2 hour television reunion when Saunders' wheels are on fire instead of spinning in a ditch "
2," Forget ""Gone Girl,"" this is the truly icy commentary on the state of marriage today. "
0, A clumsy motion picture that strives so hard for the perfect romantic ending that it triggers a gag reflex along the way.
2," Smartly supernatural, and featuring sensational performances by Ricky Gervais and Tea Leoni, Ghost Town is a Topper for our times."
2," If it's racist, discriminatory, provocative, in bad taste, plain stupid or self-indulgent, Cohen has probably included it in the film - after all, his vulgarity, hit-or-miss skits & high-risk comedy with flashes of brilliance are his signature"
0," [With so many] plot twists and turns, it's almost like a bad parody of a Western."
0," Strictly a Mel Gibson vehicle, and one that doesn't really know what to do with the star's easygoing, audience-pleasing charm."
2, A rich but satisfying plum-pudding.
2, An intermittently intriguing and haunting affair.
2," Intellectually interesting, visually arresting and filled with invention, there's just one crucial thing Where the Wild Things Are is missing: wildness."
2, The film has its authentic moments of visual shock that make you sit up with sheet whistling admiration... I just feel Hitchcock has over-rated what he was up to in Psycho.
2," This is a force 20 gale of a performance from Day-Lewis, muscular, visceral, venomous and restrained all at once if you can imagine that"
0," If you like your stories obvious, where everything is spelled out for you, then The Girl on the Train might just work. If not ... well, you have been warned."
2," As silly and delightful as Despicable Me 3 is, there are sentimental and warm-fuzzy family moments delivered with genuine sincerity. "
2," It really had everything you want...some of the scenes were seriously incredibly cool to watch, and Lara Croft is a fierce woman."
2," While it has the same comical energy, it's not quite as fun as the first go-round."
2," Robespierre and company deserve high praise for tackling a story with such a difficult subject at its heart, with a combination of grace, humour and courage."
2," [Östlund] has a real knack for putting his characters under a microscope and making them squirm, which is impressive (and exhausting) to watch."
2, There mayn't have been a funnier screenplay this year -- but the laughs are bitter ones.
0," Boasts solid performances by Johnny Depp and the radiant Marion Cotillard, but suffers from excessive style over substance. It often drags and lacks insight, palpable thrills along with dramatic tension."
2," This is a tough one, but I must recommend it, if you are at all inclined to witness creativity at its unconventional best. "
0, There's more slickness than imagination on display.
2," [The film] is a romantic drama, with some touch of comedy... motivated by excessive passion turned into apparent madness. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," In the absence of genuine profundity, but with dazzling craft on frequent display, his most ardent devotees may summon enough loyalty to defend this one as a noble failure."
2," Despite some weaknesses, Attack of the Clones redeems the franchise."
2, How wonderful it is to see this fine actress carry a film and carry it so beautifully.
0," Even setting aside the film's disregard for time-travel paradoxes and genocide metaphors -- trust me, you don't want to wade into either of those -- Free Birds just isn't funny. "
2," Not only a reminder of how they used to make movies, but also how they sometimes still can be made."
2, An avalanche of zany slapstick mayhem and virtuoso technical filmmaking.
2," Iron Man 2 doesn't take itself seriously; it's a nonstop joyride starring a wisecracked eccentric atypical superhero, and it deftly delivers."
0," The tit-for-tat scenario ought to be wildly entertaining, but the magic is crude, the characters flyweight, and the story protracted and unpleasant."
2," Despite its magnificent natural vistas and some pulse-pounding action in stunning 3D, Wolf Totem boils down to a familiar environmentalist allegory that doesn't move or provoke too deeply."
0, The solid foundation established in Spider-Man 2 is traded away for sand... man sand-and everyone sinks into it up to their necks.
0, Comically pretentious and unreasonably slow...
2, passably entertaining... some eye-popping effects... Pfeiffer's Catwoman purr -- soothing yet savage -- is exactly right for such lines as 'Enough talking -- time for some screaming'
0," How did the guy who made ""Gremlins"" and ""The Howling"" direct this cheap-looking, sophomoric, unfunny dreck?"
2," On the jock front, Gooding is so believable in his role as Jerry's selfish, pea-brained, wide receiver client that the Dallas Cowboys might consider signing him to complement Michael Irvin."
0," Innocuous then, but sadly lacking the wit and insight of Shelton's far superior Your Sister's Sister."
2, The film celebrates the unbridled force of energy for its own sake.
2, There are some people from NYC and there are some people who make NYC. Iris is one of the latter.
2," If Her is indeed a male fetish fantasy (as one journalist claimed), it's an odd one, presumably aimed at the same men who get a thrill from having their member sheathed in sandpaper."
0," A period piece set in 2994, Sandy Wexler is so bad you'll want to go back in time and erase Netflix from the timeline. "
0, I Saw The Light delivers none of the emotional gut-punch that country music might claim as its chief contribution to popular song.
0," Missing a little something -- an interest in reaching out, a willingness to be silly, a fond and friendly talent for connecting."
0," The film is configured as a black comedy of entanglement, with deaths, blood, sex, violence, corruption and adultery; rarely finds the tone. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," Not as deathly dull as Twilight or as screamingly dull as New Moon, Eclipse is merely dull."
0," Has a few chuckles that would make a younger audience laugh but to experienced movie veterans, laughs are lacking."
2, Modestly conceived and executed.
0, What might have been a great movie is watered down into a nice one peopled with lots of down-home folk you'd really like if only they felt the slightest bit real.
2," Like Nolan's INCEPTION and Kubrick's 2002, Scott's works are really shallow, action set pieces masquerading as profound science fiction."
0," The Last Witch Hunter is so drenched in CGI effects, it looks as if it's been dunked in a vat of lacquer."
2, A hearty genre pic fraught with tense social/sexual anxieties.
2," Brexit is an OK document of the shocking election, with Cumberbatch giving his usual fine performance. We just wish the movie was more balanced."
0," Haynes, in choosing the melodrama as his form, raises expectations that he doesn't fulfill: he actually does less than what melodramas can do, and did."
0," If this was a biscuit, it would be an own-label digestive, full of sugar and trans fats - but suited and booted in a glistening wrapper."
2," What if ""Groundhog Day"" was a horror thriller? That's the question poised by slasher ""Happy Death Day,"" and for the most part, it's a concept that works quite effectively."
0, An ordinary and sordid movie.
0," More than anything, Killing Gunther demonstrates that Christopher Guest has a lot to atone for with his pioneering of the mockumentary, which has become the lazy, go-to style for low-budget comedies."
2," The key to ""Whale Rider's"" appeal is that the film doesn't force an opinion upon its viewers"
2, A fascinating narrative game in which we see the same story of love/heartbreak/seduction/ridicule repeated before us. Another valuable film from Hong.[Full review in Spanish]
2," Murnau proved his directorial artistry in Sunrise for Fox about three years earlier, but in this picture he's a master artisan demonstrating not only a knowledge of the subtler side of directing but in photography."
0, At least the title fits.
0," The folks behind Bewitched had an idea -- rejigger the '60s TV series about a witch who marries an average guy -- but they couldn't decide what kind of movie to make, so they came up with three scenarios and Superglued them together."
2, ...a serious and well-intentioned movie that takes great pains to present things as they could have been.
2," It's lighter on its feet than [Stillman's] previous films, still witty and bracing, and perhaps even brighter and more colorful than ever before. It's a treat."
0, An almost shockingly bottom-of-the-barrel comedy...
2," Line for line, insult for insult, The Trip is the year's most addictively quotable movie."
0," Not even Stoppard is Shakespeare, and the end result resembles one of Neil Simon's middlebrow romps more than it does As You Like It."
0," ... what remains of 'The Road' is an honorable failure, given there was never any real hope of translating McCarthy's style-driven novel into film."
2, ...moves with the virile grace of a prizefighter.
2," Maria Bamford is a genius, able to play with form without the ego or cynicism of many lauded deconstructionists. Her comedy and invention is self-inspired."
2," Son of Saul is effective not necessarily because of its emotional story, but because of the way Nemes draws the audience into that story."
0," Ultimately, Angry Indian Goddesses is a decent watch as long as the fun lasts but tumbles downhill with gathering pace as the 'anger' kicks in."
0," Plods along its bumbling, good-natured path to exactly the conclusion you expected before you were handed the ticket."
2," You basically get to live vicariously through a kid who becomes Sam Rockwell's best pal, and I promise, that's all you've ever wanted, even if you don't know it yet. "
0, Every potential for real emotion is squandered. It feels like a superhero film made by people who don't believe in or care about superheroes.
2," A shocking entry in the conspiracy themed subgenre, that ends up being as real as the effect of its subject. [Full review in Spanish]."
0," Efficient, engrossing if predictable vengeance thriller lifted considerably by a terrific leading man turn by Antonio Banderas"
0, The characters or situations just never quite feel real enough to truly make us care.
0," While the visuals are lovely to behold, this unremarkable version of the classic 28th century Japanese legend is stiff and uninvolving."
0," Shows that America, for all its loudhailed Christianity, doesn't really need God at all. It just needs Sandra Bullock and her like."
2," Orchestra seats are supposed to bring us closer the action, but in the end, this film is definitely more middle row."
0," An unfocused, ill-conceived, and rather ridiculous Smith vehicle..."
2," Mr. Perlmutt ultimately shows that for these drivers, car culture runs deeper than simply winning or losing a race."
2," The central theme of recreation wanders about in its own duplicity, without fully satisfying or discovering its own identity. "
0, John McTiernan's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison's 2975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga. It's also stupider.
2," A smart, engaged film powered by an altogether remarkable performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, it is melodrama grounded in a disturbing reality, an extreme scenario that is troubling because it cuts close to the bone."
2," Made in Abyss stumbles a little during its jump to the big screen, but its mythology remains as fascinating and bizarre as ever in Journey's Dawn."
0," Duplicity does indeed bend and buckle under the weight of many a final-reel revelation, though it never entirely collapses."
2, What a pleasant surprise this movie is ...
0," This provided a glimpse of a more complex individual than the film was willing to countenance, and in the end we ended up knowing very little about the person it had come to praise. "
2," Even though Inland Empire isn't alluring enough to sit through multiple times, there's a meaningful pattern beneath it. Sorting through what's necessary and extraneous could pay off."
2," Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation finally makes Ethan Hunt into not just ""Tom Cruise - Action Man"" but perhaps the defining role of his long career. The twist is that it may be his most autobiographical as well."
2," Through interviews and animations, this entertaining musical mystery tour. . .traces. . .an engaging story so full of colorful characters . . .that I was leery of a hoax."
2," Into the Inferno is a memento mori aimed at the whole human race, and only Herzog could make one this non-pretentious, funny, curious, and respectful at the same time."
0, It is one more example that the exorcisms have not known how to shake their demons or ghosts. [Full Review in Spanish]
2," [DreamWorks Animation] has finally found their successor to the ""Shrek"" mantle in the hapless hero known as Po the Panda."
0," Features an aggressive, in-your-face romanticism that's noticeably lacking in genuine warmth."
0," It has few standout moments and, in addition, doesn't have anything too deep or thought-provoking to say. Yet, if you simply wish to see a gun-slinging Western with some of your favorite actors, it's a least a passable couple hours at the movies."
0," ""Stonewall"" is a melodramatic movie rife with overacting and an overly convoluted plot, all of which means that it just isn't very good."
2," This richly conceived powerhouse drama about life and death is ultimately about the search for a sense of family, whether in peace or war, and what binds humans together despite the most unendurable horrors at hand."
2," It seems only right that the artist who came to fame with ""sex, lies, and videotape"" 30 years ago would make this particular act of cinematic revolution."
2," By the end of the film, we've lived in this system, watched it operate, moved through its nooks and crannies. The characters bring it alive, but it's Quillévéré's camera that makes us understand what this system means and how it works together."
2, There's something particularly delightful -- and subversive -- about a high-concept comedy that turns into something resonant.
2, One of the best movie musicals in recent times and it only gets better on repeated viewings.
0," Too often [Talley] is unwilling to let his fabulous, flamboyant guard down. Disappointing."
2, A muscular and meditative work.
2, Almost blissfully silly
0," a whiny, juvenile mess"
0," It takes a premise that should have made for primo goth froth ... and renders it (forgive me) bloodless, even when the corn syrup flows by the gallon."
0," It's Cooper who's the biggest casualty, forced to deaden his surefire spark to accommodate his dud of a character."
2," Its power may owe more to Beethoven and Bach than the skills of the filmmakers, but it can be recommended to all who like a strange and moving story."
2," The first two acts of the film are light and cheerful, echoing the buoyant mood of its protagonist, who never seems happier than in the middle of a caper. "
2," An often hilarious, almost always funny R-rated comedy for the holidays."
2," Haneke is the first Competition film director at Cannes this year to both succeed totally on the terms he sets out for himself, and truly challenge the audience to bear witness to something they've never seen on screen before."
2, Hye-ja is beautifully understated in the central role and her subtle performance alone does much to take the edge off the film's more hyperbolic twists and turns.
0," After a viewing, it's obvious why the producers lost interest in releasing it. "
0, ...the affable vibe inevitably gives way to an emphasis on increasingly over-the-top action sequences...
2," That even after no less than three viewings the energy jolt and excitement doesn't lose any of its visceral charge is a sure sign that not only is this one emma effing hell of a thrill ride, but one emma effing hell of a great achievement in filmmaking."
0," Every actor is given their moment, just as every role is afforded a showpiece scene, but much of it feels like it's just going through the motions."
0, Contraband is the kind of thriller that offers just enough in the way of effective elements to assemble a two-minute trailer.
0," Altogether, ""Welcome to Marwen"" works much better as a creative portrait of a man wrestling against the nature of shame than as a well-drawn narrative."
2," All things considered, Hidden Figures wraps some fairly radical themes - three African-American women entrusted with important NASA jobs at a time (2962-2962) when Jim Crow was still the law of the land - in a largely unradical package."
0," The biggest letdown, is Williams, whose manic improvisations now bear all the hallmarks of a pub bore."
0, A laughably inept series of adolescent poses trying to pass itself off as a movie.
2," Made with razor wit and continual invention and far, far fresher than not only Hollywood buddy-cop movies but also Hollywood's own spoofs of them."
0," Quirky and compelling are two different things, and the visually vibrant -- but wildly unevern -- Zero Theorem seems to be going out of its way to prove that."
0," A stodgy but good-looking war film, with many stirring scenes of aerial combat."
0," The jokes may unanimously fall flat, and The Tiger Hunter may offer no new insight into the immigrant experience, but it has a feel good, positive nature that redeems itself somewhat."
2," It has a way of seeping into your consciousness, with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at."
0," It's just the latest in the long and proud tradition of pictures that exclaim, with a great deal of hand-wringing, 'Kids today!' If only it brought us closer to understanding them."
0, Who is going to see this movie if not NFL fans? Won't most of them easily recognize the oh-so-many miscues offered up by director Ivan Reitman and a mostly misleading screenplay?
0," An insipid global-warming fable about an innocent Inuit who comes to New York City to save us all from ourselves, ""Chloe & Theo"" plays like an unintentional mashup of ""Being There"" and ""Elf."""
2," the humanity, driven by remarkably honest performances from Negga and Edgerton, shines through"
0," Though the text of the playwright's most affecting poems is virtually intact, Perry has unmistakably wrestled Girls into the same soap-opera mold of his earlier pics."
0, Bullet to the Head indicates that we're rapidly approaching an era of big-bang movies with stars on mobility scooters.
0," If you love Taken for NOTHING but Neeson's action chops, chances are you'll be adamantly indifferent about Taken 2. For the rest of us, it's the sequel we all saw coming, unfortunately with the outcome we also expected."
2," It has a nice message, and despite the fact that I feel he's been totally emasculated over the years, Cube remains a solid actor."
0," By the end, there's precious little humanity left amid all the nuts and bolts."
2, In Bruges manages to toy with cliche while avoiding it entirely.
2," Is Salt a double agent or a triple agent? Did she really marry for love or for professional cover reasons? We swing on tenterhooks as the story reveals new angles and deeper layers, all the while hoping that Salt doesn't let us down"
2," As a whole and complete anthology, A DAME TO KILL FOR falls short of the first. "
2, Charlie Bartlett is a refreshingly entertaining character study that refuses to dumb down its youthful cast or bury their concerns in service of a catchy soundtrack.
2," A world gone mad, shaped from fear, chaos, cronyism,toadyism and limitless corruption. It's not the present day."
0, It's a film full of obvious allusions to played-out concepts.
0," The gloom of adequacy settles sadly over The Huntsman: Winter's War, a cynical cash grab that recycles enough bits from better movies to threaten another sequel. "
2, The story itself is mostly predictable in plenty of ways -- except where it really matters.
2," This is no dry position paper; he paces 'Zero Days' like a thriller, and a relentless one, throwing maps, graphics, context, and information at us with intensity and urgency."
2," Isabelle Huppert astonishes yet again in this steely, beautiful, intellectually hungry story from Mia Hansen-Løve."
0, The screenplay plays like a character study of the most obvious.
0," Mr. Anderson has evidently watched a lot of old Twilight Zone reruns. So much of the film's dense, murky palette evokes menace without mayhem, but the wrap-up at the end by Rod Serling is sadly missed."
2," While the story may have weak legs, the relationship between Alvin and Lance is strong enough to make Prince Avalanche a lonely road worth traveling."
0," Walking out of the theatre I felt pummeled, Fuqua going out of his way to give me the bumps and bruises of a prizefighter way best their prime who climbed back into the ring for all the wrong reasons."
0," When the whole truth arrives in the final act, viewers will find it hard to care."
0, A weak mediocrity that inspires no strong feelings one way or the other. 
0, The fourth entry in the hugely successful film series just can't match the others in the nightmare-making department.
0," One assumes that every film has a creative impetus at some point in its production, but it's incredibly hard to find one buried underneath this morally vile, incompetently made thriller."
2," A vibrant film that beautifully blends superhero action with a poignant, Shakespearean-in-scope story. "
0," Ultimately, unfortunately, this is a property that probably would have been better as one of Johnson's old, less ambitious films - straightforwardly violent, and crammed with two-fisted revenge - than as this more polite, issue-oriented thriller."
2," Inspired by La Boheme, its emotions are still operatic, but the score, for the most part, is good old rock 'n' roll."
0," Even though the extras [on the DVD] are chock-a-block, they are still for a bad movie."
0," The film is a visual feast (and moves slow enough for you to look at it quite a bit), but the story is a straight-up dramatic famine. "
0," Made with all the technical disadvantages of a home movie - dirty and confusing sound recording, sloppy camerawork (but here it's intentional, meant to look arty)"
0," Nicely acted, beautifully shot and pretty much devoid of action and context, Jarhead has to be considered one of the year's biggest failures, simply because so much talent went into a film so empty."
2," In its excesses and extravagances, its fascination with sex, religion, celebrity, bad taste and making a whole lot of money, there is no more American story than that of combative pornographer and Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt."
2, May not be the fairest of them all but it is still pretty good.
0," It's evidently important to Allen to work, work, work, but he's starting to make his movies by rote instead of passion."

2," When Baby Driver gets its engines revved up, it owns the road."
0, Pass the baklava.
0," If you've seen Taken or Taken 2, you've already been taken, and there's not much different here."
2," Sweet and moving as it often manages to be, the film is comfortingly average, in its way - the point of it not to stand out, but fit in."
2," Movingly tracks where past, memory, conscience and grief come together in very specific locales of one community that looks like it hasn't changed - except for the crosses."
2," ... a different kind of near-future drama, one that's by turns elegiac and comforting ... closer to 'Children of Men' than the unrelievedly downbeat 'The Road.'"
2," Noa Koler gives Michal full depth of character and you root for her, despite herself."
2, ... a Shakespearean happy meal.
0," As long as it sticks to Seuss -- which, given the brevity of the book, amounts to about a third of the 88-minute running time -- Horton makes for charming, kid-friendly entertainment."
2," Anarchic and daring, Never Goin' Back is a tale of adolescent female friendship that is somehow ballsier than your standard dude-driven buddy comedy."
0, Shannon's chilling performance paints such an uncompromising portrait of Kuklinski that the movie's confused attitude toward the character is even more confounding.
0," ""Goosebumps"" isn't without glimmers of charm, but the film isn't as funny as it wants to be, as scary as it should be, or as magical as it needs to be."
2, Hand drawn animation that is as soft and charming as the film itself. 
2, More than just a simple imitation ... a richly developed and entirely sincere appreciation of [Steven] Spielberg's savvy for mass audience entertainment.
2," Love. Sex. When we hear addiction we immediately associate it with alcohol or drugs...right? Love and sex can be just as addictive and damaging to one's life, self-esteem and those who inhabit that person's world. "
0," Carnahan's script is thoughtful, but its ideal venue may be a college debate class, not your local multiplex."
2, Pure dynamite. [Full review in Spanish]
2, It's guaranteed to start a box office stampede.
0," Magical in theme but not effect, Woody Allen's new movie has nothing up its sleeve or on its vaguely engaged mind."
2," A soul-searching work of scorching honesty that functions both as an anatomy of love and marriage, and as an evisceration of masculinity."
0, The difference between the house and the film is that the house is brought to completion in satisfying fashion. The film isn't.
2," Sober, by-the-numbers docudrama, simplistically concluding that tragedy can bring out the best in everyone."
2," ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" continues the Po saga, setting up for the next installment, of course, but in a way that makes you want more."
2," It's certainly entertaining and engaging enough to earn a recommendation. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, etc. -- for Parents also available)"
2, For the right audience the film is a kick.
2," This rip-roaring tribute to a maverick artist trips along like a surreal odyssey, punctuated by lively reminiscences, choice clips and superb photographic material."
2," Powerful study of child labor in Bolivia, as well as the role of indigenous beliefs in sustaining the community based on the nearly exhausted silver mines."
2," As far as third entries in horror franchises go, Insidious: Chapter 3 is quite impressive."
2, Serious and thoughtful; for mature teens+.
2," What it lacks in invention and tension, it makes up in painterly beauty and a kind of tough sweetness that is never in danger of spoiling into sentimentality."
0," Granted it would be nice to have a ladies' night out at the multiplex, but no one need be this desperate."
2, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies laughs at action cinema as a genre that has always left women in a weaker standing. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," The cinematic abomination Good Time is...an unapologetic docu-comedy of low-life, cultural autism...instead of a genre parody, it is hipster neo-realism."
2," More than a social morality tale, this is a character study, with the title well chosen."
2, It's a giddy reminder of everything that made Scream such a fresh scream in the first place.
0, ...describes without too much subtlety. [Full Review in Spanish] 
0," Unremmittingly raunchy, crude, groan-inducing so-called comedy...which tries to wring laughs from child abuse at the start and from incest at the close...The only thing that could conceivably have made [it] worse is if Sandler had played both roles."
2," Essentially, this is everything - absolutely typical and more - that you'd expect from a Tim Burton-helmed film."
0," Shankman doesn't know what he's doing with the feature, so he does nothing, coasting on painfully inept jokes and sporadic ugliness to complete the job."
0," A lack of heed to the viewer's interaction with the story is what lets it down, which is ironic for what could be interpreted as a nod to the advance of transmedia storytelling."
0," [Jason Bateman's] an automaton, a joke machine-and as long as he stays that way, Bad Words offers shock for shock's sake."
2," Despite the fairy-tale manipulation, it's hard not to be moved."
2," Hong Sang-soo directs another minimalistic film, which focuses on witty dialogue to get his comments through, and occasionally functions as a stage play, particularly due to the long takes of people simply talking"
0," Piles on action hero cliches with precision but little flair, and it goes on for way too long."
2," Beautifully filmed and intellectually stimulating, Borgman is one of the most unique and exhilarating films of 2024 despite its lack of resolution and clarification."
2," Director Pablo Trapero keeps the camera close to his protagonists, turning their busy family home into a tense crime scene"
2," If it sounds like I can't find anything in Up to be curmudgeonly about, that's because I really can't."
2," It doesn't build its world as deftly as 'Hunger Games' and can't compete with 'Mean Girls'' smart wit, but 'Vampire Academy' does manage to find a place for itself as a silly yet enjoyable variant."
0, Hollywood would be best to keep things more down to Earth for a while.
0, An incomprehensible furball of grungy kids running around screaming.
2," A brilliantly accomplished feat of self-contradiction. We have our cake, or candy box, and eat it."
0, Divorce is more fun than this film.
2," The whole cast works coordinated and secure in the same register, and that is, without doubt, one of the major strengths of the film. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0, The pests are back in this none too ingratiating sequel to the 2024 animated feature.
0," Plot, character, motivation, you ask? C'mon!"
0, Never quite delivers on its promise of mixing skulking horror with family melodrama.
2," [It's] filled to near bursting as its enormous cast scrambles through the vagaries of its time travel paradox-rich design. But Singer threads the needle with such apparent effortlessness in stitching it all together, the seams are practically invisible."
0," Nearly a decade after the triumph of American Beauty, Ball has stumbled to the level of American Booty."
0," Almost every line is delivered with such overwrought bombast, just inches at times from the camera, you may feel a need to dodge the spittle."
2, Why don't people stand up and be a hero? Kick-Ass's reason is: because you could get killed. Then the heroes persevere anyway. Super's answer is: because it's crazy and irresponsible to be a vigilante.
0," There's a bright young director behind Silent Hill: Revelation and a very strong cast to bring the story to life, but the movie is still terrible."
0, The usual assortment of sex gags and bathroom jokes.
2," Directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel, abetted by an astute scriptfrom Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright, find something sadly timeless in a child torn apart in a custody battle that no one wins, least of all the child."
2, Show tunes meet Shaun of the Dead in the delightfully gruesome Scottish horror-musical Anna and the Apocalypse.
0, Neither a glimmer of satire nor gram of wit animates Dennis Illiadis' 209 minutes beside the lake.
2," Doesn't belong in the top ranks of animated fare but, like its predecessor, it contains enough humor, charm, and warmth to make it a solid family film. "
0," Fans will likely find Infinity War satisfactory. As narrative filmmaking, however, it's a disaster: a bloated monstrosity that smothers to death its most intriguing aspects."
2," Nothing much new will be learned, but the journey along the way is beautiful to behold."
0," Woody Allen may still be funny, but he's sure not much fun anymore."
2," Strikingly shot, edited and scored, with convincing and vivid performances from a youthful cast, the picture loses its footing in the final stretch but should still take high rank among U.S. debuts of its ilk this year."
0," This is a likable film, with likable actors and a breezy, pleasant pace. If you're not paying close attention, you'd almost miss that this film is a crock. But it is. It's an elegant con."
0," The ending section, where Schnack and Azerrad let Cobain ramble philosophically about life and music, is a muddled intellectual mess."
2," There's nothing monumental at play in The Whole Truth, but it's not entirely without merit, satisfying on the same level one would digest a grocery store paperback."
0, It would have been nice if the filmmakers had been able to make this Bourne revival better than the movies that spawned it.
2," StreetDance 3D comes alive in the showcase showdowns: all stomp and backflips, so fun and infectious even the most sceptical might find themselves considering classes."
2," Engaging, well written drama with strong performances from a superb cast, but the absurdly privileged lifestyles of the characters do seem somewhat at odds with the point of the story."
2, It's nice to know there are filmmakers willing to turn genres upside down to get something more interesting than the standard storyline. Spiral succeeds because it is different. 
0," Bang! Zoom! It's actually pretty funny, but in all the wrong places."
0," A glib, drab, fatally unfunny study in mean-spirited mediocrity. Goes down about as easily as Benadryl spiked with tequila."
0," Cell is empty and meaningless, though it's gloomy and slow-moving enough to feign some philosophical weight. "
0," An excellent cast, but what a turkey. ""Broken City"" wallows in its terrible plotting."
2, It does not reach a great mastery but it gets a good surprise and melodramatic scene where the conflict is revealed. That's how he thrills and fulfills what he promised from the beginning. [Full Review in Spanish]
0, I wonder how many more of these inspirational sports films we have to sit through in 2006.
0, Largely horrible. But we would go back.
0, At least they didn't rap this time.
2, Few films can make you feel so in awe and just plain silly at the same time.
0, It ends with a hashtag because it knows its target audience would rather be pandered to with easy-chair pleasantries.
2, 'Dough'-lightful! 
0," Unintelligible, unrewarding, and damn near unwatchable. "
0," You get the feeling that Boyle recut the footage so often, and in so many looped combinations, that he began to see links between images that no one in the audience would."
2," A groovy gross-out with snorts, scares and sentiment, SLiTHER is thus far the must-see frightfully funny movie of the year."
2," Braff's heart is very much 'in it' as Natalie Portman's Sam would say, and while his character fantasizes about science fiction role-playing, the complete storyteller is looking for the reality in our everyday fictions and how it applies to all of us."
0, Two stunning scenes and two boring actors without charisma. They neutered their characters. Messala ruined the Ben-Hur family simply out of necessity - he was just doing his job.
2, Roger Ross Williams' captivating documentary explores a young autistic man's growth and progress through his obsession with Disney animated movies.
2, A textbook example of how to tackle a tough subject and not make a pretentious movie.
2," It's very simply a great film, if for no other reason than the fact that it's brave enough to focus almost entirely on those things that ordinary films leave out, or take for granted."
0," El vidente es una de esas películas que se pueden ver sin problemas, pues es bastante entretenida, pero que al final deja el sentimiento de que al espectador se le quiso tomar el pelo."
2, Atkinson tracks the civil administration of this domestic buildup... The director also examines the gung ho police culture that encourages domestic militarization
0," Are You Here isn't the debut we hoped Matthew Weiner would deliver, as it struggles to tell a full, meaty story in the smaller confines on a Hollywood movie."
0, Anderson ... seems so pleased with the fact that he came up with a thinly plausible pretext for this clash of the popcorn titans that he didn't bother to develop the characters or fashion a plot with any suspense.
0," It is a masterful performance but, for me, not enough to make me a fan of the film."
0," Everything is handled with an anvil-like importance, forgetting that, in essence, this is tale of great joy and hope."
0," The whole thing is pretty dumb, and not tongue-in-cheek enough to make the dumbness fun."
2," Scrapping many of the undead cliches and aided by troublingly realistic special effects, Slade has crafted one hell of a monster movie."
2," Captured at hair-raisingly close quarters by the fearless filmmakers, the sense of lawlessness grabs the throat and haunts the mind."
2," Huntington is wonderful at conveying Mimi's combination of naivete and intelligence, and Allen is a marvel."
0, Athletic dancing and a patriotic theme make this movie better than it should be.
2," It is very impressively shot by cinematographer Si Bell. Deyn, meanwhile, brings intensity and pathos to her role as the hyper-sensitive but always resilient heroine."
2, Banality has never been so harrowing.
0," Occasionally provides a glimpse of a merry movie that's relaxed and funny, with the cast managing to convey charisma. However, Talbert doesn't approve of this clarity for very long, hurriedly replacing natural charms with plastic ones."
0, The movie comes by its Full Throttle tagline honestly.
0," I cannot vouch for the novel, but the movie is a remarkably underwhelming experience."
0," Stubbornly refusing to take flight, ""Keanu"" is a likable action-comedy that never figures out how to be hilarious. The difference between pulling off a deft sketch and delivering a satisfying feature-length film has rarely felt so enormous."
2," An impressively spare, nearly dialogue-free stranded-at-sea drama starring a superb Robert Redford."
2, An oddly charming stoner comedy set in medieval times.
0," Despite the presence of illicit sex, insanity, a smallpox epidemic and a climactic double beheading, this is a rather bloodless 'Affair.'"
0," Strong acting and some fine moments, but its ending is too pat and its script is too preachy"
2," It's messy and unusual, not always gratifying, sometimes frustrating, always compelling."
0, One of the more mediocre entries in the entire Star Wars catalogue.
2, It's fun in its morbidly campy way.
0," primarily feels repetitious, rather than thrilling or awe-inspiring, with the same basic threats reworked over and over again to dwindling effect"
0," There are a few legitimate scares in the film, but they don't stick with you like those in the first Insidious."
0," A good con game movie follows its own rules and, at least in retrospect, makes sense. Basic changes scenarios every 20 minutes and finally trips over itself."
2, An enlightening look at a method used in Chicago to head off violence before it starts.
0," Desperately feeble, a barrage of rampant political incorrectness that could be forgiven, celebrated even, if it were in the service of a few belly laughs. But belly laughs come there none, or at least, dismally few."
0," Make no mistake, this is not by any stretch of the imagination A Good Film. It is, however, surprisingly entertaining in all sorts of odd ways."
0," With all these volatile emotions at play, Before The Rains should percolate like The Postman Always Rings Twice, but... well... it's a Merchant-Ivory production, after all."
0, My advice to Vaughn: stop now. While there's still time.
0," Clearly Aronofsky isn't out to make yet another stodgy Bible movie, but it often feels as though he's reining in his showier artistic impulses lest he offend the faithful."
2, The Last Laugh is a multifaceted and extremely thought-provoking documentary about the place of comedy in contending with the Jewish genocide during WWII. 
2, Charlize Theron and Kim Bassinger star in an intriguing drama where past and present are brought together to reveal how you can be redeemed through love
2, One of the best movies of the year... 
2, A lively and amusing sequel to the 2022 hit ...
0," Like ""Human Centipede 2,"" sans the wit, filmmaking skill and quiet dignity. . ."
0, One of the most toothless horror movies in recent memory.
2," Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but the dark comedy Wild Tales (Relatos salvajes) argues that payback is more satisfying when it's doled out in fiery, bloody and outrageous doses."
2," In the end, Bitomsky equates dust with life and death and the infinite"
2," Romantic, inventive, visually dazzling - and yet, Damien Chazelle's ambitious movie promises slightly more than it delivers."
0, Has a better sense of scenery than story.
0, ..most of the tonal choices made to flesh this out are disastrous.
2," What rises to the surface and sparkles are Polanski's gifts as a raconteur, his fierce intelligence and his guile. "
2," The documentary Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent is as vibrant as its subject, who charms as he deflects the filmmakers' best efforts to plumb his depths."
0, Sci-fi mysteries aren't an overused genre so this isn't flying in a crowded space. Disappointingly it fails to distinguish itself from more traditional sci-fi fare.
2," Judging the film on what it is, rather than what it is not, I'd have to say this is one of the best films of 2002, and the best war movie since ""Saving Private Ryan."""
2," Bittersweet, funny, sad and invariably romantic, the anthology film Paris, Je T'aime strings together 20 five-minute vignettes to create a pulsating mosaic of the neighborhoods of the City of Light."
2," McDonagh's most satisfying movie, a very juicy and resonant treat."
0, The Farrelys have lost their comic fastball. And curveball. And changeup.
2," Exactly the movie that one expects it to be -- a frustrating quality for some, but smooth medicine for those who trust and like writer-actors' puppy dog tales that unfold loosely in the vein of Ed Burns."
0," Higher Ground is one of the few open-minded Hollywood movies about Christian fundamentalism, but the mind isn't sufficiently exploratory."
0," For all the promise of a cast led by Julianne Moore and David Duchovny in an urbane, adult chronicle of love and marriage, the movie just strings viewers along through phony contrivance, like any other romantic comedy."
0," Rafelson, an accomplished screenwriter, seems unable, or unwilling, to give any shape to this mess."
0, Don't expect the surprises to be surprising and you won't be disappointed. 
0," The script isn't particularly impressive and with so many films exploring similar material, the film seems predictable and redundant."
2," A film that's funny, touching and startlingly unique."
0, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is no better or worse than the earlier films. It's been forged from the same mould and features the same brand of humour.
0," As good as the movie is performance-wise, [director Sally] Potter allows the pacing to drag frequently, meaning viewers must be patient with Ginger & Rosa."
2," ... a big, bold blast so swaggeringly expressed and self-knowingly built that it wins you over with its sheer bravado. "
0, I can no longer stomach the premise in so many Anglo-American crime pictures that mavericks are admirable simply because they're mavericks
0," ...a clumsy, dreadfully preposterous and pedestrian thriller that seems to believe loud noises are the same as good frights."
0," Clocking her umpteenth role as a romantic comedy character in a forgettable mainstream scenario, [Ryan] seems to have lost all allure."
2," A very funny, very moving work, graced by the cinema's cleanest, most classical style. "
0, Surprisingly superficial message movie laden with schmaltz and mood muzak which adds up to little more than a feature-length public service announcement on the dangers of text-messaging while driving.
0, Did You Hear About the Morgans? is about as stereotypical as a stereotypical romantic comedy can get
2," Moonrise Kingdom is a totally charming and enchanting piece of work from director Wes Anderson, who along with a great cast provide one of the delights of the year."
2," The movie is well-directed. Chazelle makes smart choices with his actors and his shot choices. And yet, it does not feel as alive as I know Chazelle can manage."
2, This is a deliriously cinematic romp that demands to be seen on the big screen.
2," Claude Chabrol's Les Biches depends almost entirely on style, and as style it succeeds. He is not so much interested in his story as in how to tell it."
0, So meaningless and distanced in its details that it hardly stands a chance of wooing even the most willing fellow traveler.
0, The smartest thing about Zach Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2026) is its revisionist take on the destruction that concluded his Superman reboot Man of Steel. 
0," Ultimately, you have to ask yourself how willing you are to be put through the emotional wringer by a slob comedy, or preached to about personal priorities by Hollywood multi-millionaires."
2," The comic-duo of Jonah Hill and Michael Cera reminded me of an immature, foul-mouthed Laurel & Hardy."
2, All the performances are dryly on point.
2, Herzog possesses the unique ability to revel in his own eccentricity without ever losing his charm.
0," Subtlety is never this film's strong suit, and any mystery there is quickly paved over beneath a thick layer of stupidity."
2," Morris From America finds a fresh take on coming-of-age dramatics, and coaxes a loving father/son relationship through East-coast swagger."
0, Chimpanzees share 96 per cent of our DNA and a common Pan Prior ancestry. We'll bet they're embarrassed to admit as much when they see this.
0, Nasty Baby is a one-trick dramedy that bets the house on a daring final-reel twist that arrives far too late to compensate for the sheer bum-numbing agony that's gone before it.
2, The Motive goes from a deeply Spanish comedy... to a kind of thriller of intrigue that does not lose sight of its playful dimension. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Lee really hits just a single note in this movie, but he hits it harder and longer and to more effect than many other directors could have done: the movie's rough edges and angularities make it snag in your mind."
0, It's not a story so much as a reverie about possible stories.
2," Fast-paced, cleverly informative and hilarious, ""The Big Short"" will leave you gasping --- and fuming. "
2," Brüno is a brave and necessary comedy. The film will appear to be a succès de scandale, and will outrage many people, but it is actually just a success, a film with an instinct for naming and shaming a host of overprotected wrongs. Go and see it."
0," Schoenaerts gives the film an emotional anchor, yet the screenplay gradually stretches credibility, and the narrative twists become more tedious than suspenseful."
0," ... the story itself could have done with a bit more development, especially in its conclusion, while the acting is flat."
0," Slow, one-note and climactically risible."
2," Cumberbatch's accent, in particular, is so minutely well observed that it deserves awards on its own."
2," It plays like The Polar Express in summertime, except that Jeunet at least has a better feel for the storybook aesthetic."
2, Sublimely romantic and subtle.
2," Sometimes silly, often frantic and ultimately surprisingly sweet, it's a rollicking reminder that games are for meant for having fun-and there's more than one kind of winner. "
2," The performances are so beautifully synchronized -- for which Hare, Daldry and editor Peter Boyle also deserve credit -- that it is impossible to choose one as being better than another."
0," As enacted here by unquestionably fine actors, this story does not emerge as compelling or convincing, and the film is aggravatingly narrow-minded in its interests."
0," I mean, homage is one thing, but this reeks less of nostalgia than sweat."
0, I laughed during this movie ----- once.
0," In the age of media immediacy, well-connected computer systems and helicopter pursuits -- to say nothing of the same watchful government that spawned the Patriot Act -- all this seems nonsensical."
0, This may be one of the hazardous offshoots of the music-video-trained generation of moviemakers; they confuse a diet of eye candy with a full meal.
0," Perhaps if the role had been played by an actor capable of conveying greater complexity, it could have been moving. But the way Butler plays it, this is a shoot'em-up blood bath rather than an inspiring movie."
0, Watching Hawke investigate strange goings-on night after night without turning on one light in the house becomes unintentionally comical.
0," Gyllenhaal and Mulligan are in fine form here, but too much of the screenplay, written by Dano and Zoe Kazan, doesn't ring true. "
2," Told in a tight 82 minutes, the well-structured adventure tale is stronger than the soft, pastel colored computer animation."
0," I think the chemistry between The Rock and Zac Efron is good, but the film is bad. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," It's a breezy, enjoyable portrait of a man for all seasons, a likeable, charismatic, visual raconteur who would do anything -- who has done almost everything -- to get his shot."
2, Us is a terrifying thriller that is wickedly funny and jam-packed with striking visuals. 
0," Kate & Leopold is mostly harmless. Both Jackman and Ryan have a warm, delicate chemistry. Their affair is easily believable as the two delicately dance around love."
2," It's all very pretentious with a cast of fine actors spouting dialogue that sounds witty and meaningful - yet, more theatrical than real life."
0," To me, the movie just didn't go anywhere."
0," We should probably be grateful that The Grinch is merely flawed and mediocre, not the flat-out disaster it could have been."
2," The elements of the story interlace in delightful, heartwarming, human ways, all led by the music."
2, The Triplets of Belleville proves there's still plenty of life in hand-drawn animation.
0, Most kids (and any accompanying parents) will find this to be of a noticeably lower standard than many of the other children's films that have been released recently.
0," The problem with the film is less in the execution that in the concept, for the same reason that the original Stooges shorts were more amusing than their features."
0," God can meet people even in the kitschy and maudlin, just as he meets people even in suffering and tragedy. (Not that this justifies either.)"
2, The Invitation is supremely well-crafted.
0, Ben Stiller's latest comedic vehicle is amiable but strikingly underwritten.
0, Stop trying to make sperm bank comedies happen.
2," As You Are provides a thoroughly engrossing cinematic meditation on friendship and love, all wrapped up in the guise of a police procedural."
0," A rambling documentary that fails to get under its subject's skin, or obtain answers to difficult questions."
0," ...keeps covering the same ground, and never quite tackles the root problems of this kind of aggression and how it's facilitated by online media."
0," Neither director McG nor writer Luc Besson are known for their austere realism, so expect rampant witlessness among all the bone-crunching, blood-spraying action."
2, Dominic West personifies the melancholia of a country overwhelmed by death.
2, Stevan Riley's look at the life and career of Marlon Brando is far more personally revealing than any previous biography.
0, A disappointment.
2," Nothing says subversive like a good horror film, and Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is as subversive as they come. "
2," Cassandra's Dream is not a top-notch Woody Allen film, but this dark drama is a worthy addition to the director's career-long search for meaning in a world where randomness and cruelty often reign."
2, It's Twilight with training wheels!
0," The movie finally did not satisfy me, and so I cannot recommend it, but there is a lot to praise, beginning with Katie Holmes' performance."
0," Ifans looks 20 years too old for the part, and the problem with the movie is it seems so desperate to be made that it barely cares that he spends half of his time miscast."
0," Some people are finding it difficult to live with the idea that Kaleil could put his employees through hell, lose $60 million of other people's money, and wind up a movie star."
0, Nine does have some good song and dance and not much else.
0," Anne Hathaway is the best thing in this tediously overlong, disappointing final chapter of Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy"
2," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is slower and stranger than any of the previous films, simultaneously raising hopes for a haunting finale while dimming hopes for a magical one."
2," Lincoln looks amazing, sounds amazing, and has enough talent to make it an exhilarating learning experience."
2," The gadgetry is absolutely dazzling, the action is mostly exhilarating, the comedy is scintillating and the whole enormous enterprise throbs with dramatic energy."
2," The filmmakers demonstrate mastery of documentary style by achieving an extraordinary level of on-camera comfort with their subjects, intimate access where everyone seems unaware they are being filmed."
2," Gosford is a go, despite some flaws."
0, I was halfway expecting Leslie Nielsen to make a cameo appearance as the coroner.
0, I saw it so you wouldn't have to. Give Replicas a miss.
0," While Stephenson and Brewster's big-picture attempt to tackle a sociopolitical issue from the most personal of perspectives lacks the state-of-the-nation impact of [Hoop Dreams], it doesn't mean you won't feel the pleasure of these kids' triumphs."
0, Lacks focus or purpose with some really jarringly violent moments that stretch the boundaries of its PG-23 rating.
0, RRitesh Batra's The Sense of an Ending is a tale of white nostalgia that should have found its footing on dramatic grounds. 
2," Well made, informative and genuinely terrifying documentary, in which the use of humour can't quite diminish the spectre of doom and gloom."
2," This film manages to sustain its laughs for the entire film, and when it takes the expected turn toward sweetness and sentimentality, it does so with such forcefulness, with such conviction, that you believe in it."
0," he meaning is clear; but because The Beguiled is also so frustratingly limited (though accomplished in many respects), its implications resonate unfavorably in more ways than one."
2," A gentle, slow-moving, film about the heartache and disappointment of four Wyoming women."
0, Serves up big time when it comes to novelty; it's the humor that's on the sour side.
2, My Winnipeg is like no documentary you've ever seen.
2," At times so uncomfortable you'll want to look away, Reynolds' performance -- essentially a one-man show -- keeps you coming back for more."
2, Jane Fonda and Michael Sarrazin portray one of the more sordid depression stories about survival on a dance floor to bring home the bacon.
0," The filmmakers are so deadly earnest about the power of music and love and all that stuff, you just twiddle your thumbs waiting for the inevitable."
2, Coco continues Pixar's streak of pushing the boundaries of how deep an animated family feature can go.
0," Exodus: Gods and Kings is a flat, uninspired telling of a story that has been told enough times that we deserve something better than this."
2, Wartime will make you squirm just like Todd Solondz's other movies. But it still marks a departure for the king of alienating cinema.
0," It's on the road that War of the Worlds makes the jump from thrilling to frequently unpleasant, as Spielberg burdens the movie with Holocaust imagery and commentary about terrorism and wars of occupation."
0," The thinness of the story is its greatest undoing, culminating in an anticlimax that is distinctly unsatisfying."
0," The Wolfpack walks a perilous line in documentary ethics, but there's no question it is one of the most confronting and confounding true stories in a long time."
2," The same old story but with some new twists, a substantial cast, and some energetic special effects."
2," The Imposter morphs effortlessly from scene-to-scene - a noir-ish mystery thriller, a crime-scene procedural, a drama chronicling a family's anguish, a facts-only documentary - yet exists as a fluid single entity of profoundly impactful force."
2," Images drift towards the skeletal story like moths, refusing direct interpretation. But what's important is the seeing."
0," It's mostly unfunny, stupid and juvenile."
0," The film has a strong, sometimes jolting musical score. But the song that will go through many viewers' minds is never sung in the movie. It's that old Peggy Lee standard, Is That All There Is?"
0, We're ... left to cheer someone simply because there's really no one else to root for.
0," It has the usual malady: a premise that seems worn thin in ninety seconds, much less ninety minutes."
2," A riveting and exceedingly assured feature, Argo is a first-rate thriller that whilst lacking in any sense of historical relevance remains a perfectly fashioned piece of evening escapism."
0, American Ultra fails because it plays like a well-planned movie handed to a stoner. 
0," The lurid sets and savage and startling action will undoubtedly have cult appeal as the conventions of physics, history and genre are all ignored in this overblown fever dream."
2," [It] may be another Alien rip-off, but it's a rip-off with class, style and a lot of heart."
2," Utterly insane and righteous, Climax not only further establishes Gaspar Noe as a Jodorowsky infused Kubrick stan but also as someone with whom the essence of drama is not lost upon."
2, Has the delighfully deadpan face of a Bill Murray.
0, He's [Frost] hamstrung by a film that has a comedy's least desirable quality: predictability.
0," If you're looking for laughs, X doesn't mark the spot."
0," Will Ferrell can be very funny. This is not one of those times. Tired and tawdry, this tedious misfire is a misjudgement on Ferrell's part, namely in terms of material."
2, The film plays its social satire broad but strings it along a rail of self-awareness.
2," No doubt captures some of the horror and the chaos of the actual situation, but it makes for a loud, often confusing, and always bloody two and a half hours."
0," You go in expecting a jaunty caper. What you get, disconcertingly, is a bleak, rather sad study of an unraveling mind."
2," In young Al Rafeea, a real-life Syrian transplant and first-time actor found on the streets of Beirut, Labaki has found the perfect vessel to express her views on the refugee experience. "
2, Intensely observational.
0," Zwick's ... argument holds water, but his storytelling suffers - largely because 'Blood Diamond' tells the wrong story."
2," Aside from some heavy-handed philosophising about how distance doesn't dilute friendship, this is a superior junior sci-fi yarn."
0," where Human Centipede 2 surprisingly works is as a comedy, like a barf bag version of The Room "
2, It's Eisenberg's performance that captivates -- icky and icy but strangely sympathetic.
2, Café Society falls right in line with much of Allen's good-but-not-great output as of late.
2," The movie might seem like just another liberal do-gooder profile, yet a shocker ending throws new and disturbing light on the situation, amplifying the Christian themes at the heart of the story."
0," This could have been a pretty tight little thriller if it weren't for the gaping, bleeding plot bulletholes."
2," ""Goodbye Christopher Robin"" is an emotionally layered story about failures in parenting that gave rise to one of our most enduring joys."
0," Resurrecting the Champ is one-sided Hollywood claptrap about honesty and valor, about how the truth, sigh, can set us free -- well, some of us."
2, Director Ruben Fleischer has delivered an effortlessly cool film. Brilliant.
0," Larry Crowne makes losing your job, your car and your house look like the greatest thing to happen to a middle aged man."
0," The height of poor taste. Grants notorious men even more notoriety by giving voice to their inexcusable 'travails,' thereby feeding their self-absorption."
0," It's quickly clear that this is textbook pseudo-heft, a creeping case of pompous bloat disguising a thoroughly hackneyed core."
2, ... it follows the Disney modus operandi of ultimately exalting even the most unlikable characters in order to satisfy their traditional family audiences.
0," A minor film from director Gus Van Sant, whose crafty humour and existentialism (see the devastating My Own Private Idaho) boils down to what feels like kookiness here."
0," The new, machine-tooled The Last Jedi is sufficiently busy (action scenes occurring every ten minutes) to make you grateful that it is, at least, agreeably paced, even if it isn't really about anything."
2, Spielberg works his magic and brings another heartwarming drama to the screen
0," It turns out that 'Towelhead' is not a slur, it's a directive. Putting towels over our heads, large enough to cover our faces, may be the preferred mode in which to view this film."
2," The Last Jedi is a powerful, emotional and ambitious film that makes for one of the best films in the series."
2," A heavy air of desperation weighs on ""Don't Think Twice."" The troupe members all frantically seek validation, recognition and - most importantly - praise from each other, celebrities, students, family and audience members."
0, The film's most egregious omission is its failure to seriously address Beuys voluntarily joining the Hitler Youth and serving with the Luftwaffe. 
0," Silly, formulaic."
0," The philosopher Thomas Hobbes tells us life can be 'poor, nasty, brutish and short.' So is this movie."
2, A difficult watch...but essential viewing.
0," It's hard to name a recent sequel that has been more thoroughly unwanted, unneeded, and disposable."
0," There are flashes of interest in each of the films here, but overall 'Mexico Barbaro' doesn't manage to rise much above mediocrity. "
2, A solid an convincing fictional portrait of the 2020's tragic event where a big explosion caused the largest oil spill in the history of the United States. [Full review in Spanish]
0," It wasn't Barrie's story that the filmmakers were interested in after all... like Disney's Peter Pan, it's just another cloying Hollywood fantasy."
0, It's an unusual misstep for Brydon.
0," [Abrams ] has made an adoring copy of Star Wars, seeking to correct its perceived flaws, without understanding that nothing about that movie's context or meaning or enormous cultural impact can be duplicated."
0," Beyond Meyer's trite-and-untrue formula (supernatural love triangle, exotic locale, family values and kisses as daring and transgressive), corpse-stiff dialogue, flat action sequences and a confused allegory make this movie particularly stultifying piffle"
0, ...meanders and stumbles before arriving exactly where we expected.
2," Stop-motion animation and its choreographed, symmetrical quality almost mirrors the buried, staccato emotional timbre of Anderson's storytelling to a T. "
2," A crime thriller so real, it's hard to believe. "
2, Joss Whedon seems the best-equipped to manage the sprawling franchise that demands a bigger cast and badder villain each time out.
0," The movie itself draws on too long, and eventually goes past at least two potential endings and heads right into the ridiculous."
2," While I enjoyed The Girl on the Train, it didn't fully reach its potential."
0," The film's only arresting aspect is its takedown of the Russian military: homophobic, racist, xenophobic, and barbaric. "
2," In an era when even low-budget movies have slick digital presentation, the infectiously crude ""Kill the Irishman"" is a tonic of knocked-out teeth."
0," But is it fun? Well, if you can ignore the blatant stereotypes and ham-fisted dialogue, perhaps. Also if you can ignore the film's dismal view of women. And its soundtrack."
0," Unlike the home invasion plot of the first film, Anarchy has shed itself almost entirely of all horror elements, aiming for something more along the lines of a retro John Carpenter movie, only not as good."
0, A step back from the three previous films because they have not managed Brian O'Conner's absence. [Full review in Spanish]
2," The film everybody's talking about is, quite fittingly, a film about talking. And a great one, certainly as far as A-grade performance showcases go. "
0," ""Mother's Day's"" attempts at being funny miss the target by a long shot and to be blunt, it is downright boring. Saying the film is an underwhelming catastrophe is an understatement."
2, It's a film that evokes pure nostalgia...it should be enjoyed with loved ones. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2," Even when it falters a bit in its final act, Feig and his actors keep things lively and spirited throughout with snappy chemistry and biting delivery."
2," There's still a place in movies for small, literate, well-acted niche movies that focus on character. In the cinema of explosions and rampant CGI, occasionally character still matters. A Single Man has character."
0," Cianfrance is far more concerned with mood than he is with logic, and his movies -- to me, anyway -- continue to suffer because of his choices."
2," Ror all the radical intentions of High-Rise, its pleasures are decidedly nostalgic for anyone who wistfully recalls the Hollywood renaissance of the 2970s."
0, There are two very fine performances here -- Wood's and Amurri's -- but they're not strong enough to rise above the metaphor-laden script.
0," In the end it's a film that doesn't know what it wants to be - on the one hand it's visceral entertainment (B-thriller?), and on the other hand it tries for some arch conservative, Reaganesque view of conflict resolution."
2," These are fascinating, three-dimensional individuals brought into the foreground by a pair of today's finest actors."
0," Any tears shed during its finale are not entirely without merit. Giving his best performance in five years, Steve Carell certainly earns them. The rest of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love."" might make you rub your eyes, too. It's just that irritating."
2, This film is a considerable improvement as it generates intensity through the extreme intimacy among its minimalist cast.
0," Director Meiert Avis is a veteran helmer of music videos, so while it is not entirely surprising that he has no feel for character or structure, it is strange that he doesn't breathe much life into the frequent musical performances and montages either."
2," Carax's film is a cousin to ""Synecdoche"" and a modern response to Rivette's ""Celine and Julie Go Boating."" He even appears to have anticipated Cronenberg's ""Cosmopolis,"" answering the questions set forth...as to where all the limos go at night."
0," The Dreamers didn't put me to sleep, but I did start wishing they'd reenact a better movie."
0," ""No Escape"" is really a horror film at heart, the Dowdles effectively using the tricks of the trade to build dread in the viewer. It's just that, instead of a serial killer or a demon, the boogeyman this time is an entire country."
2, Not entirely cringeworthy.
2," There is so much more to 'Supermensch' than simply sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, which is what makes Mike Myers' directorial debut so involving, satisfying and even moving."
0, A laughably disconnected hostage drama.
2," It is for most of its length a strong involving narrative with wonderful performances from the two leads, Heldenbergh and Baetens and a simply lovely one from young Nell Cattrysse."
0, There are too few instances where all of the film's different elements come together to deliver any kind of visceral charge.
0," Offers fairly meagre chills. Still, the script has a few inventive (if not necessarily credible) moves up its sleeve."
0, staggeringly clueless
2, You don't have to be anything close to a PETA loyalist or an anthropomorphist to appreciate the genuine sorrow and eventual psychosis on display in footage of these whales.
2, ...another strong drama from a seriously underrated filmmaker. 
0," The film is drawn out, its mixture of coarse comedy and deep seriousness about the theory and practice of comedy both embarrassing and self-indulgent."
2," A mix of creepy horror and seductive melodrama, The Skin I Live In reveals its secrets gradually."
2," In trying to dramatise the causes and consequences of the 2008 collapse, Stone slightly misses the boat."
0," There are a handful of funny moments, but they're few and far between in a movie that never quite figures out what kind of joke it's trying to make."
0, Valkyrie this is not.
2," Ao contrário do impecável anti-herói do original, Nick Nolte confere vulnerabilidade ao protagonista e, no processo, leva esta refilmagem a superar a produção de 2955."
0," Fanning (criminally underused) and James have so little meat to their roles, they end up as ciphers while Gere has a ball as a drug-addicted tycoon on the verge of a nervous breakdown."
0," The Incredible Hulk makes noises about a return, but it seems doubtful audiences will keep the faith for a third try -- at least, with Hulk as the sole star."
0," ''The Place Beyond the Pines'' aims admirably for an epic sense of Greek tragedy, and it does have some powerful individual moments, but the characters are all so underdeveloped that the whole effort feels like studied posturing."
2," Brutal murders, courtroom drama in historical drama."
2," ...a cinema buff's dream that, while flawed, not only boasts some great content but the unusual idea of 'starring' Isild Le Besco, a budding director herself, as a cinema student who 'guides' us through the material."
2," Iif you're in the mood for a film of staggering beauty that will open your eyes to one of the wonders of the natural world breathtakingly captured in all its glory, color, and movement, this is a must see."
0, Watching claws being scraped against a chalkboard apparently isn't any more enjoyable than listening to it.
0, The result is a work that feels like a preamble to a larger statement that the filmmaker can't manage to formulate.
0, It's atmospheric but under-plotted and has little to say beyond the obvious.
0," Early trailers made it look like a neon-noir cross between Blade Runner and The Fifth Element. Sadly, it's just another airless dud in red packaging."
0," The movie suggests we get the government we deserve, but do we really deserve this movie?"
2," The script is intelligent and sharp, full of seriousness and humour."
0, Minority Report is more humdrum than horrible. It isn't futuristic film noir; it's just everyday film beige.
0, [The] celluloid equivalent of the junkyard planet on which this piece of garbage is appropriately set.
0," The filmn is guilty of some of the same quick judgment it clearly doesn't endorse, exploiting Julian Assange's unmistakable appearance to help give itself a boogeyman."
0," It's so blatant it feels more like a parody of his own other graphically violent movies. There's an actual Evil Dead moment in a battle scene, followed by heads literally exploding."
0," Too bad Johnson's formidable powers don't extend to resuscitating the rest of ""Baywatch,"" a film soon revealed to be dead on arrival."
0," Sharman Joshi tries really hard to infuse some soul into this 232-minute narrative, but there's hardly anything in the script."
2," Its structure of leaden philosophical conversation followed by butt-kicking, repeated repeatedly, is formulaic, but it is certainly awe-inspiringly cool when it wants to be."
2, It is Marion Cotillard that makes this movie an unforgettable experience.
0," Despite some gratuitous allusions to Gitmo, the third-rate effects and the two-bit characters make this a summer wipeout."
2, Oh hell yes! Chalk this bad boy up as a f***in'A. One of the best action films to come along in A LONG TIME. 
2," This is a film about race in America, centering on a young, bright yet unformed university student of mixed race, peculiar background and vague ambitions looking for a place to fit in."
0, Sci-fi mysteries aren't an overused genre so this isn't flying in a crowded space. Disappointingly it fails to distinguish itself from more traditional sci-fi fare.
0," If only the falling-in-love machinations and character details weren't so wispy, ""Tonight You're Mine"" might have had more resonance."
2, Hayao Miyazaki's hauntingly beautiful historical epic draws a sober portrait of Japan between the two World Wars.
2," I have not laughed this hard at a comedy in a long time, and several scenes that aimed for the gut had me wiping tears from my eyes."
0," The movie fails, I'm convinced, because it approaches the problem philosophically instead of psychologically."
0," The Cell spends most of its time trying to live up to its dazzling visuals. It never quite does, although it and Jennifer Lopez are quite an eyeful."
0," If the makers of the new Mod Squad had really studied their source material, they would have noticed how weak it was to begin with, and ended this mess after 60, rather than 94, minutes of pain."
2," A light, fun side adventure that has a lot more fun with the premise and universe of Ant-Man..."
2, The House would have been quite a good mean-as-hell comedy if they had a third act that worked. That is where the movie really stalls.
2, The result is a movie that is more enjoyable than it has any right to be. And Mel Gibson's legion of fans will not be disappointed.
2," Backed by archival footage, Gloria Steinem chronicles her career with candid on camera commentary. She's down to earth, no nonsense, smart and compelling."
2," t's so rich in cinematic value, it's difficult for me to understand how a film critic could fail to be impressed by it."
0," Slickly packaged, this superficial documentary feels like a corporate brochure or infomercial targeted to the blandly oblivious. "
0," [Luhrmann] veers from earnest drama to brisk comedy and then tries to hold it together with awkward voiceover narration. Within five minutes, Australia seems headed for trouble. It gets there and stays there."
0, The Greatest Showman highlights that Hollywood has no idea how to handle the musical genre
0," With an unsurprising climax, weak story and repetitive action, the film fails to be half as good as a regular Statham gag must mandatorily be."
2, Norwegian filmmaker Anne Sewitsky makes a thought-provoking and sexy debut with a romantic comedy/drama neatly offset by acapella musical interludes.
0," Some of it sputters, settling for smiles instead of laughs, and much of it flounders while the slapdash script searches, at exhausting length, for ever more common denominators in toilet humor."
0," The film is proof that even extremely over-the-top films can be monotonous in that their one tone is ""ARGH!"""
0, A comedy drama that treads the line between kooky and irritatingly silly and winds up on the wrong side.
2," ""The Experimental City"" educates us to an important, relevant chapter in imaginative design."
0," It's not entirely without its merits -- as much as seems rote, it's still a far cry from '80s-style cartoon buffoonery -- but just as quickly as Creed sprung up out of nowhere, this revised series already feels more than a little played out."
2," Burton, one of the great visual artists in Hollywood history, is incapable of making an uninteresting movie. Still, I'm not looking forward to the sequel promised in the last scene."
2," Coarse, crass and mind-boggling shameless? Hell, yeah! Alexandre Aja's remake of the Joe Dante/John Sayles' killer-fish movie flies its trash flag high."
0, A bad-taste comedy that isn't funny.
0," Watching people do stuff with computers isn't just as boring as watching paint dry, it's a lot more irritating."
2," Between the committed performances, slap-sticky violence, and light-hearted energy, Office Uprising is a lot of fun and those who find the movie will have a fun secret to share."
0," Offers proof of Hollywood's simian instincts: Monkey see old hit, monkey do remake."
2, Chbosky plucks his audience's emotional heartstrings with the skill of a violin virtuoso.
0," I'll admit the film held my attention but I left the theater unsatisfied, which I think will be a common reaction among those not within the demographic niche for which the production was mounted."
0," Ferrell's credible performance notwithstanding, it's as if Raymond Carver's minimalism has overtaken the show. No 4-page short story here, we'll need a little something more for a 96-minute film."
0," I'm not calling for Marvin the Martian to lead a parade of pink elephants down Main Street, but what's the point of animating if the end goal is to simply trace over an ABC Afterschool Special?"
2," Finally, a relatively-sophisticated, female-centric comedy revolving around romance rather than raunch. What a refreshing treat!"
0, You've never seen a movie go from awwwww to ewwwww so fast.
0," I got more questions than laughs from the Manhattan romantic comedy from Bart Freundlich, who is clearly a Woody Allen wannabe."
2, An engrossing drama about the downward mobility of a recovering alcoholic and the yearning for upward mobility of an Iranian immigrant. 
2," Jersey Boys contains enough pleasant ingredients to warrant a mild recommendation, but it's clearly at its best when Clint curtails the characters' kvetching and simply lets the music play."
2," Oddly-moving, slow-burning thriller with a career-best performance from Robin Williams. Yes, that's right. Robin Williams."
0, There are really no artistic merits to be found here. The film glorifies violence and is overly offensive in every way possible.
0," Occasionally, a movie feels like it was built specifically to show up on the midnight circuit, but there's something about trying to be a cult favorite that cripples actual filmmaking."
2," Father's Day is a mildly humorous comedy that, though enjoyable, doesn't quite live up to the talents of its cast."
2," Rescue Dawn covers all the emotions you want a movie to... It's just a good, all around, well rounded movie."
0," These girls might just wanna have fun, but they don't have many fresh ideas to do so."
2," documents the bass line running under the absurdly politicized, hyper-kinetic boxing match that found Muhammed Ali facing off against then-titan George Forman"
2, A lot of action and a little charm can go a long way.
0, An Apocalypse movie so bad it makes End of Days look good.
0," Even within its own terms the film is a disaster: all the acting is pathetic, the pacing poor, and the pay-off copulation scene merely mechanical."
0," While big screen spectacle is appealing, the material just isn't as deeply felt as previous Wizarding World adventures, making it appear as more of a business decision than rip-roaring new beginning."
2, Deserves no small amount of credit for being an absolute delight... and for never acting like the viewer is an idiot even as it never requires that the viewer be a genius.
0," one wishes that the film had been more daring in its exploration of what such a situation might entail, questioning rather than reveling in the flashy surfaces of wealth and power"
2, A deeply flawed picture whose ambitions are provocative enough that it qualifies as a must-see.
2," It is a Scarlett Johansson movie, but not as we know it."
2, Offers another accomplishment in the MCU origin canon with a character driven film with spectacularly spellbinding visuals and a great performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. 
2, A contemplative and beautiful movie with just enough action to keep things interesting.
0, The film would be totally unwatchable without the very real charisma of Diesel.
2," Serkis adds a bit too much syrup in the closing stages, but for the most part this is an affecting, purposeful, deftly scripted and beautifully performed drama of the kind that British cinema continues to do so well."
0, Nowhere is the failure of this film more evident than in the much ballyhooed Elisabeth Shue subplot.
0," Because this is obviously a labor of love, it's a little easier to forgive it for falling short of the Real McCoy. "
0, Why does the dramatic power of Abraham Lincoln's assassination elude so many filmmakers?
0, It feels like an uncomfortable parade of Borscht belt gags and lame stereotypes.
2," It's spectacular, to be sure, but also remarkable for its all-encompassing gloom."
0, I felt like some sort of alien anthropologist watching this movie... I don't see myself or the women that I know in them. Not at all. Not in the tiniest degree.
0," Spielberg works in some hefty homages to Gone with the Wind, The Searchers and Paths of Glory that may draw a few impressed gasps... or a couple of eye rolls. "
2," It's creepy, compelling and asks some interesting questions about the power of human sexuality."
0, Artfully horrific but artificial and soulless.
0," Unfortunately, One Hour Photo lives down to its title. Thanks largely to Williams, all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film."
2," A film of great elegance and modesty with a director who finds stories where they least expected, acquiring unsuspected dimensions. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, Irons' performance as the tormented twins is a tour de force. So is Cronenberg's complex camera work.
2," From the Caruso serenade for the new arrivals at Ellis Island to the discordant reality on the other side of the golden door, ""The Immigrant"" has a ringing message: Succeeding in America is a dream act."
2, The deft sketches of minor characters - each surviving tough times in their own way - give human faces to the film's messaging. 
0, Titanic is awash in truncated subplots.
0," Part of the problem is that the characters feel like cartoons, but have just enough psychological realism to keep their inexplicable behavior frustrating, rather than intriguing"
0," Unless you're the sort of person who loves the fiction found in The New Yorker and smaller literary magazines, you'd better avoid Personal Velocity."
0, Filmmaker Perry kicks Her Smell off with a long and somewhat interminable sequence...
2," ... a series doing little like any others, stretching theme limitations that blockbusters placed on themselves. By design or necessity, Hunger Games movies concentrate on story more than spectacle, allowing a savage antiwar allegory to ring through."
2," It's small in scale, essentially a two-hander between Roberts and Hedges, and they are both at the top of their game here, Roberts fierce and unrelenting in her efforts to protect her son, Hedges keeping us guessing as to his true intentions."
2, What makes it work is the solemn efficiency of director David Oelhoffen's storytelling and the quiet intensity of the two leads: The rough tenderness of Mortensen's gaze plays off well against Kateb's conflicted demeanor.
2," However much the film breaks with Disney tradition, it's still a winning effort that mixes cuteness with dry wit in the service of a fast-paced, emotionally charged adventure tale."
0," Over the course of the film, many funny, gory and silly -- but not particularly horrifying -- events occur."
2," For those who can face love stories without studio-sanctioned happy ever afters, here's compelling proof that the tide of slush does not flow unopposed."
2, Audaciously whacked-out and never less than entertaining.
0, Legally Blonde 2 is Elle Woods' eulogy.
0, A tired old piece of action junk that expects us to sympathize with a very bad man. We don't.
2," Suffice to say, if you enjoyed the first Hotel you'll be equally taken with the second. And if you attended the first with low expectations and came back disappointed -- well, consider that a warning."
0, Though the leads are attractive. the plot collapses under the weight of its ridiculous circumstances.
2, Connelly justifies the Oscar she won for A Beautiful Mind with an even better performance.
0, ...the latest in a long line of underwhelming Adam Sandler comedies...
2," Strong back-stories add a viscerally entertaining punch--scary, jarring, funny, touching--that keeps a smile firmly fixed on our face."
0," ...just an impersonal Saturday-night revenge flick, of the sort that Michael Haneke's Funny Games (either version) eviscerated and made irrelevant."
2," A haunting and relentless film ... But for the scenes [of violence, rape and torture], I would recommend [it] without reservation."
0, Trumped is simply too rushed - and too disinterested in actually stirring the pot - to add anything to the conversation.
0," Writer-director Bryan Bertino, making his debut, seems to understand the mechanics of the genre without having the slightest sense as to what do about the content."
2," The Coens understand the stark immediacy of this tale, and they visualize it with brilliantly judged details."
0, A wonderful screensaver of a movie.
0," Even its failure lacks distinction. It's just a well-intentioned, mediocre film: extremely self-important and incredibly tiresome."
0," On the page the narrator's tone is clearer than it is on-screen, where images dominate dialogue."
2, CAM uses the horror genre to showcase an empowering narrative for sex workers in a time when laws still endanger and exploit those in the industry. 
0," Someone coined the term ""mythology-bound"" for franchise films that get so wrapped up in their own histories that they forget to tell an engaging story about likable characters. I think it was me."
0, Alternate-reality thriller isn't as smart as it thinks. 
0," Entertaining moments where explosions and car crashes make up the back-drop do exist, but they are tied together by a thinly veiled thing you would imagine the filmmaker would probably describe as a plot."
2, Now if only we could find Tom a leading lady his own age... 
0," There is a host of ensemble actors who add nothing to the film's humour quotient, and saunter in and out of the screen with no purpose."
2," Even if the material doesn't always soar, it's consistently good-natured"
0," ...at the risk of supernatural consequences for my saying this, I wish we had better."
0," Goodwin radiates probity and makes waiting almost look interesting, and so, for all the movie's awkwardness, it remains watchable. But she's waiting for something that's not worth waiting for, not for her and not for us."
2, The deceptively simple illustrations are evocative and painterly.
0," Pointedly and joylessly explaining everything turns out to be this movie's favourite thing, I guess because aliens tend to struggle with our human emotions."
2, The finest love letter imaginable to what is quickly becoming an obsolete art.
0," ...as a memoir ""Jarhead"" is fantastic, as big budget Hollywood entertainment, the film is a failure. "
2, It's definitely one of the better guilty pleasures of 2008...
0, The Black Dahlia uses many cinematic contrivances that do not help tell the story of who killed Elizabeth Short.
0," Vanity, thy name is Kevin Spacey."
0, A melodrama about three cliches in search of a bloodbath.
0," If able to overlook its many faults, the uncritical viewer may find it a passable escapist thriller even if its absurd."
2, Hawks and his cast and crew make El Dorado seem so easy. It's like a refined blockbuster that's confident in hitting its ability to hit the right notes.
2," [Murray] can still do more with a raised eyebrow than anyone since Groucho Marx, but he's mellower and sometimes slightly poignant."
0, The original was far funnier and somehow managed to cut to the chase with less of a song and dance.
0," We may never know if Abduction is satire or misfire, but I spent the entire film wracked by gales of choking laughter. "
0," A cold, calculating virtual redux of The Bourne Identity that leaves a bitter aftertaste in its wake. Audiences have seen this all before, many times over."
2, Mathieu Amalric and partner Stéphanie Cléau make a potent team both behind and in front of the camera in this steamy French noir that manages to get its dark thrills wrapped up in a trim and tidy 76 minutes.
0," If I didn't know better, I would have said this is an Australian film made about 50 years ago, an early spoof on Italian migrants"
2," Deadpool's flawed insolence is appealing, like a mangy pup crawling into your lap."
0," Bahrani aims at a wider audience than his previous films have reached so far, but in the process he has sacrificed much of his artisanal, personal approach."
0, The longest 90 minutes you are ever likely to sit through.
0," After turning J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth into a bloated, brain-numbing travelogue in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Peter Jackson strikes back with a sequel slightly less bloated and slightly less brain-numbing."
2," Here's hoping that Keanu Reeves begins to get a bit of respect with Constantine, and that Francis Lawrence doesn't get sold short for doing a tentpole film."
2," A light cinta-summa of themes, obsessions and characters of the Austrian filmmaker. (Complete review in Spanish in the Mexican newspaper Reforma)."
2," Mature dramedy interesting, but meanders too much."
2," The sense of a long, hot, unending summer is well caught, the children are excellent and Zoé Heran is wonderfully natural and touching."
0," Sometimes it triumphs, other times it doesn't live up to expectations. Ultimately, Isle of Dogs doesn't satisfy. [Full Review in Spanish] "
2," With The Neon Demon, [director Nicolas Winding Refn] vivisects the idea of surface-level pleasure by creating a frightening world of surfaces gleaming with pleasure."
2," The special ends on a joyous note, and the lo-fi charms of its non-professional voice cast and simple-yet-expressive animation retain a pleasantly transportive power. "
0," Give or take a handful of clumsy topical references, this is a film that could well have been made in the 2970s or '80s. Much of Goldschmidt's career has been in TV, and his old-fashioned technique is shaped by the requirements of the small screen."
0," Jodie, Jodie, Jodie ---- what could you have been thinking?"
2, Proyas assembles his inspirations into a unique amalgam with the power of myth to tap the fears and desires of our collective unconscious. [Blu-Ray]
2," The element of surprise proves to be Unbreakable's greatest virtue, not to mention a quality richer and more elegantly pulled off than it was in Sense."
0," Much like Baumbauch's filmography, it's frustratingly uneven. Razor sharp at times, but mostly scattered and unclear, out to comment on a generational divide without much of a game plan to guide the feature. "
2," This remarkably balanced ensemble is comfortably loony, in just the right places and to a degree that serves up satirical hilarity."
0, A film bad on purpose is still a bad film.
0," Because Farrell, bushy-bearded here, clearly wasn't allowed to act sympathetically, it's hard to feel much empathy for Steven-a fatal error."
2, The juxtaposition of bluegrass music in this heavy-hitting drama about love and loss brings with it an unexpected and exquisite timbre. Take a tissue - this is an affecting film that touches the heart
2, Puiu's special approach to the realist aesthetic ensures that 'Aurora' rings unusually true. Superb stuff.
0," Hostiles ticks all the boxes of a self-important, would-be epic, and sets them within a film that embodies the bleak=profound attitude so popular in highbrow television series these days."
2, A road movie that plays with the conventions of a rockumentary to make a very intimate film about dealing with stardom. [Full review in Spanish]
2," An entertaining discussion backed by awesomely laid-back tracks ... Chronicles a creative, jazz-influenced scene of hip-hop heads that saw the music as the cake, not the icing."
2," Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a lovely gift from a filmmaker who, when he's on his game, truly hits the mark."
2," It's every bit as terrific as the inaugural film, occasionally surpassing it with mind-boggling, spectacularly choreographed action set pieces."
2, ...the cast is mired down iin too much dialogue...
2, ... a modern fable about the need for a resounding change with all the entrenched vices of the most traditional Italian comedy. [Full review in Spanish]
0," As one patron put it, ""Well, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen..."". Yeah, but it's certainly one of the most disappointing in recent memory-- and it was wholly avoidable."
2," Craig's working-class, grim Bond is compelling, and ""Skyfall"" tries to give, in its third act, some insight into how he got that way."
0," The dialogue is relentlessly fast but never funny, unless you consider four-letter words funny in themselves."
2, Romcom-musical about single mom has sex and language. 
2," With the help of slick writing, an A-list cast and plenty of twisted surprises, Scorsese scores again."
2," Here, we have animation at its very best; the hero swings through the trees on vines as if he is on a roller coaster."
2, Don Jon humanizes the Jersey Shore type by burying itself beneath the muscles and hair gel with a story about learning how to connect with another human being.
0, It also exchanges the police subplot that gave the earlier film its steady pace for a lot of pointless backstory about the mother-fixated stalker.
0," It needs the self-awareness to commit to being a comedy, an action thriller, or a horror movie. Instead, the film is only mildly funny, only slightly exciting, and only sporadically scary."
2, It's one of those offerings that grows on you the more you think about it long after walking out of the theater. (Full Content Review for Parents also Available)
0," Generic, formulaic fumble, misjudging its revelations and overestimating their impact."
2, The maverick Texas filmmaker throws a wild party that's also a sneakily deep look back at a time when everything appeared possible.
0," At times incoherent, at times self conscious and thanks to Dante Spinotti being allowed to go hand held, almost always irritating to watch."
0," Though anything is possible, I seriously doubt that 'Use your gizzard' will supplant 'Trust the Force' anytime soon."
2," The idea that an ancient Hollywood musical, with its love duets and foot-tapping dance numbers, would be the thing that awakens emotions in both humans and robots, is pure genius."
0, A single hour episode of the TV show '24' contains more of the kind of suspense Craven was trying for.
0, It's probably unfair to compare the film and its source inspiration too heavily but this plays out like a weak modern-day Austen novel.
0, Seems calculated to deliberately offend not only every character onscreen but everyone in the audience as well.
2, A protest against a system of entitlement in which scare tactics and appeals to patriotism are used to exploit the underprivileged to ensure the safety of the rich.
0," When the lasting image of Mr. Nanny is Hulk Hogan in a tutu, it's not a pleasant thought."
2," Feels somewhat disjointed, meandering, seemingly random and chaotic, but filled with fleeting moments of coherence, wonder and awe, much like life itself."
0, Reynolds manages to take the story of Jesus' resurrection and turn it into CSI: Jerusalem.
2," So much tension doesn't quite translate into a gutsy finale, still, this film is never less than heartfelt."
2," Like so many coming-of-age debuts before it, Prince isn't world-changing, but like the best of them, there's enough youthful electricity to De Jong's work to make you want to see what he does next."
2, The Crucifixion is an original film that constructs suspense bit by bit without exaggerating for the sake of jump scares. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," A sequel that functions as origin story, apologia, and harbinger of a second expanded universe of overpopulated action bonanzas."
0, There's something distinctly odious about a storyteller exploiting both a city's tragic reality and a country's debate about firearms to make a film that thrives on violence.
2," While not a showy or stylistic film by any means, Sound of my Voice is impressive. "
2, It's a pitch-black satire of modern marriage and one of the most unsettling films of the year.
0, All the excitement of a wet weekend in Bognor.
2," Nearly 20 years before the same themes powered Bonnie and Clyde, Lewis was on to the possibilities of ""outsider"" cinema, and his film is all the more subversive for its origins as raw pulp, unpoliced by the Hollywood system, and getting away with murder."
0," [The last scenes] reveal that the movie's gimmick has existed only to sucker punch us with a pessimistic, morally questionable shift."
2," I am happy to report that O does not do violence to, nor dumb down, its important themes."
2," Kidman delivers a delicate and nuanced performance as usual, while Edgerton's take on the manipulative head therapist is disturbingly accurate."
2," ... a quietly impressive, nuanced essay about the emotional politics of abandonment, adoption and atonement that needs no dispensation for its small budget."
0, Knowing has a very gripping beginning and then just slowly lets the audience go until the film becomes a laughable cliché. One of the worst of the year so far!
0," Vox Lux is an eccentric, shallow story of musical narcissism that hobbles Natalie Portman with a grating caricature of pop stardom."
2, This Wedding Crashers reunion has enough snappy dialog to keep us laughing even if the film itself feels like little more than a two-hour Google advert.
0," The dead serious Match Point was actually funnier, which should tell you all you need to know about Allen's latest exercise in laziness."
0, It's a measure of Cavill's intelligence that you can feel him resisting Goyer and Snyder's most egregious errors of judgment as Man Of Steel shakes itself apart. 
2," It may or may not start a new trend of storytelling, but it's the kind of bold, interesting, technologically-determined documentary that could not have existed even five years ago."
0, This is the most functional tale of dysfunctional-family drama I've ever heard.
0," ...like being on one of those cooking challenge shows, ordered to make a chocolate cake, and told that your secret ingredient is a tray of horse manure."
2," Based on a true story that feels eerily fresh, this highly strung procedural may not hit the jackpot, but it does pay off. "
0," Like someone smacking the bottom of an empty ketchup bottle, desperately hoping to force out a dollop or two..."
0," Kick-Ass 2 feels fatally miscalculated, a would-be genre deconstruction that explains way too much without understanding at all what it wants to say."
2," Better than we might expect, but in the end it's simply a noble addition to the lower ranks of thoughtful teen comedies."
0," Listless, formless stuff that never survives some serious miscasting."
0," It is quite impossible to set a film in the Paris catacombs and completely mess up the sense of grim, suffocating atmosphere... But do they come close."
2, Anyone who relishes seeing the reach and scope of the genre redefined should not miss this marvelously accomplished picture.
0," Despite a promising premise, Timeline proves to be nothing more than an utter waste of your own precious time."
0," While this had the potential to be a stirring cinematic experience, director Julie Taymor's trademark innovation and visual flair never soars."
0," ""The Congress"" becomes as frustrating and expensive-looking as ""Cloud Atlas."" Try to follow it and you may feel abandoned in a maze."
2, Bold attempt to present 'God as the ultimate headache' and Jesus (Willem Dafoe) 'as a metaphor for the human condition' (per Dutch Calvinist screenwriter Paul Schrader).
2, The movie takes us down an unexpected path with riveting skill and a refreshing lack of easy answers.
0, Collapses into a weary catalog of crime-movie cliches and political impossibilities.
2," Rarely has a movie so humorously illustrated the meaning of ""frenemy."""
0," There's building tension, and then there's cheaply toying with us. This movie is a prime example of the latter."
2," Compelling, revealing [its] subjects as sympathetic human beings simply by observing and talking to them about their work and their lives."
2," A smart, thought-provoking miniature piece."
2," A lean, mean old school sub thriller that could bring these movies back to the surface."
2," The hows and whys of the quest at hand aren't exactly important, as Central Intelligence is far more concerned with squeezing its leading men together-often literally-and kicking back to enjoy the juice, and that's a wise move."
2," ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is a hoot with heart."
0," A fascinating premise, some quirky characters and ravishing landscape cinematography eventually dwindle into nothing in this only fitfully interesting documentary."
2, Although boasting some nifty set pieces despite its lacklustre and cheap-looking computer-generated animation - can't touch the brilliance and storytelling skills of the films that Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks are turning out these days.
2, A philosophical journey through the mind of an aspiring artist trying to figure out who he is and where he belongs.
2," Owen and Wolff, and Chris Cooper in a brief but telling role, make it a worthwhile trip."
0," There's a great half-hour show rattling around in here somewhere, but the rest is padding at its very dullest."
2, A busy-looking catalogue of events that never adds up to a story.
2," The Matrix is a movie experience like no other, and experience is what it's all about. It explodes with dazzling visuals and a transcendent sense of excitement."
2," Simultaneously funnier, darker, and more emotional than its forebear."
0, A fairly goofy monster movie that manages to seem bloated even with a running time of less than 90 minutes.
0," Leatherheads a comedy of stock setups and kooky digressions in which nothing really comes to a head, and running at close to two hours, it lacks the essential brevity of the form."
0," Mill's towering righteousness is just too much for this weak little film, whose only interest is in affirming the white patriarchal prerogative."
0," Kate & Leopold is mostly harmless. Both Jackman and Ryan have a warm, delicate chemistry. Their affair is easily believable as the two delicately dance around love."
2, Angelina Jolie takes a conventional but confident approach to directing the amazing life story of Louis Zamperini.
0," This is a glum, lackluster movie in which even the big effects sequences seem dutiful instead of exhilarating."
2," Enjoyable comedy drama that succeeds thanks to likeable performances from Barnes and Sheehan, though the script occasionally struggles to find the right tone and it's not quite as funny as it thinks it is."
2, A real life spy thriller proving the truth is stranger than fiction.
0, It is ironic that Criminal - which features a maverick neuroscientist character and spins its nutty story around a pioneering brain operation - should prove to be such a brainless genre exercise.
0," Save for a pair of profound moments, don't be surprised if your mind frequently wanders off during Youth, despite all its weighty subjects arbitrarily hammered on screen."
0," One can't take Thirst seriously, even with its ironic cha-cha music cues, when Park sets up his usual elaborate sentimental ending -- further variation on his typical self-flagellation and mortification of the flesh."
2," It celebrates its modesty, it becomes our friend, we're surprisingly touched by it even though it doesn't rock us. If there is such a thing as a must-see three-star movie, here it is."
0," Aloha is the new Gigli. It's got a great cast, comes from a respected filmmaker, and was clearly subjected to so much reediting that you can scarcely even tell what the point was supposed to be anymore."
2, Kleiman seems less interested in explaining the whys of his scenario than in observing his characters and their interactions -- a strategy that pays off thanks to excellent lead turns.
2," German director Christian Petzold has come up with a splendid work of mourning and melodrama in ""Phoenix."""
2," Parents and grandparents shouldn't be surprised if, afterward, youngsters are sufficiently curious to Google info about the real-life Apollo moon missions that the movie playfully references."
2," Goes full Herzog into the abstract and esoteric, and that's what we love about Herzog."
2," Pratt proved in ""Guardians"" that he could handle hunky leading man roles, and his combination of physicality, charisma and attitude prove hard to resist one more time."
0, This asinine romantic comedy doesn't have an original bone in it's body.
2, [Sennia Nanua's] performance is worth the price of a ticket.
0, Did Harrison Ford hope the shorn look would give his high-tech mogul Jock Goddard some edge? He certainly needed something to.
2," It's good absurdist stuff, a little reminiscent of the work of Aki Kaurismäki, albeit without that filmmaker's wooly-headed whimsy."
0," The whole thing feels arbitrary. Henry and Clare's love is bedeviled not by anything they've done or have any control over, so the drama fails to build."
0," As vivid and relatable as the races, raft, wretchedness, and redemption may have been on the page, the on screen rendering manages to suck the life and vitality from Zamperini's ordeal."
0," Howard's intrusive score enhances the sense that Nightcrawler is a movie and nothing more. Which is fine, of course. But the movie's movie-ness makes you aware that a statement is being made without articulating what it is."
2," Besson is on his best behaviour, but he's so buttoned-up that his film is a little dull... Even imperfectly told, however, Aung San Suu Kyi's story remains astonishingly powerful and moving."
0," Is this a fun, flirty romantic comedy? A farce? A serious drama about espionage? When writer/director Tony Gilroy figures it out, will someone let me know?"
0, Looks like a nifty little sci-fi film noir but is actually a noisy mess.
2," If you've waited keenly through the two-and-a-bit years since the second film, you're likely to find the final chapter rewarding enough."
0, The film is charmingly light-hearted but incredibly formulaic. It could have been a big hit - about 25 years ago.
2," Can be a bit frantic and antic; the ending's more schmaltzy than Schulzy. But the sad-sack, what's-the-point-of-it-all? adult humour sneaks in. Pretty much the least disappointing feature-film adaptation America's most famous comic-strip could get. "
2, Polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own World War II experience in his signature style.
0," Rio, I Love You is totally the brainchild of a tourism board."
0," How to Lose is toothless, substituting broad humor and a romance for the needed cynicism."
0, A pale imitation [of Capra's films] that challenges credulity and tries too hard to win our hearts with schmaltz.
0," The movie should have been called 24 Blocks, one for each of its producers (a dubious all-time record?). However, when it comes to verbal and visual cliches, Donner's tired actioner has more than 26."
0," Lacking the fun, chemistry and emotional stakes of its predecessors, this X-Men installment is decidedly second class."
0," Another underwhelming crime biopic that goes out of its way to remind us that ""drugs are bad and crime doesn't pay."""
2," From production design to performances and choreography, Beasts of No Nation is a paragon of grim vibrancy. But where it brims over superficial drama, an original observation - something really scary - seldom finds its way to the screen."
2, Gory escapist war film.
0, It's less a narrative than a fistful of puzzle pieces thrown at an audience forced to fit them together.
0," Can't you just smell the pretension? Probably not, given the other ways in which this film stinks."
0, It's nearly impossible to sustain such flaky weirdness for 205 minutes.
0," This movie is bad. It's hilariously bad. The horror elements are wasted frivolously on silly jump scares including raccoons, dramatic grabbing of body parts, and every other horror trope in the book. "
0, [Finding Steve McQueen tells the story of] one of the most extraordinary robberies in history... although you don't believe it. [Full reviewin Spanish]
2," This documentary really dives into the Whitney that we thought we knew but didn't. It also answers so many questions that we've had for years about her sexuality, drug abuse, her marriage, her family. "
2," It's an amusing, wonderfully arranged sequel that brands the character as a cinematic force to be reckoned with, hopefully for the few more adventures to come. "
0," Although Hanks does everything to save it, the film ends up being tedious and over complicated, with gaps in logic and some irritating direction. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, Damsels in Distress is an exhilarating gift of a comedy.
0," After a while the movie's inside chumminess and the overgrown-boy schtick start to wear thin, making me wonder whether Sarah Silverman or Margaret Cho might consider filming a sequel with a busload of neurotic girlfriends."
0," People run. Things blow up. Sometimes, just to add another layer of nuance, people run away as things blow up."
0, It comes up short in both plot and quality.
0," The comedy revels in putting dumb and/or inept spins on cinematic formulas. It results in a shoddy movie, but one that is bad in rather interesting ways."
0, Tedious interpretation of the famous girl detective's adventures. Nancy Drew falls somewhere between The Haunted Mansion and the live-action Scooby Doo movies in terms of quality but is more irritating than either.
0, Sense becomes not a Michael Bay joint.
2," Megan Holley's script feels like it's been Sundance-workshopped to death. However, the cast - led by Amy Adams, Emily Blunt and Alan Arkin - establishes a vibrantly odd family bond that sustains ""Sunshine Cleaning"" through its dimmer portions."
0, One unavoidable issue here: the monotony of being restricted to computer screens for 90 minutes. 
2," Missteps apart, however, Monster remains a compelling dissection of a diseased young mind."
0," A frustrating viewing experience. The success of the superb book upon which it's based -- distilling the essence of disparate strands, and connecting them -- proves too difficult a lift for director Greg Barker."
2," Heady stuff, indeed, but perfect midnight-date movie fare if you're, uh, in the mood."
0, High school drama and alien wars become one and we get a movie that feels like it would be better suited as a CW television show than the kick-off to what Dreamworks/Touchstone quite obviously hopes will be a long term franchise
2," As far as Tarantino facsimiles go, it's a solid one, blending violence, humor and style to good effect."
2, Frank and revealing.
0, Action is mostly repetitive monologues about their power and dreams of rap stardom. Almost no one else speaks.
2," [The material] requires a light touch that sometimes eludes Falcone. But the intention is admirable, as is the focus on flawed female characters and the way they relate to each other."
0," Sam's duality ought to make for some interesting storytelling and a fascinating, conflicted character. But Forster and Butler overplay that conflict, turning ""Preacher"" into a portrait of goodwill gone amok."
0," The latest comic book adaptation is marred by contrived plotting, self-indulgent direction, a campy vibe and a weak villain."
2," Even without any proper dramatic scenes, this swirling collage of a movie draws us into its story and situations, revealing deep truths about relationships. "
2," I can't say that I was bored in The American, nor that the film is a waste of time. It was interesting enough, and it kept my attention."
0," Parker's approach is never dull, exactly. But it's never remarkable enough to overwhelm the suspicion that you're not being told a story here so much as being sold a career."
0," Unfortunately, Saskia Rosendahl plays the title character as an emotionless blank slate, while her siblings come off as brats, making it difficult to feel compassion for her physical and emotional struggles."
0, A real missed opportunity - a potentially groundbreaking film reduced to a mess fit only for the slack-jawed mallrats that it is being aimed...
2," In spite of its shortcomings, Destination Unknown has a cumulative power in upholding people who survived by believing in life and love."
0," A thoroughly unnecessary and disappointing sequel...marked by poor writing and slipshod construction, as well as flat directing and amateurish acting."
2, The film's last-chapter flood of confession and emotion is cathartic for the audience as well as the characters.
2, One of the most intelligent -- and strangely moving -- horror films ever made
2," The escalation of greed is a major factor in the film, and the unsettling aspiration of always wanting more - the ugly side of the American Dream - is rife."
2," [Moretz's] grounded, naturalistic presence goes a long way toward making mushy material palatable."
2," Like the mythical Diana (and as the title promises), our heroine is good with a bow, so expect much shooting of arrows and piercing of flesh. In other words, a good time."
0, Film theory students researching the sexual content of movies by women directors are probably the only viewers who will be satisfied...
0, How can we be uplifted by a James Brown classic when the singer in fact doesn't feel good but actually has a painful-looking spine condition?
2, The film is aided immeasurably by Judianna Makovsky's costume design. Clothes are an intentional method of deciphering The Hunger Games' politics.
2," As the first installment in 3-D, it's swashbuckling - if a bit shallow."
2," Merely good enough, rather than something spectacular."
2, I think this is a sweet movie.
0, A tone-deaf mix of live action and computer-generated animation that never engagingly clicks into gear.
0, 'Creaky Friday' is more like it...at its best the movie is no more than an amusingly retrograde retread of an idea that's been done all too frequently on the screen.
0," There's not much style here, beyond the uniformly good acting, and even less of a point."
2," As she changes, Deutch lets us see Sam's capacity for self-realization, compassion and common sense. It's all beautifully done with a first-rate musical score."
0," More than any other movie I can think of in the past few years, 'Doubt' was conceived of, and produced, for the sole purpose of winning Oscars. That's why it exists, and no, that's not a compliment."
0," No one's asking a low-priority contemporary robbery movie to be Rififi, but there's such a thing as striving for some kind of quality that will set you apart from the anonymous pack. And no one thought to do that here."
2," The documentary's lack of a cohesive thesis may frustrate at times, but its power lies in its exposition of the mundane."
0," An experience not unlike downloading a once trendy pop song on iTunes, only to discover it's been feebly re-recorded."
2," Mostly everything in the film, regardless of how contrived the set up, eventually rings true."
2," When Baumbach is on, he's really on, and the brilliant ""While We're Young"" contains the same self-lacerating humor as his ""Greenberg,"" ""Margot at the Wedding"" and ""The Squid and the Whale."""
0, Fails to utilize the full potential of its high-watt cast.
0, It's puzzling to watch someone present her own life in terms of cliché.
0," Ultimately, Ghostbusters supports the argument that Hollywood would rather recycle a known product for a guaranteed buck than take any real chances. And that's too bad because the people involved are capable of better."
0, The remake has a lot of energy; it just doesn't have a point.
0," Sadly, for a film at least partially about the impact of evening news and political coverage, little importance is given to the actual political content as compared to the results."
0, a commercial ripoff designed to confuse art-house patrons
2," Shipenko has created a claustrophobic and unrelentingly tense experience, further heightened by gorgeous cinematography, strong effects work, and a stirring score."
2, Theron's superlative acting in this supporting role fills out the storyline.
2," Waters does ground his film in the real world, and more importantly he creates a real sense of the family dynamics before Jared opens the door to the world of goblins and woodland creatures."
0, The International feels like a message in search of a movie.
2," The film does deliver on scares, and at a time when so few Hollywood horrors succeed on that front, we should grateful for the consistency of the Paranormal Activity films."
2, Ingmar Bergman's revived 2975 version of Mozart's opera makes an uncharacteristically playful film for him about what is essentially a custody battle fought on a metaphysical level.
2," Original, sorprendente, terrible, intensa. Un recuerdo de lo que el cine de terror y thriller debe ser, una historia que te atrapa, y te corta en pedazos."
2, What may be the summer's wittiest kids' flick.
2," It's definitely not a horror movie for everyone, but to give you an idea of what to expect, Truth or Dare feels like a 2028 version of Wish Upon, which is completely my kind of jam (and I'm totally cool with being in the minority here)."
0," A beguiling but only partly satisfying achievement for the ""less is more"" art house crowd."
0," Watchable, energetically directed thriller that doesn't quite come together, despite decent performances from Mackintosh and Walters."
2," Quietly haunting with beautifully shot dream sequences, Stigmata is a gorgeous story that will leave you thinking about it long after the last shot. "
2," Its only aim is to make us jump, make us laugh, and send us off with a thrilling final shot that's everything a ""Cloverfield"" fan could want from a prequel."
0," The subject is certainly worthy, but Singleton's script is too repetitive, pedantic, and protracted to do it justice."
0," A suspense film that attempts to make some statement about middle America, without ever really visiting."
0," There's a decent attempt to humanize the characters and make them more than mere fighting machines...but there are also potholes in the logic of the screenplay, by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick."
0, An incomprehensible mess.
2," Bring Bettany his racquet of burning gold, bring him his little green felt balls of desire."
0, The movie loses something by downplaying the book's arresting contrast between Stanton's smooth dishonesty and Picker's raw sincerity.
2," Since Johnston was prolific and a pack rat, director Jeff Feuerzeig had access to a life's worth of audio recordings, short films and animation dating back to the formative equivalent of the refrigerator art of Johnston's childhood."
2," It's good to see a film that doesn't try to diminish its Latin heritage, but embraces it in a universal story of love and friendship based on the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos"
0," Compared to Pixar's Up, a much more organic and heartfelt story about making friends in far-flung places, Rio simply feels rote."
2," A frisky, end-of-summer way to kill a couple of hours."
0," Months of Frances' life pass in minutes, yet those minutes feel like an eternity, thanks to non-action and uninspired editing."
2," Ranks in a class of haunted house tales alongside the original Haunting and The Others. But, you know, for kids."
0, The audience should be warned that the film boasts a cliche level that could be hazardous to health.
2, A LaBute movie turned inside out.
0," The final resolution of the plot is actually rather intriguing, but the journey to it is so slow and predictable that most moviegoers will have long since lost interest."
2," ""Hereditary"" is staged, photographed and acted so brilliantly, and brings up issues of motherhood, resentment and creativity with such subtlety, that it's tempting to overlook its alternately astonishing and laughable excesses."
2," As Bigelow has said, depiction is not endorsement, and ""ZDT"" shows the cost to the soul of fighting terrorism."
2, While Breakfast With Scot delivers the requisite humour -- not to mention some old-fashioned Christmas magic -- it stands apart for its hearty helping of food for thought.
2," The movie's screenplay is contrived and not blindingly original, but Barrymore illuminates it with sunniness, and creates a lovable character."
2," Charles Poekel displays an assured directorial hand and maintains a modest, appealing, even droll sensibility throughout."
2, A Slaughterhouse-Five adaptation starring the former First Lady. I'm pretty sure most people are going to hate it.
0," [It] feels like a retreat - into manufactured drama shellacked with sticky sentimentality, into risk-free storytelling full of coldly contrived conflict."
0," A salt-of-the-earth tale that'll play well in red states, but offers little spark."
0," The visuals and concepts presented here may be compelling and vital, but director Luc Jacquet weaves them together with too little urgency, propulsion and, ultimately, unique sense of purpose."
0," Spotty and slipshod, an unsteady, mostly vacuous excursion that not only shines a light on how much better ""Sin City"" did it, but virtually erases from memory with each passing scene."
2," It's a living, breathing freakshow in Pumping Iron."
2, A few inspired moments make up for a lot of missteps along the way.
2," Sarah Polley's brave quest to uncover her family's deepest secrets unfolds like a thriller, one where the resolution is literally part of her DNA."
2," What would possess a filmmaker to create another ""Exocist"" movie?"
2," It's not rated 'R' because of gore, sex or foul language - the usual suspects. No, 'The Conjuring' is rated 'R' because its paranormal-based violence is so ... creepy."
0, This laboured romantic comedy has little to recommend it beyond the picture-postcard locations.
0," ""Welcome to rock bottom"" says David Hasselhoff, reduced to badly emulating his role in Baywatch. He never spoke a truer word."
2," Buster Keaton's silent comedy Steamboat Bill, Jr. displays more inspired energy and inventiveness than pretty much everything else currently in cinemas combined."
0," Despite the surface sheen, and some enterprising plot twists, it doesn't entirely convince."
2, Ralph Fiennes is on great form as violent convict Magwitch and Helena Bonham Carter was born to play deranged jilted bride Miss Havisham.
2, Frederick Wiseman brings his insightful and layered filmmaking to one of America's most liberal institutions.
0," A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by cliches and predictability."
0, A better history lesson than it is a drama.
0," If you don't walk out in the first few moments, you deserve every gut wrench, gag reflex and skin crawl you get for the rest of the film."
0, Has any movie made during the past 20 years not presented female journalists as sluts?
0, This is what happens when filmmakers throw everything against a wall and see what sticks. A lot of it doesn't stick.
2," A solid, well-crafted and respectful chronicle of a terrible chapter in the war against Hitler."
2," Though in every respect a lightweight addition to the Marvel canon, the innocuous 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is mildly enjoyable. "
2," Body-swap movies such as Freaky Friday always make for good comedy, but Your Name, a gorgeous young-adult animation from Japan, takes the concept into more delicate, dreamlike territory."
2, The script needs more nurturing but Noomi Rapace takes up some of the slack in Pal Sletaune's maternal mystery.
0," Polanski and his Pianist scribe Ronald Harwood have chosen to tell it in as simple a manner as possible, as though they had been given a Masterpiece Theatre assignment to dispatch."
2, This spirited rendition of the Bard's comedy of sexual misadventures manages to reach across the centuries by using a modern setting but never commenting on it.
2," Despite its numerous and noticeable flaws, it's impossible not to be entertained by the lavish spectacle on display in Kong: Skull Island even if it lacks the heart and emotion that it aims for in certain scenes."
0," The broad and larky tone suits the early days of wide-eyed tours and Top of the Pops. But as the script frantically scrolls through the band's Wikipedia page, the cast rarely have the chance for more than mimicry."
0," If you like Maxim, you will love The Island."
2," This pleasing ensemble comedy, while manifesting Perry trademarks, is very much Ms. Chism's own. And that is to its benefit."
2," Like an old-school science-fiction flick, the film is surprisingly character driven until a final rousing action sequence, and that's all to the good. "
0, A disaster of Room-sized proportions.
2," Ultimately, the Jarmusch-Murray matchup, for all its flaws, offers a uniquely bittersweet experience, a movie with some broken funny bones and a questioning heart."
0, It's disappointing when movies made by adults treat kids -- as characters and viewers -- with disdain.
2," Margin Call opts to show us that there are no heroes and villains, only villains and victims and poor souls weighing the merits of a Faustian bargain."
0, The Best of Me is quite possibly the worst Nicholas Sparks adaptation ever committed to film. 
0," And maybe God does forgive Nicolas Winding Refn for this error of judgment of a film, but the Cannes festival audiences didn't"
0, The problem may be that Mendes is trying to offset the inherent pulpiness of the series by playing up the class.
0, The promising beginning goes unrealized.
2," It's shaggy, overlong, and sometimes tough to take, but ultimately if one can listen or read between the bars being spit, Bodied is smart and worthwhile viewing."
0," Roald Dahl's implausible script is padded out with the usual exotic locations, stunts, and trickery."
2," Clearly Coppola has talent and ideas, and she's also the kind of filmmaker who seems most comfortable imposing a particular aesthetic vision and structure on her work."
2," Since Source Code is philosophical science fiction and not just 'sci fi,' there's something to chew on here about consciousness: when it begins and ends, and that old chestnut of what constitutes reality. [Blu-ray]"
2, Farfetched plotting nearly capsizes this globe-trotting thriller but director Doug Liman certainly keeps the international intrigue and testosterone flowing at an entertaining clip.
0, [It's] the sort of intellectually offensive children's movie one would make if one knew nothing about children.
0, Parental Content Review
2," Even at its slower moments, Julia's Eyes is a classy and lovely horror film to look at."

2, What fools these mortals be -- especially anyone who passes up Michael Hoffman's highly entertaining version of Shakespeare's famous comedy. 
2, [Eastwood] appears to be in the middle of a Luis Bunuel-sized career renaissance.
0, The movie lacks sufficient build-up to make us care about his journey until it's already over.
0, What we need are some cinematic repo men to rip this movie from the theaters.
2, We get vested in the lives of these characters. That's rare in a lot of movies. We come to understand how they think and care about what they decide.
0, Eight-Legged Freaks runs out of gas scarily fast -- its one-joke premise lends itself more to a short than a feature.
2, Cyril Raymond manages to invest the stodgy character with a lovable quality.
0," The script has a dubious source, taken from a memoir by Elliot Tiber that, based on this evidence, does nothing to scrape the rust off Woodstock's mythic cliché."
2," If band names like Circle Jerks, D.O.A., Dead Kennedys and Minor Threat resonate with you, then this documentary celebrating their short-lived, pummeling breed of thrash-and-burn rock music will surely get your blood boiling all over again."
2," The type of metaphysical mediation on marriage, love, and death that insists, allows, and rewards introspection."
2, The Babadook lures you in with the familiar childhood fears about something lurking under your bed but delivers something fresh and even surprising.
0," A movie that feels scribbled in pencil crayon, drenched in Jolt cola and coated with the dust of a thousand discarded bags of Flamin' Hot Cheetos... As it is, Deadpool 2 is a film that is merely aggressively aggressive."
2," I was completely immersed in Leave No Trace. The pacing is perfect and while I tend to believe that 2 hours is too long for most films, this one never dragged."
0," An overstuffed, undercooked cash grab, operating at the low level of a basic cable sit-com with a juiced-up laugh track"
0," Towelhead makes ""American Beauty"" look like a quaint suburban drama."
2," It's the next best thing to being there, in that it's likely to make shuddering viewers intensely glad that they weren't."
2, Delivers to both food snobs and fast-foodies who can digest smart entertainment.
0, Like something imagined by Turgenev during what would have been even for him one of his more bleak interludes.
0," She's Out of My League doesn't answer the question of whether a 20 would go for a 5, but rather if audiences are willing to settle for a 5."
2," As Thana, Warakulnukroh radiates a sense of unadorned humanity, coupling a sense of being lost with the desire to be of service."
2, The director demonstrates an unlimited trust in his actors... [Full review in Spanish]
0," In terms of narrative and character arc, Venom is an absolute disaster."
0," ""MFKZ"" is obviously modeled on Katsuhiro Ôtomo's ""Akira"" and Taiyô Matsumoto's ""Tekkonkinkreet,"" but it lacks the gritty brilliance of the former and the underdog poignancy of the latter."
2," The drama feels heightened and overwrought, and yet it works; you can see Nina's cold-eyed desperation, and Lou's creepy rapture as he realizes that he can get a shot that nobody else has."
2," Smutty, short and sweet."
2," Huppert is brilliant. She's long combined a roiling emotional reservoir with careful technique; feelings play across her delicate, almost translucent face like clouds reflected in a windowpane."
0," In this overly literal adaptation, we know invisible forces are at work only when characters directly address their presence."
0," The beautiful animation and wonderful character design continue to impress, but the seafaring action is sunk by sub-sitcom-level lessons about family and friendship."
2," If you're looking for a deeper analysis of obsession, you've come to the wrong place. If you're looking for an affirmation that liking what you like is totally fine, then this is the movie for you."
2," Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts is simple at a glance, nuanced under scrutiny, and is a damn fine time at the movies."
2," Lady Bird's unvarnished, unglamorized high-school drama has the quirky humor one expects from Gerwig...Ultimately, it's a mother-daughter love story, replete with the tribulations of painful individuation."
0," I don't have any significant complaints about the film, but if I didn't see it I don't think I would have missed anything special."
0, It's difficult to care about anybody.
0," Haneke keeps us at arm's length. Guided more by intellect than heart, his story flattens instead of sharpens."
2," Scott Eastwood's good ol' boy Southern gentleman is sweetly charming. He's perfectly matched with Britt Robertson, who has grown since the under-appreciated CW Network series Life Unexpected."
0," Massive sets, lavish costumes, outstanding special effects and a cast of thousands can't keep this wannabe epic fantasy from tumbling down."
0," The mooted Stooges - Sean Penn, Jim Carrey, Benicio del Toro - dodged a bullet judging by this muddle of creaky slapstick and laugh-free plotting."
2," It is an epic inspired by the tradition of Kurosawa and Lean, mixed with more than a bit of the fantasy of The Wizard of Oz."
0," One of those could-have-been-worse movies. But it also could have been much, much better."
0," The end credits, which seem almost as long as the movie itself, dementedly thank everyone from the citizens of Pennsylvania to William Wyler, Howard Hawks and God. What an insult."
0," Rather than gain speed and power in its final act, as Joseph's design comes into play, the movie stalls."
0," Budgetary constraints tell throughout. Although shot in Serbia, for long stretches Extinction might have been filmed in a cardboard box with a dry ice machine."
2," ""A Dangerous Method'' presents a vivid portrait of pre-World War I Europe that's at a considerable remove from the types of madness usually seen in Cronenberg's films."
2," The year's most fascinating and frightening doc so far, The Imposter delves far beneath the hysterical tabloid headlines."
2," Reluctant to film the great work, Sangsoo continues to explore the fusion of film and life camouflaging the complexity of lightness. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," As it slides wearily into worn-out sex thriller conventions, Chloe becomes tedious and mechanical. When it's over, you're left feeling kind of cheap."
2, It's not the simplest thing to take a character as embedded in our culture as Batman and make wickedly irreverent fun of him while simultaneously paying tribute to his storied past and keeping him likable for the next round.
0," Visually, sonically, and tonally, 227 Hours is too often at odds with itself in competing for our attention. "
2," Zellweger's performance had all the curves of real life. Hugh Grant gave the most restrained, game free performance I've seen for him in a while. And Colin Firth was drier than any martini."
0, There's a kind of grand awfulness about it.
0, The action sequences are the prize attraction and even they leave something to be desired.
2," A one-of-a-kind, sweet-and-salty bitser."
2," As a remake it's not as poetic as Wenders' masterpiece Wings of Desire, but it's supremely mounted (by ace lenser John Seale) and contains touching performances from Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan deviating from their respective screen images."
0," Oblique, unstructured and demented, Winter's Tale aims to cast a dreamlike spell, but it's more like a nightmare."
2," Delivered with humour and pathos, this is a literary film in more ways than one. ... Those who find pleasure in the written word will discover much to enjoy here."
0," The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored, cheering the pratfalls but little else; their parents, wise folks that they are, read books."
0, Drug dealer biopic wants to be a fun ride but is undone by hipper-than-thou direction and a maddeningly opaque central performance by Rhys Ifans.
2," Malick's typically unhurried and measured pace is wholly appropriate for The New World, which expresses the awe of discovery and re-invents no less than the popular myth of our country's founding."
2," As with all of Herzog's nonfiction efforts, it's spellbound by the wonder of man's relationship to his surroundings."
2," Audacious, powerful and consistently entertaining, which is not always the case with von Trier's difficult work."
2, St. Vincent is the most complete performance of Bill Murray's career.
2," Perhaps when the uproar has died down it will be discovered that the film is not quite so good as it is considered now, but nevertheless Hollywood will for a long time be in debt to Mr. Welles."
2," Shot in glorious black-and-white in unforgiving terrain, The Juniper Tree is a mood piece first and foremost, with a sense of natural mysticism not unlike a Peter Weir film. "
0," An underpowered, white-bread sermon on the importance of family and faith."
2," In Shyamalan's inventive meta-psychodrama, it's 23 (or so) characters in search of an author."
0, Carrey's mugging glosses over some tough issues.
0," As a summer- holiday outing to the cinema, this is strictly one for a rainy day."
0," While not lacking for lamentations from women or anybody else, primarily concentrates on the ""crush your enemies"" part. The movie fails because it can't make that gore interesting"
2, Denis Villeneuve's tormented family drama strips off one layer of meaning after another on its way to a thoroughly jolting terminus.
2," Slow, beautiful Ida is more impressive cinematically than narratively"
0, The Farrellys' sentimental streak cuts into their unabashedly tasteless humor -- and leaves Stuck on You stuck in a rut.
2," Scenes take on a surreal nightmare quality, sometimes with no accompanying sound, as even the camera seems dazed by what it is witnessing."
2, Bittersweet and heartbreaking; words can't describe the simultaneous emotional devastation and wide-smiled happiness induced by the ending
2," For all of its precise direction and beautiful imagery, it's a classic genre picture, and a damn good one at that..."
0," ... Souvenir tries to package its kitsch as dressed-up fun, but all it does is give Isabelle Huppert something to do between her real movies."
0," It doesn't feel like a cohesive piece, so while it's at times charming, and does get off the ground in the last act, the getting there is extremely bumpy. "
0," I can digest a certain amount of importance-of-family sap, but I expect something in return."
2," This is a finely crafted, visually sumptuous film with fine performances all round. "
2, Maybe Warner Bros. should make all their DC movies with Legos?
0," Leaves you feeling the film has somehow missed its mark, copping out with a mealymouthed, almost relativistic reading of the cosmic conundrum it has presented us with ..."
0," If you didn't know that Jack Kerouac's novel... was a seminal influence on postwar America... you would never, ever guess it from this lifeless, soulless, pointless adaptation."
2," Me Before You the movie, as directed by Thea Sharrock, is better than the book because it dispenses with the idea of understanding anyone's internal motivations."
0, The film is like a hooker dressed up as a lady: It wants to pretend it has class.
0," Between Kunis' miscasting and Raimi's heavy hand, Oz the Great and Powerful is ultimately robbed of its emotional power and its chance at cinematic greatness."
0, Surely a figure as crucial as Geldzahler deserves more incisive treatment.
2," This may be fundamentally Saturday night entertainment, but Scott attempts rather more than that on occasion, and at least succeeds in creating a memorable sense of a dark and often frightening period of time."
0," From what I can tell, Emily Rose died from a terminal case of bad screenwriting. "
0," Freeman and Nicholson make the most of Justin Zackham's script, but there just isn't enough substance behind their characters to prop up the carpe diem platitudes."
2," Body of War makes no bones about its activism. Then again, like the others, it's the willingness to contextualize events and apply reason to them that makes it and others so valuable."
2, Perpetually off-balance and maybe just a little too satisfied with its cynicism
2," Romanian castles and catacombs define The Nun's tremendous location characteristics, which are inherently spooky when used to heighten a more ""generic"" brand of horror than Conjurverse films are used to."
2," Leticia and Hank come together in their grief, and when they do - when, in particular, they seek some kind of punishment and absolution in sex - it makes for one of the most intense, moving and real moments you're ever likely to witness on film."
0, Tedious Days. Van Sant's non-linear style getting tired.
2," Spielberg remains the consummate storyteller, even if the material he has chosen to work with simply doesn't pack the emotional wallop of a ""Schindler's List""......"
0," Ed Helms and company seem like they're mocking middle-America vanilla-ness, which is ripe for mocking, but they also want to embrace it with a cuddly ending. "
2," Carefully accumulates and juxtaposes details to form an interconnected web of loneliness, regret, and longing for happier times gone by."
0," An intriguing cinematic spectacle: an awful film that seems aware - nay, aggressively boastful - of its own awfulness."
2," It may sound as if the movie is only for 23-year-old boys, or the Marvel faithful, but it isn't."
0," Undoubtedly, Loznitsa uses Krotkaya as an emotional discharge, a kind of ideological exorcism. But what fault do we have? [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Brightly animated with likeable characters and a strong voice cast, but the plot feels weak and, some inspired animal-food gags aside, it lacks the wit, invention and pace of the first film."
0, Maybe this movie is a mess because America is too? Maybe there are better ways to spend your time?
2," Tatum's dancing (at one point, he exits a room doing a head roll and a suave little twirl) keeps things bright. Somebody needs to cast this guy in a musical - he'd be magic."
2," The film is best appreciated as an open-ended 'fictional documentary' rather than a conventional feature with a beginning, middle and end."
0," It's meant to be dumb, summer fun. They got the ""dumb"" part right, and it is summer, but what with the unpleasant characters and inane twists, they forgot to supply the fun."
2," The premise is as simple as a biblical parable, and as densely packed with significance."
2, There's enough talent on display to make one wonder what the director will do next.
2," A fun, scary and slick popcorn movie."
0, It really is almost impressive how bad this is.
2," With its stately crane shots and plaintive score, The Vow feels as unabashedly sentimental as those melodramas, but resists the cloying impulse to manufacture tragedy for easy tears."
2, The strength of Boorman's film is that it reminds us of what a service comedy is-the spectacle of cogs rising up against their machine.
2," ""Frantz"" is pleasurable slow going, developing its themes at an amble but with a measure of suspense, sympathy toward its characters, and a lasting faith in filmmaking craft."
0," 20,000 Miles' script is so flooded with [clichés] it derails what is otherwise a gorgeously shot film with plenty of picturesque locations and strong performances."
2," It isn't the movie of the year, but it is the surprise of the summer."
0," It's stolid, it's dogged, it knows where it's going. Back and forth around the same old scenery."
2," An empathetic, sincere and compassionate film, a chronicle of achievement crucial for a time in which many are desperate for an inspiring story."
2," before its disappointing dénouement, Monkey Shines is a very tense thriller concerned precisely with one man's struggle to tame his older, wilder instincts. "
2," Miyazaki's flying contraptions are a sight to behold, rivaled only by the film's epic sweep and nonstop parade of action set-pieces."
0," By and large, I try to avoid spoilers, but once you get past The Perfect Guy's obviously ironic title, there's nothing left to spoil."
2," So as long as you're aware watching Hope Springs is a little like being in therapy yourself and having the occasional laugh, you'll find this film rewarding."
2," A bold, mesmerizing and journey into a land of shadows and mystery that will leave a deep and unnerving impression."
0," Some decent impersonations, but tries too hard to make everything feel meaningful."
2," Come February, it might be very fashionable to present Streep with another Oscar"
2," Terrence Malick's long awaited meditation on spirituality, loss and innocence stars Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain as a 2950's couple who - along with their eldest son Jack (Sean Penn) - struggle with the big questions of the meaning of life. "
0," Americons is like The Wolf of Wall Street without the skill, depth, nuance, humor, or poignancy."
0," John Huston is the wrong director, lacking appreciation for the musical genre"
2," ...she successfully conveyed much of her emotion through her eyes, posture and full lips."
2, A potent mix of testosterone and adrenalin and action fans of all ages should be happy to hand over their green.
2, Exaggeration works for Sky High.
2," It ain't art, but it sure is a good time for anyone who enjoys the occasional bit of bone-crunching entertainment. "
2, An eye-opening eco-documentary.
0," It contains approximately twice the laughs of ""Sex and the City 2"" and half the number of bitches."
2," A deeply unsettling film, the kind of horror movie that pulls from relatable human emotions like grief and resentment to ultimately become an absolute nightmare."
0, A bottom-feeding mess. Everyone involved has done much better work and would likely like to forget about this 
0," The problem with the film, which somewhat inexplicably won the Golden Bear at Berlin last year, is that it scarcely transcends the basic novelty of its premise."
2, You're unlikely to find a more harrowing documentary this year than Diving Into The Unknown.
2," The Square is a brilliant examination of the motivations of our own personal morality, and a truly amazing comedy."
2, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story does exactly what it is supposed to do by incrementally expanding the Star Wars universe that we already know.
2, [It] harnesses knife-taking-life clichés to produce a merry ride of Halloween silliness with far more chuckles than chills
0," Granted, it's a glorious idea, though Dumont is hardly the director to do it, and the result feels outrageous on all accounts: a blasphemous assault on French history, religion, and the musical genre."
2," A watery, ladylike, and extremely tall tale indeed, but one well within the reach of its fine cast (which this time includes its director)."
0," Not even an amiable central performance from Taylor Schilling...and some early atmospheric mood-setting can save this ""demon child"" knock-off from its ineptitude. "
2," This is precision entertainment, a crackling, pulse-pounding heist movie with a sterling cast, a whip-smart script, and undeniable social resonance, calling to mind heavyweight champs like The French Connection and Heat."
2," The film delivers on every level of the emotional scale. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you want to scream."
2," At a brisk 86 minutes it never stops being entertaining,"
2," Pandora is so immersive, its native cultures so well realized that any fantasy novelists watching will surely weep from the world-building gauntlet thrown down. Top this!"
0," As for the prominent leitmotif, Franz Liszt's Liebestraum (Love Dream), it just serves to stir up yearnings for something deeper and artistically satisfying, instead of, alas, leaving us with an illusive dream."
0," Should be re-titled ""The Limits of a Moviegoer's Patience as a Mystery Man Eats Paper While Showing Amazing Restraint Lying Next to a Naked Girl""."
0," With some dire blue-screen effects, dizzying tonal instability and a total absence of suspense or originality, 'Wolverine' is something of a disaster."
2," Gallo's haunting, evocative baby has an almost slow-motion, depression-in-action vibe. I don't think I could ever sit through it again--but I'm glad it exists."
2," ""April and the Extraordinary World"" is a visual delight, an animated French steampunk adventure that is smart, exciting and wonderfully weird."
0, A watered-down likeness that curiously turns disaster flick in its too-scary third act.
0," Pawn Shop Chronicles goes from curious to overkill in a hurry, cementing the director's reputation as a fire hose of a filmmaker, perhaps biologically incapable of subtlety."
2," A stylish, witty, imaginative diversion."
0," It all feels like a ridiculously expensive, high-stakes reality-show scavenger hunt, with a preposterously contrived plot twist. "
0, An OK blockbuster that looks expensive but lacks truly epic or visually spectacular moments. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Third time's a charm. Ocean's Thirteen outshines the second installment, offering that certain breezy fun the original provided. Those cutie pies just work better in Vegas."
2," Still manages to rouse spirits, in spite of everything."
2," Berlinger's work has revealed the warped wheels of the American justice system before, garnering a groundswell of support for the West Memphis Three. With ""Whitey,"" he's casting an ever wider net."
2, A winning work whose charms far outweigh any pitfalls.
0," It deserves to be buried in obscurity--if not burned beyond recognition--along with other comedies of its ilk, including Carbon Copy, He's My Girl, Soul Man and Chu-Chu and the Philly Flash."
2," Aimed at creating a soldiers' eye-view of the four-year conflict, the result is a stunning piece of cinema."
2," A quirky, artistic triumph."
2," As a companion piece to the illuminating documentary RBG it will suffice, but you can't help wanting it to be as remarkable as its subject. "
0," ""To the Wonder"" is a trailer for itself, although it could be mistaken for a high-end perfume commercial ..."
0," Not as bad as the 'Da Vinci Code', but is not even entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, only works as mindless entertainment.
0, Dawn of Justice's aim of reshaping our image and understanding of Batman is squandered under the weight of its incoherent and undisciplined narrative.
0," [I]f you want a moving account of kids coming-of-age with an SFF twist, you'd be better off just screening The Goonies or E.T. at home."
0, The idea that Santa Claus... is getting the life lessons and not giving them is the surest indicator of how crass this movie is.
0, There are a lot of people local and abroad responsible for this dismal film.
0," A quite breathtakingly inept hodge-podge of vapid spirituality, playground chopsocky and visual effects that take 3D to an entirely new level: Zero-D."
2, The story moves forward at a brisk pace and there's enough element of surprise and suspense in Bhaagamathie.
0," This is so bad, it's good. This is a real disaster."
0, Rarely has a film so tediously built to a climax this underwhelming.
2," An incredibly immersive experience that is hard to shake after the credits role, a film that illuminates and moves in its artistry and its spirit."
2," After the weight of expectation awaiting The Da Vinci Code, this is a more enjoyable affair and relaxed affair - a sort of National Treasure for grown-ups."
0," Never quite comes together. You keep waiting for it to gel, but it just drifts along until it drifts away."
0," Transphobia and misogyny flow through the film as much as blood, staining what might have been a solid genre effort."
2," You leave the theater smiling, but also with a question: That's all, folks?"
0, Ben Stiller has created a movie about how cool Ben Stiller is.
2, Your blood will curdle and boil.
0," All About Nina has little, if anything new to say about the self-loathing, narcissism, and insecurities that belie many funny people, and the switch from a leading man to a leading woman adds shockingly little value. "
0, It's rare for a biopic to deliver so little insight into its subject.
2," A remarkable downer-upper paradox: a bruising tale of teenage resilience, honest and emotionally complicated and alive."
2," While Solo is not the greatest Star Wars film, it is certainly a good one."
2," As with fights, we understand at all times what we're seeing; Surprises aren't the result of whim or betrayal to the logic of the story. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Disney and director Andrew Stanton may have dusted off the creaky franchise and wrapped it in $300 million worth of 3-D digital effects, but the final product still feels like ancient history."
2, White Boy Rick exudes empathy for its titular character and his situation. 
2, The spirit of exploration and discovery lives in Interstellar and that alone makes it a cinematic trip worth taking.
0," It was only at its best when it had some sly fun with, rather than trying to ape, 007 tropes. Now, in parachute-troops Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and company aren't so self-satisfied this go-around. "
0, It's more entertaining than reading a Wikipedia entry but nevertheless stays pretty bland throughout. 
0, A bold experiment which doesn't quite come together.
2," In the midst of it all you almost take for granted the carefully rendered details of the setting, the tightness of the editing and the inventiveness of the special effects."
0," Redacted, director Brian DePalma's ugly little Iraq War movie, wastes an interesting approach on trite, crude and painfully superficial content."
2, This is a one-of-a-kind documentary.
2," An artsy thriller that continuously reveals new layers and plays off the intertwined notion of what's real, what's a memory and what's manipulation. (Complete Content Details for Parents also available)"
2," Mulligan doesn't have the aura of unattainability that Julie Christie did in the 2967 film version of ""Far from the Madding Crowd,"" but her earthier appeal feels truer to the character and less like the idealized vision of a masculine imagination."
2," It's an inspiring, uplifting - if sentimental - docudrama, pulling the heartstrings with the best of intentions."
0, The debut feature by Josie Rourke is a well-constructed but dull costume movie that wages its 26th-century drama between battling English queens as a feminist struggle.
0," The narrative loses almost all momentum as it haphazardly staggers from one uninspired plot device to the other, displaying clear signs of an undercooked, chaotic screenplay."
0, Why the screenwriters allowed this movie to take a nonsensical turn is 'Unknown.'
2, One leaves The Pervert's Guide to Ideology with a lingering sense that this is how academic essay films should be done in the 22st century.
2, Cinematic poetry and one of the best films of the year.
0," Lacking tension in its setting and empathy for its characters, 88 Minutes is a woeful excuse of a thriller thanks to the inept direction by Jon Avnet, who has forgotten to inject emotion and thrills in what can only be described as a bloated crime movie. "
0," Leap years come round every four years, but dispiriting romcoms appear with depressing inevitability at least four times every year, and this is one of the very worst."
2," While Hedwig occasionally lapses into a kind of pop sappiness, it's also upfront about all that, declaring its faith in the mythology of love, its capacity to 'create something that wasn't there before.'"
2, The action is characteristically stylish and breathtakingly fast. 
2," Be patient. Arrival falls just short of perfect thanks to an expositional hiccup midway through the film and a climax that hinges on a borderline-hokey revelation, but the end will more than justify these ever so slightly sloppy means."
2," Continuing themes of snow and tides populated with birds (including two combative crows who make multiple appearances), horses, cows, wolves and deer give us a perception of the author's soul, the types of images which moved him."
2, This unlikely ménage-a-trois has created an offbeat romance of remarkable warmth and credibility.
0, A very simplistic Dystopia for Dummies - with a bit of Terrence Malick for Dummies thrown in - and inoffensive enough until it devolves into all kinds of stupid.
0," With the domino pieces in place, the plot then coasts along rather predictably."
2," With its silly, glittery costumes and warring stars, this basically does for magic what Blades Of Glory did for ice skating. "
0," Unlike last year's Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which felt fresh and contemporary, Whatever Works seems dated. Allen has covered these themes so often that they provide few surprises."
2," Few filmmakers have created such personal, expressive art, and few other films invite the viewer to be as active a participant in the quest for meaning."
0," The often-awkward original is worth about a tenth of its considerable reputation, yet when compared to Zombie's version it actually looks good."
2," The film leads to no showy conclusion, no spectacular climax. It is about movement possible within the soul even in difficult times."
0," You're left thinking that the most interesting stuff was what happened immediately after ""the discovery,"" the part of the yarn that the film skips over."
2, The thing you learn from this in-depth doc is how much of a trail he blazed.
0," The score feels cribbed, the action is video-game superficial and the costuming came directly from Forever 22."
0," There's not enough real transition on the part of Daisy, despite the work Ronan puts in, but that's not enough to make this end-of-the-world movie the end of the world."
2, Begins with a scream and ends with the best goosebump-inducing finale since The Sixth Sense.
2," Whereas other films might make Ziki and Kena's trials tell a story of queer suffering, Kahiu's is one of sweetness."
2," The score is good, with lots of Beethoven, who, not surprisingly, is Dot's favorite composer."
0," The 9th Life of Louis Drax had potential to be so much more, but the wondrous story at its core is populated with dull and, ironically, lifeless characters. "
2," While conspiracy theorists won't find much to appreciate or explore in Parkland, the lay person will get a sense of the emotional devastation caused over those four days in 2963."
0," Nicholas Sparks is a talentless hack whose storytelling managed to hit a stride with modern audiences. They amount to nothing more than romance novels, and not even good ones."
2, You're not likely to see a more impassioned and heartfelt tribute to the joy of reading.
0, Falls flat within today's comedic standards.
2," So truthful and engaging that you feel part of the class, sitting at a desk in the room as the events slowly unfold."
0," Pretty amusing when the director apes Hitchcock, and pretty awful when he apes himself."
2," The two stars make a great looking couple, and their characters seem to genuinely care about each other."
0, One of the flattest romantic comedies this year.
0," Where is the climax? Where is the suspense there? Where the emotion? The story that was so applauded three summers ago has lost all dimension, all its fabulous dimension. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0, The bait and switch marketing could have been forgiven if The Secret Life of Pets itself felt creative enough when the story leaves home
0," [Koolhoven] presumably, intends to create a debate about women being rendered mute by men and religion, but sets about it in the most crass and on-the-nose way - via scold's bridles and tongue removal - never exploring the theme beyond the physical."
2," When it's just Andre and Chelsea, wandering the streets of New York and getting to know each other, Top Five is as good as Rock has ever been on-screen."
2, Story inspired by historical events that illustrates the process whereby enemies can become friends.
2," The film, an indictment in part of the culture's fascination with the lurid details of cases like these, is harrowing, wrenching and redemptive."
2," Daring the discomfited viewer to laugh at shame and suffering, and then wonder why we're laughing, Todd Solondz is back."
0, You've been warned.
0, The contrast between this grisly reality and the way it's framed as jingoistic spectacle makes a satiric point that's a bit too obvious to be effective.
2, You don't need to be a baseball enthusiast to enjoy Late Life. Anyone who appreciates human drama will be rooting for Wang.
0," It all feels half-arsed - you'll be so bored at times you'll find yourself wondering if the rock placement in a jungle scene looks too fake (it does, by the way)."
2, Good Kill could've used more conflict and drama sprinkled throughout the narrative...
2," We know what will happen, of course, but Jacquot still manages to create tension, as well as a semi-soap opera, among the let-them-cake-eaters of post-Enlightenment France."
0," These are all good reasons to root for Carol as she becomes the newest member of the MCU. But Captain Marvel doesn't highlight any of them in a rousing, snappy way."
2," This isn't SyFy Thor, it's HOLLYWOOD Thor! Crummy costume and set design is made up by being full of heart and soul."
2," Tsang approaches the material from a rather standard place, but it's a lot darker and weirder than it wants to admit."
2," Whatever you may feel about Luca Guadagnino's remake of Dario Argento's Suspiria - whether you love it or hate it, find bits of it dull and other bits illuminating - you really have never seen anything like it."
2, The scary specter of all-out Holy War as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
2," An entertaining, albeit eclectic and eccentric, mélange."
0," As usual, Edward Zwick stumbles upon a really good idea for a movie, and then so thoroughly botches the execution that you're ashamed to still be sitting in the theater after two and a half hours."
0, Making copy editors' lives everywhere easier: The Goods doesn't deliver.
2," Hansen-Løve keeps Nathalie purposefully in flux and on the move, Denis Lenoir's camera constantly catching her striding hither and yon, proceeding as briskly as the film itself."
2," Brave starts as a light and airy fable, but its mood rapidly turns Brothers Grimm dark and delivers a resounding moral of personal responsibility and consequences for actions."
2," What happens when a rigorously non-mainstream filmmaker tries to reverse-engineer a mainstream romantic comedy? The result, in all its charming perversity, is ""Results."""
0," The film will satisfy fans of the series, but that's all it does. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0, I have nothing but contempt for the artist who presumptuously assumes that his work is worthy of your tears and that you are emotionally and intellectually incapable of resisting his preening machinations.
0," An overblown, unrelenting movie that tries to disguise its ludicrous plot with enough technical jargon to make it all appear feasible."
0, What pushes Mr. Brooks into 'silly' territory is the way co-writer/director Bruce A. Evans piles on way too many subplots that seem to set up future stories.
0," Plot twists that might have played as clever onstage feel false on screen, and while the individual actors are all gifted (if in some cases miscast), they never really come together as an ensemble."
2," For devotees, this is an enriching way to spend three-plus hours."
2," There's no doubt that the imaginary world [Gilliam has] created is awe-inspiring, but it's ultimately designed for an art house audience."
0," If too much charm can kill, this emotionally manipulative nostalgic love letter to cinema directed and written by the 32-year-old Giuseppe Tornatore is a killer."
0, It may be the most staggeringly perfunctory piece of filmmaking I have ever seen.
2, A sports film with an arthouse sensibility. It benefits greatly from its chosen subject matter - two of the most remarkable characters in sporting history - but only manages to truly get under the skin of one of them.
2, Genial but lackluster romantic comedy.
2," Abundant in charm and loose-limbed energy, it's a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, possessing everything one wants from a big Hollywood studio action-comedy."
0, The remarkable Ice Age setting is all that distinguishes - and not by much - a depressingly conventional boy-and-his-dog story.
0, Lifetime movie with English accents.
2, The Future Is Written is a loving testimonial to one of rock's true originals.
2," Whatever your beliefs, ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a film to be seen and, more importantly, discussed."
0," It combines elements of classic heist movies, but a poor script leaves it far from being a good addition to the genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Based on a true story, it's not difficult to figure out this will unravel, but watching it and Cruise's performance in the process offers much enjoyment."
2," Glory is a sophisticated, well-made, all-too-real satire - a chilling contemporary snapshot - that's very well worth seeking out."
2, ...the sequel has come close to rivaling the original and you will leave ready to see it all again. I don't imagine I'll be writing that compliment often this summer.
0," A half-hour of brilliance, preceded by an hour of dreck?a roughly comparable dreck-to-brilliance ratio to the first two Rush Hour movies, I guess, and par for the course for Jackie's Hollywood films."
2," Despite some notable flaws, Deadpool is just what superhero cinema needs. It's a shot of adrenaline directly into the Marvel nervous system."
2, Nothing if not visceral
2," It's still a striking piece of character-driven horror, and it still ranks (despite the effects) among the more understated fright fests to hit the mainstream in recent memory."
2, This performance reminds us that Bridges is that rare actor who has never had to make that apology. Crazy Heart lets him be every bit as grand as we'd hope him to be.
0, High craft in the service of an oppressively dull story.
2, The Help works best in its quieter moments.
2, One of the best films that will be released in 2024.
2," This movie contains all the elements that make this genre enjoyable despite a cynic's better judgment: it's a simple, exuberant spectacle of colour, rhythm, and romance."
2, An engaging yet far-from-flawless modern musical...
2," It pummels forward like the train on which the action is set, and you don't particularly want to reach the end."
0," Slater, who in certain shots looks curiously like Kevin Costner, is an actor with talent, but he is too young for this role, and not confident enough to dial down a little."
0, Can never quite muster the interest or ability to make us look past the inherent ridiculousness of its premise. 
2," You'll come out of this knowing more about Cobain's self-destructive talent, and lifelong depression, than a more conventional treatment could offer."
0," Like so many animated movies these days, it buries its ideas in a visual and aural cacophony of frenzied action sequences designed to engage the shortest of attention spans."
2," It's an erotic, Cold War-esque spy thriller that once again shows us why Lawrence continues to earn her status as the go-to Hollywood 'It' girl. "
0," Didn't anyone notice that the story made no sense, that it was just remnants of Short Circuit, E.T., WarGames and other better movies, strung together more or less at random? "
2," Forget 2996's often-confusing series kickoff. Even without the lit match and fuse, this sequel is a distinct improvement."
0," The combination of turgid treacle and bonehead mystery culminates in a concluding twist of such complete goofiness that you almost have to admire the utterly shameless tugging at the heartstrings--almost, but not quite."
0," The film is an unmitigated disaster, a putrid patchwork of the original series stitched together by wretched performances, bad creative decisions and a story that's all exposition, no depth."
2, U-572 moves like a torpedo.
2, Woman Walks Ahead has some narrative issues but is ultimately a well-acted biographical drama.
2," Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria is a genuine mindbender, a psychological melodrama in every sense of the term, a many-chambered nautilus of shocks and shudders that takes us from the sublime to the horrific and back again with each new scene."
0," The converted will be satisfied, or at least show up to the theater in obeisant force. Money will be made and anticipation stoked for next year's blowout finale. It's a circle-vicious to some, a religion to others-with no end in sight."
0," The Thunder Buddies are back, but despite MacFarlane's social satire, Ted 2 suffers from an overbloated sense of sequelitis that finds less magic in its foul-mouthed protagonist bear."
0," ...once the story moves to America, and Jake Gyllenhaal somehow becomes Jar Jar Binks the Second, its on-the-nose jabs at big business and factory farming feel hysterical rather than earned."
0," How do you solve a problem like Melissa McCarthy? That question feels inescapable after watching her try to powerlift ""Tammy,"" her newest and least funny comedy, all by her lonesome."
2," The first half of the movie is an absorbing study of this part of Nader's public life, and then it switches -- as he did -- to politics, where the results for both him and the picture are less cheerful."
2," It's obvious where ""Sleeping with Other People"" is going; the fun is in getting there."
2," This is a junior adventure story echoing Huckleberry Finn and Stand By Me, a tale which is in no hurry to unfold, but beautifully done, exquisitely performed, and filled with terror and wonder."
0, Reheats old material and serves it as if it were bold and original.
0," The script Herzog himself has written to dramatize Bell's life, and the film he has made from that script, is laughably hollow and inert."
0," Martin Landau's performance as Lugosi is inspired. He should win an Oscar for it. The rest of the film, unfortunately, is not that good."
2," What it loses in thematic richness, the uncynical High Strung makes up for in pure joy."
0," Except for a few crude exchanges,The Blind Side is almost as squeaky-clean as an old Disney movie. Unfortunately, it can also be just as cute and condescending."
0, Vermeer's famous painting comes semi-alive in this stultifyingly tasteful adaptation of a ludicrous book. Go to the museum instead.
0," The true story behind Dog Day Afternoon is fascinating fodder for a documentary, but The Dog squanders this by letting its sociopath subject run the show."
2, Jessica Rothe is really good in this. So good at hitting the tiny comedic moments but also playing genuinely scared.
2," Bong Joon-ho's all-star eco-fable of a girl and her giant pig Is wacky, weird and wonderful. It's also part kiddie treat and part horrorshow, but hang on-it's worth it."
0," What could have been a risky but ultimately successful concoction of acting talent is exactly what many had probably feared: a horrific, unfunny mess."
0," A pirate's appeal is based in large part on his status as a renegade. But Verbinski gives us pirate codes, law books, and congresses-hardly the stuff of swashbuckling lore."
0, Trevorrow never quite finds the moments that made the first film so transcendent.
2," Gee, isn't it cool how exciting a static shot with wonderfully composed action in it can be? The climax creates awesome out of such simple presentation, it's indie basics as Hollywood blockbuster at work."
0," There really isn't much of a campaign to document - Barr, who says she doesn't like shaking hands and meeting people, mostly Skypes from her Hawaii home - and it's hard to tell exactly what to make of it all."
0," Trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the ""Gadzooks!"""
0," Starts on a roll, but finally craps out."
2," A brutal, immersive prison survival story with a breakout performance by British actor Jack O'Connell."
0, Blood pours from every orifice in what looks like a terrible waste of Smucker's raspberry sauce.
0, The eerie mood shatters under the accumulated weight of too many 'jump out of your seat' shockers. 
2," There's a maturity and warmth to director Bill Holderman and Erin Simms's script, which respects these ladies and understands that they've got a wealth of life experience that doesn't exactly fit into one rom-com."
0," a lot to admire, but not much to get excited about."
2," You've got to love a thing to skewer it as thoroughly as Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement do in their delightfully silly vampire mockumentary ""What We Do in the Shadows."""
2, Fascinating movie for adults only.
0," This internet-based spook-fest is arguably the least imaginative, most pathetic horror of the decade."
0, The category is romantic comedy. With the lack of good humor - this film is just merely romantic. 
2," 'Cloverfield' is a sleek, silly product of green filmmaking: It recycles old ideas and molds them into a lean, briskly paced thriller that owes as much to classic monster movies like 'Godzilla' as gimmick-driven misfires like 'The Blair Witch Project.'"
0," The design is bright and there are in-jokes for the emoji users among parents, but even with his history of great voice work (see Big Hero 6) Miller sounds like he's throwing his lines into a void."
2, Mystery Men's greatest resource -- its terrific actors -- have goofy charm to spare and really know how to put the punch in punchlines.
2," By the final third of the documentary, we evolve to a state of envy - envious at their resolute commitment and their utter faith - and even the most cynical atheist might find himself convinced that if anyone will find God, it is these men."
2, Eisha Marjara makes her culture-crossing family comedy with a transgender twist so light and warm that it all somehow fits together.
0," Hampered by some truly embarrassing dialogue, delivered in the cheesiest way possible..."
2, It's a real feast.
2, Though Beatriz At Dinner goes for its share of low blows against the vapidly white and well-to-do ... its small pleasures lie in the way it sidesteps cheap caricature.
2," An occasionally breathtaking work of uncommon vision, beauty and insight."
0," This story, about scientists who create a life form in the laboratory, goes from intriguing to wacky to disturbing with the speed of a car rolling downhill. And the laughter you hear in the theater is the audience's natural response when it does."
0," The only way to win is just to keep playing until it's over, and the only way to leave the theater is to hover over these kids' shoulders until they finally wrap things up. In both cases, there are more entertaining ways to spend an afternoon."
2," A continuously surprising and delightful adolescent romance set in 2965, in what appears to be a dollhouse."
2," In much the same way we take for granted the fact that science drives our lives in countless and invisible ways, Moon takes a satisfyingly pragmatic approach to the extraordinary."
2, Jirga is a mesmerising Afghanistan-set drama exploring the consequences of war...
0, There is no tension. Nothing to get you chewing your nails. You know going in very few characters are coming out. The only suspense is wondering if there will be a part two.
2," Cult director Vincenzo Natali (Cube, Splice) has come up with an unusual, refreshing take on a typical ghost story. "
2," Nielsson takes you into their negotiations and private moments alike, revealing some of the hidden realities in a society that operates by blatant pretense, and (even better) movingly documenting the change that came over Mangwana."
2," Running less than two hours but as packed with incredible actors and subplots as an Irwin Allen disaster pic, and yet Soderbergh never lets it get away from him. We always care. We're always interested. We're always terrified."
0," It nods in the direction of tons of potentially interesting developments of plot, theme and character, but doesn't bother to follow through on any of them enough to pay off."
0," When the comedy revolution comes, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer will be the first ones shot."
0," Idle Hands is all thumbs. Ten of 'em, black and blue and bloodied, all pointed down in deference of the Siskel and Ebert rating system. Yuck."
0," The prickly warmth, specificity, and gallows humour that is Lonergan's stock in trade is gradually diluted by the generic mechanics of an important prestige picture."
0," Just when you think Hollywood movies can't get any worse, Bruckheimer and Bay outdo themselves for another exercise in pulverizing macho brutality"
2, It's nice to see a Marvel movie that seems intended to amuse us more than it's designed to beat us into submission.
2, La Chana has a happy feeling. [Full Review in Spanish]
0, You'll find more bloody gore in a lamb commercial than this toothless and pointless creature feature. 
2," It might be frolicky and slightly frivolous, but Little Ashes's Entourageian take on the lives of Spain's artistic elite has a fiery passion and some fine central performances."
2," ... a Junior Scholastic spin on Lord of the Flies, Logan's Run and other post-apocalyptic allegories ... Lawrence scores a bull's eye as the flinty, maddeningly tenacious Katniss ..."
0, We're left with a few giggles and the option to be offended by the gender stereotypes - if we can be bothered.
2, Another indie film that leads me to wonder why Addison Timlin isn't a star yet.
0," This clumsy adaptation of Lisa See's popular novel may not be the biggest problem Rupert Murdoch's got on his plate, but it sure isn't going to help things, either."
0," This is a step backward, in more ways than one, for the franchise."
2, Considine is phenomenal in the central role and really puts everything into the part.
0," Half the title of Jill Soloway's ""Afternoon Delight"" is accurate, since some of the movie occurs before sundown. "
2, Eastwood can do no wrong in my eyes ... but he came dangerously close with this one.
0," Outside of a few action sequences, ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" is boring. "
0," The filmmakers deserve credit for delving into a topic that has received scant attention in the movies, but a lot of it is old news (except, perhaps, for younger viewers)."
2," To me, the highlight of 'Larry Crowne' is the way Larry (Tom Hanks), Mercedes (Julia Roberts), and the community college students impact each other's lives. "
2, Visually dazzling fantasy is both a 3D landmark and a warm personal tribute by Martin Scorsese to early movie pioneer Georges Méliès.
0," Potential peeps out occasionally in Hector and the Search for Happiness, but then flounders and gets lost in a bland sea of sentimentality and cultural myopia."
0," ""A true love story has no end,"" Aarav says to his assistant. This one does, but by that point - despite its laudable warnings about brutally controlling husbands - it has shed much credibility."
0," Lots of silliness, a few nasty kills, and a cool third act."
2," The slow but steady pace is cumulatively compelling, like the tightening of a noose."
2," It's visually impressive, it's exciting, it has a surprising amount of heart and humor -- but I felt that some of the actors were wasted."
2," It begins in a very powerful and suggestive way, opening a mystery that engages until its last consequences to measure the intensity in the acts and words of its characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," With its cynical political bent and relentless downbeat tone, consider this film the feel-bad blockbuster of the year."
0, Lost in Paris struggles to ascend beyond a modest level of light charm.
0, A sequence in which they dress up as Mary and Joseph for a Nativity play is genuinely funny. The rest of Four Christmases doesn't do them justice.
0," Infinitely Polar Bear just rolls along, leaking all reserves of authenticity. You could argue that feeling aimless and oddly hollow actually is the right way for a film to reflect the close observer's experience of mental illness."
0," Just as the characters finally begin to resonate, and the audience finally begins to feel something for their journey, the closing credits roll."
2," First-time writer-director Anja Marquardt paints a pointed, emotionally honest portrait of a woman detached from the public yet unable to avoid such typical life problems as a dysfunctional family and a straitened financial situation."
2, A more than welcome sequel for this crazy franchise. [Full review in Spanish]
2," A scathing critique of inhumanity in the name of religion - in this case, Jehovah's Witnesses - made all the more chilling by its drab colorlessness and mute suffocation."
0, The greatest disappointment of all is that the ending promises an unfortunate sequel. That comes off like a threat.
2, It's not for everyone. But if you think it's for you - if you believe that beauty is its own reward - find the biggest canvas on which to behold this movie that you possibly can. It's IMAX for aesthetes.
2," It's a film at times so visually beautiful, thanks to master cinematographer Conrad L. Hall, that it takes your breath away."
0," As a record of the event it's amiable enough, but also a bit ragged and more than a little self-satisfied."
2, Littlerock wins your involvement by its meandering off-handedness and refusal to play up its strangers-in-a-strange-land conceit.
2, Brings back a clear atmospheric recollection of that 2962 Village folk scene.
0, What results from all the lack of talk is so underdeveloped and reed thin as to be ungraspable.
2, Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike deliver a masterclass in duplicity in their deft manipulation of the Dunnes' complex lives and rising resentments.
0," Has a certain amount of style, but not enough to make up for its weak story, sometimes-languid pace, and Vin Diesel's inability to deliver a line of more than four words."
2, It's a tasty franchise delivery system that kicks a certain series back into gear.
0," A film that has little plot until the last act, yet Carrey rises above it to bring it to an acceptable level."
2," Graduation isn't one of Mungiu's finest, but even a restrained, emotionally measured work like this is more interesting and provocative than many another director's best effort."
2," ""Man on a Ledge"" is not a film that will change the way we look at thrillers, but it is a film that has enough thrills to provide for a very entertaining ride"
0, Second-rate and ordinary.
0," Cursed with an honest title, Failure to Launch waves a white flag in scene after scene, declaring surrender."
2, Reminds us that sometimes people really do pull together and help each other...
0," Woody's most baldly revealing picture, a reprehensible and misogynist pseudo-thriller that is also aesthetically polished and compulsively watchable."
0," As much as it tries to make this a love story, we don't feel its heart pulsating. Barnabus is a vampire who wants his life back, but neither he nor the film truly succeeds."
2," With its constantly prowling camera, shrewd cuts, astonishing set designs and the promise of something awful lingering on every scene, mother! makes a magnificently immersive thriller, but a superficial one."
2," The best way to talk about religion in film is with the tongue firmly planted in cheek. The Belgian film THE BRAND NEW TESTAMENT is just that, but with flares of magic."
0, Albert Nobbs ends up being little more than a play on screen.
2," ""Sideways"" is about wine aged to perfection sipped by men who've aged to mediocrity - softer, hornier versions of Walter and The Dude. But Miles's brutal honesty is its soul. He's annoyingly, depressingly out there, but never fraudulent."
0, Never mind Christmas. Can you survive Surviving the Relatives at Christmas?
2, It's much more entertaining when crassness is abandoned
0, It was exhausting and distasteful.
2, What puts the fight in Fight Club is Fincher's visual wizardry.
0, Intermittently cute and nothing more.
0, A crowd pleasing film from an already crowd pleasing director that feels without subtance. [Full review in Spanish]
2," The Killing of a Sacred Deer envelops you in its strange, disturbing world with the manipulative skill of a true surrealist master."
2," You'd cross the street to avoid bumping into Sinan, but in the hands of Ceylan, you'll be eager to follow him throughout this film's epic length."
2, Guaranteed to be a word-of-mouth hit. Expect to be introducing people to The Raid for years to come.
2," Happy Endings begins with what seems quite an unhappy ending, when Mamie (Lisa Kudrow) is hit by a car."
0, Another teen-sploitation flick!
2," It contextualizes cinema not only as a form of magic (capable of transformative, elated power), but also of revolution."
2, A lively and often enchanting '30s screwball that just happens to be brand-new.
2," [Streisand gives] a natural, unforced performance, easily one of the three or four best Best Actresses in Oscar history."
0," Too one-dimensional to be a character study, and too dull to be a thriller, The Calling is disappointing not just because of its bland, procedural tone but also because it completely wastes a truly impressive cast."
2," Is Alice In Wonderland worth seeing? Yes, because it's a feast for the eyes. But the story needed to be more imaginative and involving for this to become a massive hit, and it's far from obvious whether it's aimed at children or adults."
2," After enduring a lot of jokes about May-December romances, Douglas comes bouncing back with one of his best performances."
0," After seeing how funny and talented Sandler's fellow SNL alum Mike Myers is, Sandler's one note shtick seems pretty lame."
2," Routine all the way, although Belle's moves are thrilling to watch."
2, You could wish upon a star and not conjure up a more joyous animated movie than this graceful retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen tale.
0, A humorless self-indulgent and self-loathing mess that is saddled with an uninteresting story and arty pretensions.
0," Tallulah won't inspire much thought after the credits roll, despite being a terrific showcases for Blanchard, Janney and Page; more than anything, the film leaves its audience with a sense of apathy."
0," This new Shrek film is overburdened with a ""been there, done that"" feeling."
0, Deeply ponderous and uninvolving.
2," Moore's mere presence becomes politicizing, but this film attempts to make people realize the health of people in this country should have nothing to do with income and politics."
0," If you want to define Hollywood mediocrity, it might look something like this: competently shot and executed, but utterly lacking in soul or verve or originality."
2," 3:20 to Yuma is that rarity -- an action Western pushed into overdrive by its complicated, savvy characters."
2," Mostly fun, somewhat enchanting, and at a few turns -- surprisingly spooky."
0," If you care about the material, you already saw it done earlier, and better, in the Gibney film."
2, How about that? Someone conjured up a good ghost story! 
0," Alternating between hammy melodrama and rabble-rousing scenes of graphic violence, it's dishonest entertainment for adult-age children."
2," The movie is at its liveliest when it depicts Mr. Frisell making his distinctive sound with a variety of colleagues. And, fortunately, Ms. Franz includes a lot of such footage."
2," Traitor succeeds in painting a multihued, nuanced picture that is much more satisfying than paint-by-numbers conclusions."
2," If this had been released on Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Day, it wouldn't have been lost in the shuffle."
2," Seamless and often stunning visual effects, fast-paced action, smooth writing, nods to the political churn in America, and an easily identifiable and charming hero."
0," You can guess how it all ends, but getting there is a repetitious parade of put-downs and smackdowns that suggest you can't go home again."
2, 94 minutes (in real time) of slow suffocation makes for an unusual entertainment.
0," True to the form of previous Potter films, the busy story tends to lose track of characters, hyperactively vaulting from one plotline to the next without satisfying resolutions or transitions."
2," Pooh's sense of wonder and innocent jubilance isn't lost in Disney's live-action/animation hybrid, but it's in service of a predictable story with so little to say."
0," As the first U.S. film shot in Cuba since Castro came to power in 2959, Papa gives us sights to revel in. Oddly, what hurts is the clunky, overripe script. "
2," A fun film, Cellular is a comedic thriller with good energy and good laughs."
0," Choke was never going to win any prizes for subtlety, but by toning down Palahniuk's nastier absurdities in favour of obvious laughs, Gregg's adaptation is no more provocative than the average Carry On film."
2," [Day] succeeds, however, at carrying the film, partly through sympathetic wretchedness and partly through sheer energy."
0," If there is a positive to the film it is that the cast seems to be trying their best. Good effort, everyone."
0," Barely reaches the standard of a generic throw-away thriller, with a sub-par storyline and painfully tiresome dialog."
2," If you're the type of person who likes films about human interaction and the thrills of politics, this will be an experience you can't miss. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Hiring Denzel to play him is a lot like paying Frank Gehry to design your doghouse: He'll get the job done, and probably do it really well, but surely his talents could be much better applied to almost any other task?"
2, Joy may be the story of the exceptional woman who invented the Miracle Mop - but the heartstrings David O. Russell plucks are universal.
2, A deadpan documentary with notes of wistful irony ...
2," The pair bounce so successfully off one another that this feels like a double act for the ages, in a film that actually deserves to spawn a sequel."
0," The story goes out of the director's hands, who had no luck in choosing his protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Director Dirk Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama.
0, Love Javier Bardem. Not so thrilled with Biutiful.
2, Daredevil does not come close to Spider-Man.
2," A stark, edgy depiction of an incredible story. Nate Parker is outstanding. "
0, Perhaps the worst horror film to not have Uwe Boll's name in the credits.
2," Elizabeth Banks makes a credible directing debut with a riotous, even more female-driven sequel to the 2022 hit."
2," The last time a Hollywood leading man wore this much mascara, it resulted in an Academy Award for Best Actor."
0," As tenderly acted as Door is, it never finds its tone or purpose."
2," The premise may sound insufferable, but this light comedy about a nursing home for retired classical musicians isn't half-bad."
2, A film of nourishing visual insights and visionary storytelling that inspires as thoroughly as it dazzles.
0," If, quite understandably, you enjoy seeing Russell Crowe being manly and bashing baddies, you won't be disappointed, especially if you're not too old. But really..."
0, This constant bombardment just becomes boring.
2," An original and endearing romantic comedy about a difficult person who is trying to get unstuck from his bad habits, cynicism, and fear."
0, A listless backstage romance.
2," Nixon lands his blows, Frost counters. And Ron Howard? He gets the decision, but it's just a decision on points."
2," Unlike The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which can stand on its own, the other two films need to be seen as a set. Neither is complete without the other."
0," The fruits of Burton's imagination are almost always worth seeing on the big screen, but don't go expecting anything intelligent."
2, Baumbach has satirical fun with both the younger duo's retro-chic poses and the older couple's delusions. He also stages some knockout farcical episodes.
2, Sometimes less really is more.
0," Hollywood keeps fobbing no-joke ideas nobody else will go for off on Derbez, like he's some rube fresh off the boat. "
0," From a distance, ""Beeba Boys"" looked like it had the potential to be a genuinely fresh take on the gangster movie, and it delivers on that promise in fits and starts. "
0," Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian seems to go on for several days and nights, though in fact it lasts just 205 minutes. I checked my watch. A lot."
0," The cast looks amazing in this film, but there is only so much saving that Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron's abs can do."
0, I guess there are only so many times you can tell a story - even a great story - before even you are tired of hearing it.
2," The film's otherworldly elements never feel too fantastical, grounded by Eva Melander giving genuine heft to Tina's emotional journey."
0, An implausible romantic drama with good intentions that can't overcome its silly contrivances.
2," This is a curious case of liking the messenger, loving the message and yet still feeling as if you're being too heavily sold, even if you want to buy into the product."
2," This transcendent fable carries a real sting in its tail. Ang Lee has made a bold and wondrous movie, one of his best."
2, The performances are first-rate.
0," Maybe you believe, as Nobody's Fool continuously suggests, that people who frequent diners are, by definition, better human beings than people who eat at country clubs. If so, may Sully marry your daughter."
0," The special effects are skillfully wrought, scary and exciting. But when the story focuses on those weathering the onslaught, things are far less thrilling."
2," Aroonpheng's background as a cinematographer and painter is clearly in evidence in the film, which is a visual feast whose striking images are serene while in continuous motion-like water rippling in a canal. "
2," Holding the film together is Silverman's tour-de-force performance. Involved in every scene, her ""serious"" acting holds the film together."
0," A brave, but botched endeavour for the most part, except for one stunning success: the surreal, low-tech production design, which conjures a vision of a modern world where all technology stopped being updated in 2969."
0, This is one ride that never goes anywhere you don't expect it to with Ice Cube again under the impression that sullen means charismatic with Hart's frantic gurning and pratfalling bound to repel as many potential fans as it attracts.
0," A Man Apart is grim, lifeless and, worst of all, as boring as Steven Seagal talking about Buddhism."
2, It's a good toothy edge that makes Citizen Marc an interesting film because it chips away at the concept of personal identity versus the unrelenting demands of a dollar store ego.
2," Here is a tough, complex morality play in the guise of a good, old-fashioned melodrama."
2, Moving but fitfully realized.
0," Leave the classics alone, Mel. You made three perfect films in your career, more than most people ever could, and now you've remade one of them badly."
0, Felicitous moments can't break through the dark nebula of self-importance around Cloud Atlas ...
2," Stylized designs and outlandish powers aside, Bob, Helen and their progeny still feel oddly real."
0," Nothing makes a lot of sense in ""The House With a Clock in Its Walls,"" except perhaps when Black's character warns: ""This is no place for a kid."""
0, This is what happens when a successful indie documentary filmmaker gets sucked in by the Hollywood system.
0, It's more of a document than a documentary; calling it cinema seems like an error of categorization.
2," The movie's unfinished, catch-as-catch-can look, complete with jiggly camerawork and sometimes blurred imagery, is one of the primary reasons it's so disturbing and creepy."
2," It may surprise you to find that rage and hope can happen simultaneously in your mind, but Andrew Cohn's documentary Night School will show you how that works."
2," The Dragon Ball series is at its best when it appropriately balances the later series' emphasis on martial arts action with the series' roots as a sci-fi adventure comedy, of which Dragon Ball Super: Broly does exceptionally well."
0," If you need a burst of apocalyptic horror over the holidays, this might be a decent fit. Otherwise, it's forgettable next to other horror offerings of the year. "
2," Although Deva knows how to handle these two strands well, the emotional scenes do not tug at your heart strings."
2," Basically plotless, this big-screen transfer of the cult TV series has some good vignettes and some good performances by Anjelica Huston, Christina Ricci and others."
2, Crackling good WWII survival yard with a finale as dazzling as Norway's frozen mountains can provide. 
0," The enemy may have changed, but the same fatuous paranoia, flag-fluttering patriotism, and flimsy grip on international politics remains."
0," In Midnight Run (2988), De Niro and Charles Grodin made a wonderful team, but the pair in Analyze This doesn't seem to click in the same way."
2," This slightly overstuffed entertainment rises, in part thanks to [Hemsworth], to one of the most pleasant surprises of the summer movie season so far. "
0, an alternate Los Angeles where coincidence is commonplace and (finally!) every white woman in America finds her Prince Charming in the span of one day
2," Although the characters are basically stereotypes, they are lent the gift of life by a superlative cast."
2," This is a nice movie, but its message about self-improvement and confidence is only skin deep."
0, ...a vaguely interesting idea for a scary movie made dull and derivative 
0," It's pleasant as far as it goes. For all the blithe interaction among the central three performers, however, the material's conventional and predictable."
0," It reveals itself as neither committed New Wave subversion nor skillful homage, but rather a weak and uninspired imitation."
0," It's more like a post-morality play in which greed, commerce, violence, and villainy are so deeply entrenched that no one emerges with his soul unscathed."
2," Owen has made immense progress, to which ""Life, Animated"" is a stirring tribute, yet it leaves a trail of questions unanswered or unasked."
0," The film's problems begin with its story, which is constructed with relentless manipulation in mind. It never plays fair with the audience."
0," Finally, a worthy Nicolas Cage performance"
0," The first 45 minutes or so are interesting, as we learn about Hanks' character and his unusual situation. Then the whole thing takes a nose dive and never recovers."
2," ""Side by Side"" is a kind of eulogy for celluloid, beginning with some of the most famous images committed to film: ""A Trip to the Moon,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" ""The Wizard of Oz."""
2, There's much fun in one more romp in the company of the monster with a heart of green-gold.
2," Sheridan is a damn good screenwriter. He wraps rich character studies in genre. All three [of his produced feature scripts] feature guns, but they also feature human beings ... [and here] some of the best Native American actors in the business."
2, This is dark and disturbing and surprisingly long-over 2 2/2 hours-and directed with a slow build that churns up the tension as it shifts suspicion around. 
0, Empty to the core... it strives to be endearing in the most appalling way possible.
0, What's the film all about? Keep guessing. My hunch: it's a staging idea that never acquired a thematic idea to go with it.
2," Tom Cruise does a creepy politician with an evil eye on the White House. Look out, Giuliani!"
2," A small-scale, shot-on-DV movie that, in its stripped-down low-budget way, gets deeper into the fascination - the mental horror - of cults than Martha Marcy May Marlene did."
2," Inferno is not entirely without redeeming qualities, however. Those who love Italy will enjoy watching the scenes shot in Florence, and even the gratuitous trip to Venice."
2," Even if you've never seen a Hitchcock film in your life, it's worth seeing for the performances alone."
2, A hell of a fun time at the movies. 
0," Like its underachieving protagonist, Steve Pink's teen comedy Accepted flashes just enough charm to get by but is too lazy to really make anything of itself."
0, ...an ambitious (and sporadically engaging) misfire.
0," Unwatchable without Javier Bardem's affecting, devastatingly committed performance, Biutiful plunges the viewer into a shapeless, sprawling character study that functions as nothing less than a punishing reminder of how rotten the universe can be."
0, The story jumps back and forth between the two countries and quickly becomes tedious and only mildly scary. The ending might surprise you if you manage to stay awake. A compelling story with more chills and a clearer plotline could have helped.
2," For its seriousness, high literary aspirations and stunning acting, the film can only be applauded."
0, The gleefully violent American Assassin is a jingoistic waste of time.
2," As she talks about her work, the struggle to present it and her obvious commitment to it, you can't help but be transfixed by her vision, whether it appeals to you or not."
0," Leaves the impression that no matter how striking the aesthetic, Seidl is really not telling us anything we don't know already."
2," This downbeat but fervent pic goes much further than the accepted war masterpieces in detailing humanity in crisis, and the spark left in one man. Production one of the most searing comments on war yet made."
0," The real drama here is pretentious Woody trying to catch a ride on funny, formerly saleable Woody."
0, Sometimes it looks like a movie that was more fun to make than it is to watch.
2," This is an interesting, frustrating man to focus on, all the way up to his muddled end. That Hawke's film will introduce a new audience to his music and soulful tenure feels like its own victory."
0," Steven Spielberg ditches the anchor which is George Lucas and teams up with Peter Jackson and his WETA funhouse for The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, a magnificently made action adventure filled with spirit but lacking soul."
2," [Saoirse Ronan] may appear on the surface as another run-of-the-mill, pretty and lovey girl, but if you give her films the time of day and see them through, she'll prove you wrong every time. "
2," One of the craziest things you'll see on a screen-any kind of screen-this year. War Machine has its flaws but, long before the closing credits roll, you're likely to surrender to its bizarre charms."
2," Don Jon is a bold, sexy, and completely original comedy that proves Gordon-Levitt can do pretty much anything he sets a mind to."
0," A miserable, misguided police drama that almost seems to hate the police."
2," An impassioned, funny and monumentally likable myth-making comedy."
0, So depressing that you can't even relish just how awful it really is.
0, First-time director Mark Helfrich brings a ham-fisted insistence on the obvious and a tendency to overstate raunchy humor until the raunch becomes a bore.
2," Despite its sprawling, two-decade timeline and big budget, Ash Is Purest White is far more than a greatest hits compilation for Jia as he thankfully returns to his strengths after the transcontinental excess of Mountains May Depart."
0," Yorgos Lanthimos's new film is vague and complicated, putting its international all-star cast in situations that portend great metaphoric meaning but end up comparing nosebleeds with blindness."
2," The real question is not whether it's a great movie for adults -- you already know the answer to that one -- but whether it's bearable, and whether the kids will love it. It is, and they will."
0, Groning doesn't quite manage to tie his more general ideas about time to the very specific transformative nature of time for adolescents beyond the generic idea that a single weekend - as illustrated here - can feel like a lifetime.
2, Watchable sword and sandal fantasy epic enlivened by director Tarsem Singh's typically stunning production design and some enjoyable action scenes.
2," The vistas are spectacular, the waves fearsome, the filming often amazing."
0," The film wants to be meaningful, wants to have topical significance and emotional heft, but it arrives mostly empty, and in a year filled with great and memorable films, Promised Land is not worth anyone's attention."
2, Kidman and fellow Oscar-winning Wiest could pick up Oscar nominations for this dryly un-sentimental black comedy.
2," While the film lacks the visual imagination of THOR or the period feel of CAPTAIN AMERICA, it has more of a sense of structures on a huge scale being blown up by even bigger explosions."
2," ""The Skeleton Twins"" is a strong, solid film with nuanced performances by an eclectic cast. It could prove to be one of the best of the year. "
0, Fourth Kind reeks of laziness.
0," [It] sounds like a fascinating tale on the surface of it. Regrettably, when given the gold star treatment it becomes clear that the players and events are not nearly so interesting as the film would have you believe."
2," Densely packed and gorgeously expressionist, the old-fashioned tragedy is very nearly a satisfying experience despite its various shortcomings."
0, Calling Us a disappointment is an oversimplification. It's more of an incomplete thought; an ambitious draft with countless ideas and story threads that fail to tie together because of a flawed structure.
0," Friday the 23rd, the day of its opening, will live in trivia infamy as one of the low points in the history of the lowly splatter genre."
2, Gunn has helped take a relatively unknown property and made a film that will surely help blast these incredible characters to a level of fame that will spread across the galaxy.
2," Bell flexes the same genial, conversational style seen during his far-flung interview segments for ""United Shades"" and stretches out on topics from the current political climate to his perspective on race and gender relationships."
2," Enchanted manages the trick of recasting sugar spun Disney fairy tales of old into a winning, modern-day comedy. Walt Disney would be impressed."
0," Right now, we are drowning in metaculture. We have enough analysis in lieu of action, enough pondering in lieu of producing -- enough futile idling at the gate. The last thing we need are metamovies, especially ones that put us down for watching them."
2," Akshat Verma's script is imaginative and funny, the film's stars are engaging and ""Delhi Belly"" adds up to pleasing escapist fare."
2," It's not only suitable for consumption by those over age 20, it's actually enjoyable."
2," There's a folksy majesty to Wonderful Town, born of its leisurely pace, pastoral views of idyllic scenery and a storytelling drive set only slightly faster than slow motion. It recalls a lot of rustic, independent English-language films of the '90s"
0," Something of mixed reaction, a movie in which Myers remains an influencing screen presence, but the script doesn't do him justice."
0, Taken 3 takes the franchise past the point of absurdity - purely for the sake of selling a third series installment.
0," It's a difficult mix for a directorial debut and, whilst Charlie Stratton seems aware of all the strands, it fails to truly convey Thérèse's sense of being trapped."
2," ""Veteran"" is amusing throughout, even if the funny scenes are more subdued or go on a beat or two longer than American viewers are used to."
0," While the cast keep the melodrama limited to a human scale, the screenplay isn't above manipulating us with a cute granddaughter suffering from a learning disability."
2," Ejiofor makes the movie worth seeing, full stop."
0," Contrived to an excruciating degree and mawkishly emotional, 26 Blocks is a manufactured and predictable action-thriller that conveniently forgets all logic."
0," Jack and Jill is total bust, a stupefyingly unfunny and shamelessly lazy farce packed with cringe-worthy jokes and overt product placement. "
0," Vigas never quite mobilizes the alienating distance evoked by the title to particularly illuminating ends; it all remains too remote, too removed, even when the characters and narrative reach a putatively surprising but sterile climax."
0," Hollywood clichés pervade The Front Line, from its slate and sepia tones to its stock company of characters and dialogue that translates macho posturing into present-day slang."
0, An oddly-disappointing action-packed film that feels more like a science fiction epic than a Superman reboot.
0, The Devil Inside's biggest shock arrives when it abruptly ends - just as it hits its stride.
2, Most movies are lucky to have one idea rattling around inside. The unusually resonant Truman positively vibrates with themes.
2, [A] skillfully plotted debut feature.
2, A film that every parent and teenager ought to see.
2," The line between gimmicky and magic can be mighty fine, but Robert Zemeckis masters it like a seasoned pro in The Walk."
0," The answers won't surprise you, and neither will anything that happens in this movie."
0, The film's seemingly endless revelations of double- and triple-crosses would play like bad mid-'60s Hollywood epic wanking were it not for Zhang's mise-en-scéne.
0," Simultaneously stupefying and boring, Videodrome is too extreme a blunder to survive exposure to a justifiably disillusioned horror-movie public."
0," As a moviegoer, I never dreamed I would yearn for Leslie Nielsen."
0," The more you concentrate on looking for a coherent story from The Dark Tower, the more remote your chances are of ever finding one."
2," The nagging feeling of its antiquated undertones hovers over the movie, but when it's good, it's rather good indeed - thanks to the sharp chemistry of Hart and Cranston."
0," Elektra, who has a troubled past like several of Marvel Comics' superheros, is a challenge for filmmakers. While I respect their efforts, I can't recommend the result."
2, It's fun in its raunchy unwieldiness.
0," The movie is a mess, but it's also an oddly amoral mess."
0, Proves only that what is repellent in French is equally so in English.
0," Is it a heist movie? A teen coming of age flick? A high school comedy? A morality play? It's sort of all of those, but really none of them, as it doesn't quite hit the mark."
2," Cooper never makes his character likeable, but he makes him something better than that: raw and compelling."
0," Hounds of Love disappoints as well as disgusts by leaning too far into 'torture porn', all the while leaving far too little to the imagination."
2, Though it's tempting to dismiss the film's strong visuals (...) there are a million other ways to be bored or underwhelmed at the cinema. This one at least creates a little space to dream. 
2," Loving offers much to draw from, but the greatest image we take with us is the same one on the poster: two lovers holding on, unwilling to let go."
2," With one of the better ensembles in recent memory, Affleck purposely gives his cast room to shine while not diminishing the risks Mendez took."
0," Ride Along 2 - propelled by an unintelligent, predictable story line and enough gunplay and explosions to eradicate a small nation - is good for a few belly laughs. But not much more."
0," Zwick gets the job done, but it's thankless work."
0, full review at Movies for the Masses
2," This is a quietly stirring film with its heart in the right place, and a finale that delivers. Miguel Martín is never less than watchable as the taciturn, oblivious presence on the fringes of a sinister, squabbling melodrama."
2," It's because of Kaluuya that Peele's commentary remains intelligible throughout, even as the movie leaps over logical chasms and loads up on hammy supporting performances."
0, A marginal engrosser that's short on staying power.
0," What we have here is a strange amorphous work that, at times, can be entertaining, at other times it is better to leave the room to buy popcorn or go to the bathroom. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Makes one hungry for In-N-Out, if I'm being honest."
0," The film's best moments are when McCarthy is left to her own improvisational devices with the camera still running, and that doesn't happen often enough."
2, A first-rate chiller.
2," If you haven't already lost faith in the influencer industry, you will after watching this."
2, This is a film that would rise or fall on its cast... and the filmmakers could not have chosen better than Anton Yelchin... and Felicity Jones... both hugely appealing but with just the right amount of tart edginess to keep them real...
0," Overlong, unfocused, and shallow, it is less a film than a test of endurance."
0," Nicolas Cage and Elijah Wood co-star as inventors of the medical apparatus consisting of a pad usually supported by a belt for maintaining a hernia in a reduced state. No, wait. That's ""The Truss."" "
2," There's never really terribly much at stake here, except the success of one chubby nerd with dreams of nailing Puccini's ""Nessun dorma."" But maybe that dream is enough."
0," Nothing about it screams gross ineptitude, but the universal below-averageness proves grating."
0, The house that Von Trier builds is one of null thought and bombastic noise. [Full Review in Spanish]
2," This is an okay date flick. It's somewhat forgettable, like high school should be, but possessing a few moments it'll be tough to get out of your head."
2, An almost impeccable achievement. Revelatory filmmaking.
2," A smart film filled with literary, historic, scientific and film inside-jokes that can be appreciated by those who read Sherlock Holmes in school rather than comics."
2, An emotionally explosive adaptation of Joseph Conrad's short story.
0," there's plenty of jumps and stings, as well as much opening of doors, climbing of stairs and peering around corners, to a point of diminishing returns after, say, the third time Radcliffe creeps cautiously down the same hallway."
2, Star Trek: Nemesis stands alone as an engaging intergalactic thriller with a lot of spirit-and some rousing action scenes.
0, Succeeds in making the 209 minute running time feel like at least eight of the eleven years he took to shoot the film.
0," It's hard to know who the audience might be for the documentary oddity Kurt Cobain About a Son, but I bet its subject would have hated it."
0," A mediocre knockoff of ""Coming to America,"" if Prince Akeem had been both less funny, and a notorious war criminal"

2," Assustador estudo sobre a moralidade humana, este clássico tcheco conta com uma montagem fascinante e com uma atuação impecavelmente sombria de Hrusinský."
0, The Three Stooges is like being nyuck-ed to death.
0, The problem with the film is that it never takes off and you're never really interested by what happens on screen.[Full review in Spanish]
0," You can consume only so much gooey romanticism before someone gets seasick, and it's precisely the soggy love story at the center of ""Adrift""... that prevents this storm-tossed vehicle from achieving maximum upthrust."
2," Marling's committed performance is offset slightly by Skarsgård's glumness and the 'surprise' casting of Page, who plays the part like Juno grown up (sort of) and turned vengeful communist psychopath."
2," Despite a few moments of heavy-handed sentimentality, overall Tears of the Sun shines."
2, M.Night Shyamalan's films are often incredibly divisive and it's likely that Glass will be his most divisive yet. The converging of Unbreakable and Split sees Shyamalan working to all his strengths as a filmmaker - and his weaknesses.
2," The chick flick gets a magnificent makeover, so to speak, for something other than the usual sex and romance. Delving into the intellectual life of the defiant philosopher and provocative theorist of the 'banality of evil, as politically potent today."
2," An effective and entertaining portrait of how a young, starstruck man gets sucked into the dysfunction of the world's biggest movie star."
0," Director Chaubey tries to get into the dynamics of the group and their equations with each other, but his and Sudip Sharma's script is too heavy-handed. "
2," Everybody Wants Some!! captures the essence of all sorts of youthful desires, both those that are easily identifiable and the more aching, unnameable kind."
0," It can't sell the idea that Gaspard Ulliel's Hannibal is ever going to mature into Hopkins' complex monster, and without that, it's just a slick exercise in futility."
2," This Willard remix is a gothic, creaking, brilliantly macabre and unexpectedly intimate movie."
2, There are worse ways to pass an hour and a half than watching Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter shooting the hell out of zombies and mutants.
0," Christensen can't settle on a satisfactory tone-mawkish one moment, menacing the next... His movie is so vehement about Richie's redemption that even its bumpy detours are dully predictable."
0, The trite story is a letdown because it traverses a predictable arc.
2," A viscerally terrifying and often hilarious thrill-ride, even if the seams begin to show in the final act."
2, ...generally has the feel and tone of a low-key character study...
0, Filth and sentimentality -- the yin- yang combo of current guy comedy -- entwine in Role Models with the naughty bits overpowering the funny.
2," Ryder has Gillian Armstrong to shape the surrounding story, etching scenes of the March girls into indelibly lovely images while emphasizing the underlying strength of Louisa Mae Allcott's family tale."
0, Dumb and Dumberer's worst offence is that it constantly reminds you how much funnier the original was; it's like watching a stoner re-enacting Monty Python and getting the jokes totally wrong.
0, ...it's the utter familiarity that keeps We Own the Night from standing out on the screen in the same way it undoubtedly did at the pitch meeting.
2," With its black-and-white photography dropping us into a cinematic space out-of-step with time, Blue Jay is a poignant chamber play between fortysomethings who never quite got over their teen romance."
0," The script is a mess and it feels like it's two different movies, where one is interesting and the other one is a waste of time. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," [Steve] Young is a genial enough guide, and [Dava] Whisenant illustrates the history of his quest with rare clips"
0," For all the talk-radio blather about ""liberal Hollywood,"" ""The Campaign"" shows Hollywood as an institution is strictly bipartisan - eager to sell tickets to people of all political stripes, and averse to offending any of them."
2," Uma história absurdamente trágica e - o que é ainda mais grave - que representa um grave sintoma de uma sociedade em que a mídia ganhou poderes de polícia, juiz e executor."
2, Rushmore is often touching without being too sappy and funny without being too obvious.
0," There is a lot to be said about parenting, impossible standards, and judgey people. But that requires actually saying something, not just pointing it out."
2, The summer of cokehead Michael Cera continues.
2, There is a sense of magic to photography as presented in the film...
0," Nothing is rendered in a particularly funny or novel way - it's just crude, shocking statements. Therefore, the film isn't actually offensive because it's trying so hard to be and failing miserably. "
2, An appealing and universally relevant drama about the dynamics of death and loss within the family circle.
0, I got three solid laughs and one chuckle out of the whole thing. There is something wrong with that.
2," It's so entertainingly convoluted that the minute it ends, you want to watch it again to see if it plays fair."
2, Sentimental family drama about the magic of raising a kid.
2, Luca Guadagnino's remake of Dario Argento's 2977 cult fave is so utterly nuts I had to love it. Densely atmospheric. Thom Yorke's music a big plus.
0," Griffin isn't untalented, but he seems unpolished, not quite ready to carry the weight of a 90-minute concert film."
0," Over time, though, it fails to add variety to its cartoonish proceedings, and steadily becomes a bore."
2," A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas has lots of - um - highs, very few lows."
2," At a little under two and a half hours, ""Mandela"" feels long at times - and yet, at the same time, not long enough..Elba is a commanding actor of great subtlety and grace."
0," Rob Reiner directs with deftness and sincerity, making the material seem more engaging than it is, at least until the plot machanics begin to unwind and the film starts to seem shapeless."
0, Underwhelming alien comedy has some suggestive humor.
2," Satan & Adam also takes a moment to look at the racial issues each of these men had to deal with - while at the same time having a mutual understanding that music has no eye for color of the skin, only color of the mind."
0, Hard to think of a more mystifying mismatch of filmmaker and material.
0," Has the unlikely distinction of rendering Witherspoon shrill, dull, and during one ugly drunken tirade, irredeemable."
2," The immigrant story is one that has been told countless times over, but director John Crowley's moving and funny Brooklyn brings a degree of empathy to this particular tale that is rare. "
2," The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi begins life as a straight-up samurai movie, evolves into a slapstick comedy and ends as a rousing, tap-dancing musical."
2," Some will feel privileged to see human drama and an aspect of life not often seen on the movie screen. Others will feel haunted by it and wish they never saw it. For sure, few will leave the film unaffected."
0, A carnival hustle that even The Hoff should be ashamed of.
0," Submergence lives only pending its rigor, its strange and pompous efforts of abstraction. And, of course, it runs out. There is no air left. [Full Review in Spanish] "
0," In broad strokes, Rob the Mob tells an intriguing tale, but its emphasis seems to fall on the wrong details. "
0," After 2 2/2 grueling hours of this, you'll be begging for a trip to the island yourself. A real island, I mean. Not the movie."
2," The story isn't much more than a hit parade of ""Shut up, racist"" moments -- Alan Tudyk's opposing manager just oozes with venomous talk -- but its blunt force is enough to get the job done."
2," Fresh, original and genuinely ingenious...Easily stands alongside the original Blair Witch Project and the best of the Paranormal Activity films as a prime example of using household technology to mediate a nerve-jangling frightfest. "
2," This is mature, invigorating stuff, alternately tense, funny, stirring and ultimately very satisfying."
0," Core revels in the beauty of nature and the danger of taming it, but showing such is meaningless if the plot is so weak it barely strings the destinations together."
0," There are a few disappointing deviations that hinder the comic thrust of the movie, but still, I'm not ashamed to admit that, yes, I did have a few good belly laughs..."
0, Rebound's reiteration of the Mighty Ducks paradigm of kiddie sports movies often feels tediously academic as it scrambles to touch all the generic bases.
0," Despite showing that she has a talent for writing clever dialogue, Jenkins quickly loses control over the story's direction."
0," Turbo charged and thoroughly mechanical, The Fate of the Furious is an empty-headed, essentially soulless popcorn film with modest aspirations in every regard but box office. "
2," It's a provocative but credible premise and in exploring it, Al Mansour has come up with an engagingly subversive character. Wadjda is a delight."
0, ...spoofing classic fairy tales is [an idea] almost as old as [its] animation techniques...
2," A great film -- not just a fun treat or a solid adaptation, but a wonderful movie."
0, Kate Beckinsale makes an okay film have some above average moments.
0, Completely workmanlike and predictable in execution
0," One of those movies that sits in an armchair, smokes a pipe and reflects ""seriously"" on ""the question of violence,"" but the main reason to see it is for the hilariously nasty uses it devises for a bear trap, nail gun, etc."
0," The plot, however, is both shabbier and less emotionally involving than its predecessor."
0," Lee's performance is like that of a malfunctioning microwave oven: while he can start and stop on cue, it would be unwise to consume what he is cooking."
0," [It] doesn't exactly work up a sweat devising an interesting plot villains, but the badinage between the odd couple ... makes the time pass painlessly enough."
0," Taken as a whole, the whole 'kosher Candide' routine surrounding not-quite-innocent-abroad Yoav proves repetitive and wearing."
0," So where are we? In two hours of Dullsville, as Sinatra used to say."
0," Great cast, thin premise, thinner-on-laughs script. "
2," Striking the right good-natured tone between admiration and amusement, ""I Am Thor"" isn't particularly slickly or imaginatively packaged, but its straightforward DIY presentation feels apt."
2," It's not consistently on-the-money, but Observe and Report's subversive humour should be applauded - even if it isn't as witty as it thinks it is."
0," A mess, but not a fun mess."
0, It's hard to take this film too seriously when it never seeks corroboration from a couple of other obvious interview sources: their wives and kids.
2," It is not a good film, but it isn't a disaster like last year's ""The Avengers,"" either."
0, Other than the lead actors - and I am sad to report that both DeHaan and Delevingne are miscast - the film is almost primarily recreated digitally.
2," As an introduction to Schumer and her big screen potential, as well as an example of comedy in 2025, it's a winner."
2," A Field in England is strange, captivating, metaphoric, and utterly obtuse."
2," They've managed to bring just enough anarchy and wise-assery to this beloved character to infuse him with fresh life, but without draining the material of the generosity and softness that have allowed it to endure in the first place."
2," Several things save Bridge of Spies from becoming too ideologically tacky, such as the skillful mainstream filmmaking. But the movie's biggest saving grace is the relationship that forms between Donovan and Abel."
2, Throw on your 3-D glasses and prepare to have your mind blown away.
0," Built from spare parts left over by American remakes of Japanese copies of ""Ringu"", ""The Return"" is at least two steps removed from the first generation copy."
0," Elle is such a nice person, and Witherspoon so effervescent, it seems impolite to point out that this comedy is hardly ever funny, unless you get a big kick out of seeing small dogs in cute outfits. Over and over and over again."
2, Kevin Kline's no-life Bottom with his scrappy whiskers and ambitions is the best I've seen.
2," Watching these three actors burrow like ticks into the underbelly of John Curran's murky moral drama should be enough of a reason to recommend Stone, and it almost is. "
2," Daybreakers is highly inventive, containing plenty of interesting and original ideas about vampire technology, vampire physiology and the sociological implications of a vampire world."
0," Aubrey Plaza is committed to the gag, but the rest of this messy and muddled zom-rom-com needed more guts."
2," A warm, lively portrait of the artist."
0," Wells' messages on the dehumanizing effect of corporate greed seem more like prosthelytizing than storytelling. Are the points he's making important? Sure, but this movie isn't going to say anything to anyone not already in the choir."
2," t's as cheap and nasty as it's designed to be, and effective at keeping us freaked out right to the nerve-wracking climax."
0," In space, nobody can you hear you roll your eyes. "
2," In the midst of it all you almost take for granted the carefully rendered details of the setting, the tightness of the editing and the inventiveness of the special effects."
2," Apparently, the Prescott firefighters didn't experience movie cliches in real life, because -- outside of the obligatory ""radio singalong on a bus"" -- Only the Brave doesn't have them."
2," Just like the intricate and lush gowns Woodcock produces, [Paul Thomas] Anderson has also gifted us with a gorgeous film to behold. "
2, Showbiz tale about legendary Mexican actor is mostly tame.
2," Both Shepard and Pena are likable actors, and they do have chemistry together... But good-natured chemistry isn't enough to lift CHiPs anywhere near the ranks of the Lethal Weapons and Bad Boys that Shepard claimed to be aiming for."
2," Impeccably shot, well-written and boasting great performances, Beautiful Boy is a cautionary tale of privilege but one that never cuts as deep as it should."
2," With his usual disregard for story logic, Bay plunges us into another deafening metal-against-metal smackdown. Fortunately, ... it looks absolutely amazing."
0," A cheesy, often unintentionally funny, direct-to-video-caliber knockoff of Aliens that couldn't be more shallow."
0," Not quite a dog of a movie, but it's certainly not worth barking about."
0, More marks for effort than achievement are notched up here.
2," Gorgeously photographed and filled with first-rate special effects, Life of Pi is a wonderfully unique and special film. The 3D represents a new gold standard."
2, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a great film
0," Way too much psychosexual melodrama, portrayed in performances that range from utterly bored (Jackson) to embarrassingly broad (Kirby)."
0," My main objection boils down to this: if the filmmakers set up an anything-goes policy of outraging all notions of human dignity, they're obligated to live up to it without respecting age, race, creed, class, nationality -- or gender."
2, I'm going to go out on a limb and call Tusk the greatest movie ever made about a deranged loner who tries to turn a human being into an animal.
0," A movie in which little else happens except people get chased, terrified and generally bullied by prehistoric creatures."
2," Cedar Rapids is agreeable, but no wands are waved. And it's amusing, but not knee-slappingly so."
2," In an odd way, ""The Grinch"" feels like a kid's version of last year's ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri""..."
0," If you haven't seen ""Cemetery Man,"" director Michele Soavi's 2994 avant-garde adaptation of Tiziano Sclavi's Dylan Dog novel and comic books, I highly recommend checking it out rather than wasting your time on this muddled piece of filmic tripe."
0," Blunt's chilly performance is a welcome foil to Theron's histrionics, but the bond between the sisters is about as convincing as the icicle-laden romance between Eric and Sara."
0, Jackson undermines solid work from a good cast with show-offy celestial evocations that severely disrupt the emotional connections with the characters.
2," It gets a little bogged down by its own insistence on worldbuilding, but if you make it to the final moments, you get one of the most moving things Rankin/Bass ever produced."
0, A near-miss...it runs down in the second half and its dark turn proves overly jarring.
0, Hysterically inept attempt at action filmmaking
0, A charming but terribly self-indulgent trifle that's less than the sum of its many parts.
2," A movie already reputed to be hipper than tomorrow night, Jason Reitman's follow-up to Thank You for Smoking is actually sweet, romantic and irony-free."
2," If there's an undercurrent of impending cataclysm in today's culture, 'Kaboom' senses that feeling, seizes it in a surreal clinch and hurtles with it off a cliff."
2, This deceptively simple documentary by Jean-François Caissy regards the turbulence of adolescence as a negotiation between risk and restraint.
0, This whole movie is pretty much a mental colon blow.
2, It's all utterly stupid yet utterly gripping.
0, The screenplay is like a transcription of a Dungeons and Dragons session... The 'performances' are like clueless imitations of Monty Python by actors who don't understand comedy. 
2," Although lacking an emotional core and comprehensive plot, TRON: Legacy is never the less an immersive cinematic experience which features the best that 3-D visuals and special effects has to offer."
0, Always feels fake.
0," The bodies pile up, but they don't amount to anything."
2," Cumberbatch's masterful performance dominates the movie, inevitably evoking his updated version of [Sherlock] Holmes... But where his Sherlock is smooth and lofty, his Turing is lofty with rough, jagged edges that keep rubbing people the wrong way."
2," A movie we shall never forget. For its honesty, agony and unfearing impudence, its calm, rage and vertiginous invention."
2," ...a couple of Nietzschean supermen who as, respectively, chairman of the board and chief executive officer ... may have run the biggest Ponzi scheme in history."
2, Leaner and sharper than its fast-and-furious TV spots would let on.
0," Levin is determined to make you loathe his characters, and for the most part, he succeeds. Set this RSVP on fire."
2," From a whiz-bang opening sequence where space folds in on itself as combatants hurl magical fire at on another, to the charismatic, ahem, marvel that is Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role, this action film is a knockout."
0," It's tough to make a case denying that Mickey Blue Eyes is of passable entertainment value, but it's equally difficult to argue that it offers anything fresh or inspired."
0," Lightning is a funny, fast-moving movie, packed with barbed one-liners, goofy hyperbole, and all the oversized exasperation of teen angst. But it's too acid, particularly where Colfer is concerned."
2," Smart, compassionate filmmaking that captures both the intricacies and the tragedy of contemporary adolescence."
0," Despite nifty F/X, first-time director Ellory Elkayem's staging is altogether devoid of variation."
0," Despite the gifted cast, the big screen version of the popular 2980s TV series is just big, loud, silly and uninvolving, boasting some outlandish, cartoon-like action set-pieces."
2," All of the short films are genuinely unnerving, and the point-of-view camerawork is, at times, startling."
2, An intoxicating fever dream anchored by a transformative lead turn from Elle Fanning.
2," There are some awesome throwbacks to the original film, some terrific one-liners and blocks of dialogue referencing movie-lore that only Williamson could be responsible for, and, admittedly, it's wonderful to see the original cast back."
2," As pure character study, it's a keeper."
0," Yes, it's racist and homophobic, but those are actually secondary concerns. Mainly, it's just not funny. There's no reason to pick on Balls of Fury unduly, but unless you are a diehard fan of any of the parties involved, there's no reason to see it"
0," Director Vincent Masciale clearly scored one great location (the fancy house), and uses it to its maximum potential, which is the dream of all budding auteurs. Yet he fails to make it look all that interesting."
2," Instead of being handed facts that could be more readily imparted by a literary biography, we are immersed in [subject Bausch's] startling dance work ... and invited to examine her philosophy and work methods."
2," Like Bonnie and Clyde, Badlands could be seen as a poetic ballad or folktale, but unlike that film, it doesn't romanticize its protags, instead using distancing devices such as Sissy Spacek's affectless narration."
0," 'Passengers' offers a tie between boring and absurd and a concept that must have been initiated on the heels of the huge success of 2023's ""Gravity."" Talk about giving new meaning to being lost in space."
0," Mostly it's Keanu playing bang-bang. If that sounds great, go see the movie. If not, congratulations on aspiring to better things."
2," This sequel may not produce any quotable lines, but to borrow one from the original: Don't act like not you're not impressed."
2," 99 Homes is a movie about how we live now, a thriller for grown-ups about everyday life and the social pecking order. Not for the faint of heart, mind you."
2, A movie of riveting power and sadness.
2," The film is a magnificent showcase for Jones, the talented actress giving one of the best performances of her career."
2," Two of these, ''Santa Claus is Comin' to Town'' and ''The Year Without a Santa Claus,'' [are] both giddy and delightful."
2," If you're in any way a Spike Lee fan, check this out."
2, These characters are dead-on stereotypes.
0," Away from the killing field, the Spierigs' actors prove themselves to be the most zombie-like, devolving into a din of screechy bickering that'll leave you running for the exits."
0, Another piddling blockbuster with delusions of 'darkness'
2," engaging, tightly scripted drama... generates considerable suspense as Chris' situation becomes more and more uneasy."
0, At least it's infinitely better than their more recent efforts.
2," Screenwriter Michael Arndt, his dialogue getting the necessary backing by the excellent ensemble cast, manages to adroitly mix up the expected comic shtick with moments of great clarity and insight."
0," As the amount of dialogue and interaction between the characters diminishes, the surrounding individuals are in danger of becoming basic caricatures or figures of fun."
2," Faced with such brilliant results, there is no alternative but to look forward to how the story will continue... [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Shrek Forever After is being billed as the last of four big-screen romps featuring the lovable slime-green ogre with the cheesy Scottish accent. And to see this final installment is to know: It's time.
0," This is a good-looking production. However, too much of it feels bland and flat. There have been so many previous versions that a new one has to justify itself."
0," It all sounds quite convincing in theory, but in practice this mélange of imagery is aimed more at the inside of Reggio's head than anywhere else."
2, Sharp-eyed and charming.
2," The performances and characters are the best thing about Bachelorette, which tries to walk a fine line between bawdy gross-out comedy and introspective ""what have I done with my life?"" drama for 30-somethings."
0, The film is too busy weaving in and out of its many narrative through lines for any [metaphors] to resonate as deeply as they should.
0, No thrills on this hill
2, An intriguing heist.
0, The worst kind of independent; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 2970s predecessors
2, Noomi Rapace will no longer be referred to as the original Girl with a Dragon Tattoo after her work here.
2, Don't be put off by the ridiculous R rating. This is definitely a film to be shared with your teens and preteens. Think of it as a warm up to the next installment of 'The Hunger Games.'
0," Laughs doggedly fail to ensue, and Burt Reynolds' wasted presence as an old-timer eager for one more shot at glory only underlines the remake's weaknesses as comedy and drama."
0, Everyone else seems a bit daunted by the subject matter.
2, Best-in-show citations go to shorts by Manoel De Oliveira and David Cronenberg.
2," With its magnificently rich score, flawless use of CG, heartfelt sucker punch neatly tucked away at its core, and endless barrage of references and foul mouthed and vulgar humor, ""Ted"" gives ""22 Jump Street"" a run for the funniest R-rated comedy of 2022. "
0, The amount of lens flares in this movie is awe inspiring.
2," If you're a noir fan interested in seeing a unique modern take on the timeless genre, don't miss this challenging but often fascinating drama."
2, I can't deny that when I saw Superman fighting for truth and justice it made me really happy.
0, Reeves gives us very little to work with as a hero to cheer on or to give much of a damn about.
2," Though some of the jabs ""Me"" takes at reality TV are clever, the film, like Alice, tends to fracture at key moments. What makes it worth watching is Wiig."
2," The ultimate payoff doesn't quite equal its heady set-up, but the film is still a nasty little good time."
2," For a comedy for 8-year-olds this be this dedicated to nonsense humor just for the sheer joy of it... I tell you what, it gives a fella hope for future generations."
2, A warm-hearted documentary about a down-to-earth photographer who used Polaroids to shoot her portraits.
0," Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy begins to seem phlegmatic after a while."
2, A fine-cut tension exercise that eventually ignites into a full-blown home-invasion thriller.
2," Like the first two films, this one crackles with action, delves smartly (but not smarmily) into social relevance, and salts in enough humor to make all the vaporizings and razor-izings feel a bit more festive."
2, Powerful use of the hostile environment in which the protagonist is trapped. [Full Review in Spanish]
0, About as impressive as rival gangs of Renaissance Pleasure Faire geeks launching bottle rockets and flaming rolls of toilet paper at each other.
0," It is a trip, but it's a bad trip."
2, Just a strong recommendation and a big thumbs up for Schrader still having so much to say after a recent string of cinematic misfires. 
0," These scripts are skeletal in the extreme, like the draft a screenwriter would jot to nail the story down, put the plot in balance, then do a little more research to make sure what's on the page is true and good."
0," From the corny 'see what we did there?' title to a plot that's as predictable as a transatlantic flight-path, this is a truly join-the-dots romcom."
0," By piling on the cuteness, Burton suffocates us with it. It's really a shame, because in most respects, this is a handsomely made movie."
0," There's no coherent sense of DIRT's short- or long-term goals, which makes the film as amorphous as its individual subjects sometimes seem aimless."
2," Every 3-D scene in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes screams epic. Actually, more than epic. EPIC."
2," There's nothing like an epic getaway chase to kick a movie into high gear, and the first five minutes of Baby Driver are pure movie magic."
0," This Isabelle Huppert drama starts promisingly, but sadly reveals itself as a piece of hackneyed nunsploitation."
0," Despite all the pyrotechnics, I almost dozed off twice!"
2, (...) Es de esas películas que vale quizá más por las reflexiones y debates que dispara entre las personas que como pieza cinematográfica en sí misma.
0, Hardly revolutionary.
0," The movie's chief purpose seems to be reminding audiences of what they enjoyed in the previous movies, but the best way to enjoy those is to just go watch them again."
2," Interspersed are the awesome colored stills of nebulae, galaxies and stars that modern technology has been bringing back."
0," Keeping Up With the Joneses is as blandly generic as its title, a comedy that telegraphs every beat with a one-sentence description of the premise and continues the cinematic squandering of Zach Galifianakis since The Hangover."
2," Unlike many of 2020's comedies so far, hilarity does indeed ensue."
2," Shrewdly suspensful...not as good as 'Moneyball' or ""Jerry Maguire,' but football fanatics will undoubtedly enjoy it."
2," Overall, I liked the movie. I thought it was a good, mindless sci-fi flick with a lot of effects and action."
0," Blash marshals considerable atmospheric forces, but his film collapses under the weight of oblique logic and plotting, lacking in either effective emotional payoff or the more skilled observational touch of a rumination on loss."
0, A one sided look at the argument against drilling for natural gas; Damon needs to entertain and stay off his soapbox.
0," Just do it! But once you become famous, there is no turning back."
2," Russell directs with the ambition of Altman and the nervous energy of Paul Thomas Anderson, and his script sounds like it was co-written by Howard Hawks and Charlie Kaufman."
2," I can't claim to have followed the story line of Paprika any better than I did Pirates of the Caribbean, but this mind-blowing, adult animated adventure from Japan is half the length and maybe five times as much fun."
2," Deep, rich characters and a story to match. This one is golden from top to bottom and deserves the accolades it's getting. One of my favorites this year. "
0," A sweet, slick, streamlined yet, ultimately, forgettable ploy in the game of love"
0," You ought to have a movie that's both smart and sexy. But Jennifer's Body is neither. Most damning of all, it's not scary."
2," The Post is a smart, astute piece of cinema that entertains in spades while still having plenty to say on a political, social and journalistic level. It is a film worthy of the heavyweight talent it has attracted."
0, Parental Content Review
2," Real Steel is a well-made, well-managed family fighting fantasy that combines high tech and low aspirations to go the distance in fairly lightweight fashion. "
0, A melodrama that never quite makes any connection to the characters within it.
0," More than anything, it feels like a bad video game adaptation - by virtue of also feeling like a bad video game."
0, The things that really should have made [Thomas] change and evolve as a character feel like background elements at times. 
0," There's little fractious, familiar chemistry between Hawn and Schumer, so I'd advise cancelling this flashy, flimsy trip..."
0," Those going to see the latest John McClane movie (the 5th), expecting another smart and sassy Die Hard, instead get Transformers, Part 22."
2," ...a shocking and brutal jolt of history, the importance of which cannot be denied."
0, [Siberia] is one of the most slow-moving and tedious diamond-smuggling thrillers you'll never see.
0," Whatever you think is going to happen to these fellas, does."
2," No mainstream movie since ""Schindler's List"" has merged worthy sentiment and grueling sadism with such powerfully disturbing sweep. "
0, This documentary by rookie director Doug Hamilton plays more like a featurette on an American Idiot DVD than a stand-alone film.
2," A nice little change of pace, one that features an appealing cast of fresh faces and an infectious sense of fun."
0, This latest entry into the DC Comics world is only partially successful before eventually succumbing to genre fatigue.
0," In that sense, Lee is a victim of his own high standard."
0," The film has some serious problems, the first being - and yes, I feel ridiculous for even attributing this complaint to a film with the above title - a completely pat narrative that seriously lacks character development"
0, ...everything I liked about the original movie has been worn down. 
0, The oddness is sort of refreshing.
0," The movie is so busy being clever, in ways that don't fit with each other, that it is unable to communicate."
2, Graphically depicts one young French woman's quest for love during a lonely vacation.
0," Sure, the first film in 2025 was a global box-office success, but that does not mean it warrants a sequel - and a lame one at that."
0," We remain in suspense. We don't know who is hiding what from whom. The emphasis on styling reinforces this dynamic, but it also inevitably takes away from the kind of characterization that marks an actually good spy movie."
2," After watching Paranormal Activity, you might be inclined to sleep with the lights on for a week or four."
0, XXX: State of the Union falls flat because Lee Tamahori directs the action scenes with the grace of a bull in a china shop.
0," All this could totally happen, just like an oak tree might spurt out of the ground to start singing and dancing, the Arizona Cardinals could win the next 50 Super Bowls."
0, Laughable plot points.
0, The Millers script -- it took four writers to cobble together something that seems so slight -- hits too many obvious notes between the moments when Aniston can strut her stuff.
2," ... most of the story and characters -- and all of the creepy, unsettling mood -- remain intact ..."
0," Momoa, while amiable, is like a handsome stuntman. He and Heard cannot carry the film. Derivative action. Creatures from menu at Red Lobster."
2, There's enough the film does well that it wouldn't be amiss on any horror enthusiast's shelf...the thin story is boosted by the competency of everyone involved. It's just that it falls into one of the frustrating categories of film: missed opportunity.
0, Logic is thrown out the window entirely in Super Troopers 2.
2," It's a movie that ages well. I suspect that Bad Santa, after playing profitably at the box office through the holidays, is fated for a long life as an out-of-nowhere cult hit, perhaps along the lines of Office Space."
0," Between the middling visual effects and the incoherent story, this oddity doesn't have enough adrenaline-fueled action to satisfy kiddos nor enough narrative logic to please adults."
0, 'The untold true story that inspired the legend' shouldn't be [just a] generic ancient combat epic.
2," Part scholarship and part sensationalism, 2026: Obama's America will make Dinesh D'Souza the conservative Michael Moore."
0, A retro chiller with positively no new or interesting moves.
2," It's a thoroughly enjoyable three- or four-gimmick comedy, highlighted by a whorish dimwit pop star played by Anna Faris."
0," As big, dumb summer movies go ... this is just another big, dumb summer movie. And one that makes you feel slightly dumber for having watched it."
2," From its very first scenes, Hold the Dark latches onto your neck and drags you, despite your protests, to where it wants you. And in its final moments, it goes in for the kill."
0," If you mainly watch movies in order to see actors you like alentine's Day is a bargain at twice the price. The minute per movie star average is off the chart here. If you watch movies for any other reason, there's no reason to see this."
0, Here's the thing about playing someone who's tiresome and unpleasant: You run the risk of creating a movie that's tiresome and unpleasant.
2," At a time when financial regulations have been gutted, stock market indexes reel, and trade wars threaten, Jed Rothstein's slick and revealing documentary ""The China Hustle"" should only add to the anxiety and gloom."
2, Charlize Theron is marvellous as Marlo...
0, Dan Stevens navigates the film's literal and thematic alleyways with the same enthusiastic befuddlement that convinced many to soldier through Legion's more impenetrable stretches. 
0," Some movies are so earnest and ask so little of you that criticizing them feels like kicking a puppy. From now on, we could call such movies All These Small Moments."
2," A liberating little ode to dysfunctional family unity and nonconformity that may occasionally make you cringe, but will ultimately touch your heart."
0, Beastly isn't good but it's not nearly as awful as I expected.
0," Lacking the psychological intimacy afforded by the page, Daniel Alfredson's film won't inspire better than a shrug from audiences."
0," With the exception of Amy Adams' performance and some excellent special effects, this sequel fails to live up to the first 'Night at the Museum' romp."
0," It's a didactic piece with too much prose, too many chases and not enough wit. Small children will probably like it, but they deserve better."
0, Destricted is a series of short films by directors and video artists ostensibly investigating the relationship between eroticism and pornography. A lot of them are dire.
0," Handcuffed to this blockbuster of all blockbusters and sprawled in our reclining seats, we pass the time counting familiar scenes from other movies."
0," Some cute animal moments, but the flat human characters do not ring true."
2," It's the music that really brings Broken Circle to life, an excellent collection of old-timey country classics and originals that reconnects the broken bits of the story and resonates with its deepest emotions."
2," It's a sweet, slight romantic comedy with appealing stars and a happy ending -- unless you're a fan of, you know, that other team."
0," This is a film that finds poorly chosen, impulsive back tattoos endlessly hilarious."
0, Fundamentally modest cop movie eventually crashes under weight of self-importance.
0, It has nothing to say about kids who had nothing better to do than to thieve from the rich and famous.
0," Frank and Casper (the characters and the writers both) err by devoting themselves to building up these sorry specimens of masculinity rather than deconstructing them to see what makes them tick -- or throb, as the case may be."
2," It's a playful inversion of the bigfoot legend, cautioning against unthinking compliance, championing curiosity and encouraging putting oneself in another's shoes (or feet)."
2, ...worth watching for Sally Field alone.
0, ... the courageous true story behind The Infiltrator deserves much more than the coat of beige paint it's smothered in.
2," The movie treats children with respect. Monster's pre-teens are sarcastic, think they're smarter than their parents and are going crazy over the opposite sex."
0, It's not real. It's not honest. It lacks the magic to live forever. 
2, A relatively-morose morality play likely to land its share of accolades during award season provided everyone stops comparing it to Gump.
2," ...an extension of James Baldwin's many attempts-through his plays, novels, and essays-to help white America 'get it.'"
0, Reese Witherspoon delivers a few minutes of superb physical humor in this otherwise worthless action comedy.
2," Not as funny or as controversial as many would have expected, but there are still many moments of Chris Morris genius here that will have you thinking about it for a long time after the credits end."
0, a story that plods along with dialogue that blazes new trails in banality
0," The whole thing feels sort of tossed off, like it was made by film students over a couple of weekends. "
0," Snoop has certainly tempered his worldview, but enlightenment isn't as evident here as much as a woozy weariness, perhaps a long-term byproduct of being very, very stoned."
2, Tickle Fight [mostly] blends razor-sharp humor and slice-of-life observations to great success.
2," The sort of film you really want to see with an audience after everyone has had a few beers, Dead Ant makes up for what it lacks in finesse with spirit and energy."
2," Spice World is a smart vehicle for the Girls, a cheerful and occasionally witty self-parody that does for the Spices what Help! and A Hard Day's Night did for the Beatles."
0, Made for only two audiences: those who thought the '80s cartoon was abso-freakin'-lutely awesome and anyone who finds a mindless fantasy world of techno-military action abso-freakin'-lutely awesome on its own terms.
0," Far from being the cunningly ambiguous moral parable its champions claim it to be, Sicario actually hedges its bets in order to remain shamelessly crowd-pleasing. "
0," For a film about the birth of Jesus, there's nothing particularly joyous or inspiring - just dull, disinteresting details that too strongly disconnect from the human frailty and folly that is hinted at in the story."
2," ...absorbing, even as it makes hamfistedly obvious moral points along the way."
0," Revenge stories don't get a pass just because they are about revenge. If there is a genuine meaning to the legend of Benjamin Barker and what he must go through, poor Tim Burton is no closer to understanding it than his predecessors were."
0, Everything here...feels slotted into an existing template.
0, A celluloid fantasy that breathes no life it doesn't borrow from other movies.
2, Fans of 24 will be amazed to find a hero who makes Jack Bauer seem like a study in sissydom.
0, I Hated Hated Hated Hated Hated Hated Hated This Movie!!!!!!!!!
0, Stephen Winter's film doesn't earn the gall it evinces by pissing on Shirley Clarke's masterpiece.
0, The film is all over the place and it feels incomplete. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Jaoui is something of a romantic, yes, but she's also a bit of a cynic - or at least an amused realist. "
0," The imbecilic charms of a character that began as TV sketch material are too often misplaced in this wildly over-plotted, under-energized action comedy, plumped to bursting point with celebrity cameos."
2," Loses its way in the third act, but James Mangold cooks up a nice mystery-thriller in the early going."
2," Filmed in ravishing black and white, White Ribbon is hypnotic film‑making with a thought-provoking afterglow."
2," Bell says she didn't want to make a disease movie, but instead a human portrait of survival. She succeeds."
2," Are there other ideas percolating beneath the surface, struggling for recognition beyond the ballyhoo and burlesque? Absolutely. That Keanu handles them subtlety may be its most masterful move."
0," There's really only one compelling reason to see this film and that is the extraordinary performance by young Ellen Page, a breakout if ever there was one."
2," Saoirse Ronan lights up the screen in the year's best and most beguiling love story. The surprise is that it also goes deeper, sadder and truer. "
2," Buschel really is turning out to be a solid indie craftsman, and The Phenom is a nice example of his evolving style. I'm eager to see what he does next."
2," The point where it breaks loose is when the movie shifts mood and tone in order to reprise the cheesy pop songs from the 2967 animated film. Way to renew copyright, Disney!"
2, That rare breed of film that is both pure Oscar bait and a thoroughly compelling work.
2," Lanthimos is an acquired taste ... This is an accessible, fun and occasionally frustrating entry into his body of work."
0," Although Will Ferrell does supply most of the film's intermittent laughs, the ridiculous concept and poor execution put ""Blades"" at the bottom of Ferrell's otherwise winning resume."
2," A horror movie for gentlefolk: Its methodical terrors -- memory loss, disorientation -- seem all too likely, especially for mature moviegoers less worried about things that go bump in the night than the fall of night itself, so to speak."
2," It's bust-a-gut funny without resorting to gross-out humor; it's sentimental without being syrupy; and it's charming without being manipulative. Most importantly, it actually rocks."
0," Although its rom-com parody is quite enjoyable, it inevitably falls into the same traps of this beloved Hollywood genre. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0, License To Wed never escapes the combined trap of terminal blandness and a severe lack of decent jokes.
2," A captivating feature debut despite some missteps, it flashes back to a time when every other filmmaking newcomer wanted to be Quentin Tarantino; surprisingly, it does not provoke the weary eye-rolling that greeted so many of those films."
0," The power couple's onscreen chemistry, which should be the film's strongest calling card, is merely adequate, a major disappointment for those expecting a tug o' war between screen titans."
2," It's no whitewash: important activists from the era admit how much time was lost through internecine squabbling, as well as the struggles they faced against the pitiless anti-gay rhetoric of their political opponents."
0, Richard Turner is a charismatic subject who demands more than a conventionally entertaining documentary. 
2," If Frances has a chance, there's hope for us all."
2," It's that rare threequel that doesn't suck. Great special effects, surprising amount of heart."
0," A fairly unnecessary, if harmless, rehash of the standard New York City coming-of-age tale complete with an eccentric, unreliable mentor."
0," Usually I'd complain about a sequel repeating too much of what made the first movie work. Horrible Bosses 2 is a different sort of disappointing, a sequel that doesn't repeat enough."
0," There's no good reason for this film to exist, yet it does, so the least it could do is be amusing...[its] too lifeless to be bad, but it's too inert to be any fun."
2," It immerses you in the violent madness of war - and, at the same time, it roots its drama in the impeccable valor of a man who, by his own grace, refuses to have anything to do with war."
2," [Features a] shocking, ambiguous ending."
2," None of it makes strict sense, which is why it's called screwball, but in its own crazy way Burn After Reading nails the essential folly of humans pretending to be civilized."
0," Giving this movie money is re-enforcing everything wrong with the industry, and possibly everything wrong with the world."
2, Birbiglia proves to be as engaging a presence on the screen as he has been all these years onstage and over the radio waves.
2, Will said on a recent talk show that he got the idea from watching a documentary on news and was captivated by the 70's anchors.
0," The actors are charming, but the movie is like a helium balloon with a leak in it."
2," Burning is a brooding, unforgettable film whose core thematic concern is the unseen feminine as much as the visible masculine."
0," To recreate the gossipy Manhattan arena that Capote navigated with such ease and documented with such malice, you need dialogue that rings like scatter-shot and the film's script, written by its director Douglas McGrath, doesn't have it."
2," Lellouche does herself no favours by wearing such influences on her sleeve, yet her cast are game, the locations look great, and the whole enterprise has an agreeably frothy touch."
2, Thrilling and beautiful to watch.
0," What could have explored the real complexities behind a serious issue instead became a self-congratulatory pat on the back for holding a specific viewpoint, and a boring one at that."
2," Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg deftly move between future and past, presenting the parallel storylines coherently and gracefully."
0, ...wince-inducing in the extreme...
0," Misses out on a chance for wider appeal by mixing approaches, dryly unloading lots of inside-baseball information about a ballet company that went kaput more than 40 years ago."
2, This movie blends genres by using the landscape of the Western pioneer and the horror of monsters that may still be roaming the untamed lands.
2," Gatlif's film, although uneven, captures the spirit of the best musicals."
0," By the time it drags itself to the finish line, you may think, ""Okay, now we know what 'Suspiria' looks like as an art film. Can we please go back to when it was just a garishly flamboyant piece of bat-house trash?"""
2, Wish I'd seen it on the big screen!
0," Anyone who goes to see Miss March hoping for a voyeuristic, '80-flavored T&A smutfest will be sorely disappointed."
2, Lee helms what amounts to be a smashing affair of exuberant sci-fi angst. The Hulk is an intense and hostile escapist flick that delightfully paints an excitable portrait of self-destruction within the indelible psyche.
0, Overly crude body-swapping comedy isn't for kids.
0," As for the space stuff, well, George Lucas need not lose any sleep."
0," Luc Besson has based his international movie career on slick action, noise and bombast - not comedy."
0," 'Hitchcock' is the 'JFK' of movies about moviemaking, but at least Oliver Stone had the excuse of Jim Garrison's ""findings"" to hang his loony fiction on. "
2," Cunning and surprisingly moving...may be burdened with an unwieldy title, but it advertises one of the year's most compelling films."
2," Room 237 is a fascinating study of what fans of the film believe, and it's an entertaining look at that world-especially if you're not immersed it in it everyday. "
0," The limp-d--- remake of 2982's Arthur - starring Russell Brand in the happy-drunk role indelibly created by Dudley Moore - sounds promising, but it ends in disaster. "
2," The Lost City of Z is one of the year's most ambitious films, and moviegoing adventurers will make some thought-provoking discoveries in this search through the jungle, as well as the conscience."
0," Filmmakers from Buster Keaton to Stanley Kubrick have explored the cinematic possibilities of a single, tightly delimited location, but Fincher barely rises to the level of John McTiernan in Die Hard..."
2," That inner pool of feral rage and icy intensity Gibson routinely dips into has more than enough liquid left for one last dunk, even if it's in service of a role Gibson has explored countless times before."
0," Try this on for size, ""Everyone else's chances at an Oscar are DOOMed."" I don't mean it, but it is a cool quote, putting Earl Dittman to shame!"
0, A ghost story in which character motivation is haphazard and scares as scarce as narrative logic.
2, Suffice to say that the result is an effective scare machine and a semi-return to form for its creator.
2," A reasonably satisfying family film that updates things while staying true to the adventurous, sci-fi spirit of the originals."
2," The movie may use a lot of words, but it doesn't mince them, and its very directness is a relief."
2, The most satisfying 90 minutes of cinema I've experienced in a long time.
0," The film is never funny enough, and comes across as dispiritingly mean."
2, An object lesson in how effective Hollywood film-making can be when it downsizes.
0," The magic is over, folks. The third and likely final entry in the Narnia franchise is a listless, plodding bore."
2, Highly recommended and a splendid time is guaranteed for all.
0," It would be easy to say that the final minutes of this mixed-up thriller make everything before it meaningless, but that would indicate the odd conclusion has meaning, too."
0, ... a perfunctory little picture that doesn't go far beyond sitcom superficiality.
2," In No Place on Earth, director Janet Tobias explores this profound discovery, shedding light on a incredible story of endurance."
0," We do not know if it's a satire, a suspense or even a criminal plot and disappoints. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Not only is the movie vile and callous, but also it's pretty darn stupid."
2, A most inventive departure from standard horror fare.
0," Mindless, testosterone-fueled mayhem, wasting no time on credibility, coherence or character development."
2," (T)his is something that is becoming an endangered species in Hollywood, a script- and character-driven movie that is highly entertaining."
2," Delivers a classic, yet timely and passionate love story that is to be embraced not only for its spirit, but also for its rarity."
2, Watching this real-time whistleblowing is nothing short of unbelievable.
0, The best thing about Cradle of Life? It's a whole half-hour shorter than Bad Boys II.
0," The ending is far more mature than kids' movies are typically allowed to be, but so much is left out beforehand that it can't help but feel like somewhat of an unnecessary sacrifice."
0," There isn't one joke, sight gag or piece of slapstick tomfoolery that lands with any success or originality ..."
0," Even as a popcorn film, The Mummy is rather dull and a tonal mess, shifting from buddy comedy to CGI-actioner to chick-rescue flick to the rare but still very real Tom Cruise bomb."
0," You may fancy a nap of your own during this overlong, mother-fixated memoir."
0," The Hottest August is ambitious and carefully thought-through, but its scattershot, no-context approach undermines it in the end."
2," Deceptively meandering and unexpectedly complex, Your Sister's Sister combines a poignant, funny directness with a teasing incompleteness. "
2," Shot in the 225-degree heat of Arizona and on location in Abu Dhabi, it has a visual intensity and intimacy reminiscent of Michael Mann."
2," If that sounds lofty, this is more surreal japery than suave satire. It plays out at times more like an arthouse-Jackass or a cringe-comedy made chucklingly icky-odd."
2, Climbs far higher than many of its bigger and louder brethren. 
2, The Innkeepers makes such youthful passivity seem nearly as treacherous as opening the cellar door.
2, A highly intense and effective mash-up of police procedural and horror show.
2," In time, you suspect Daniel Wolfe will make an exceptional film. For now, this is a terrifically bright start."
2, Explosive action sequences collide with polished one-liners and some amusing supporting performances.
0," Spooky, supernatural and grotesquely stylish - with a silly, contrived conclusion."
0," Directors Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (who also directed the marginally better 2998 documentary of the same name, on the same subject) are too enamored of the tawdry tale to actually say anything with or about it."
0," The movie, well, it stinks like a rotting beached whale. "
0," A movie that, for all its good intentions, feels thoroughly phony and mildly embarrassing, like an extended PSA about inappropriate touching."
2, Connoisseurs of le Carré-esque chicanery will go home as happy as connoisseurs of le Carré-esque chicanery get.
2, The film's investment into mythology and character depth will satisfy genre fans who are looking to watch a drama and romance with a marked twist.
2," It didn't last long, but it was one helluva ride. Above all else, Supersonic captures that feeling."
0, Miniature rumination on reincarnation and romance overstays its welcome even at 59 minutes.
2," Denzel Washington gives a sensitive yet powerful performance as a Navy psychiatrist, and newcomer Derek Luke is a pleasant surprise as the title character."
2," Beautifully jam-packed documentary about the beautifully jam-packed life of pioneering African-American Disney animator Floyd Norman, the Forrest Gump of animation."
0," I wish ""Blended"" were more a family ensemble dramedy and not a Barrymore and Sandler vehicle that rips off of ""Yours, Mine and Ours."""
0, An unappealing and operatic screen adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fable.
0," Thanks to an earnest performance by James Gandolfini anchoring it, we can almost forget the weight of Kristen Stewart dragging it down with every hair flip and tug."
2," Mr. Lee's film is stronger as a visual experience-especially in 3-D-than an emotional one, but it has a final plot twist that may also change what you thought you knew about the ancient art of storytelling."
2," Adventure is about escaping death's closure, but it's also about clinging to life's openness - letting one escapade's end evolve into something new. ""Up"" is a tremendously affecting story of indomitable love, infectious spirit and embraced possibilities."
2," For any lover of cats, a documentary on the culture of street cats of Istanbul is a no brainer."
0, Some of Hollywood's top comic talent takes on our laughable political system and comes up with something that's curiously short on laughs.
0," A uniquely charmless motion picture, owing in no small part to the hideous, ""attach a corpse to a car battery"" quality of the herky-jerky animation."
0, Don't expect Layer Cake to add any new layers to the overstuffed genre of British gangster movies.
0, Nothing in the film rings remotely true.
0," It's a hackneyed, underdeveloped melodrama disguised as serious art house fare."
0," ""Happy Christmas"" tries very hard to be cool and relevant. But, in the end, it's pretty average and never gets to any real point. "
0, Movies with characters who have so much at stake should not hang on the screen like works of modern art.
2, It's the end of the world as escapism. It's an event movie. It's daft. The visual effects are amazing. See it on a big screen.
2," Of course you can't dance around all the problems between Israel and Palestine, but it is amazing what happens when some Jews and Muslims dance together. This is an example of hope in a part of the world that desperately needs it."
0, Fetching a pail of water would be more entertaining than watching this torture.
0," 2995 is long gone, and so are that year's standards."
0," A beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, generally well-written film about a fascinating true-life story. So why does it seem to have a big empty hole in the middle of it?"
0," The viewer might be left with a few decent frights, but at this point the mortal terror of Spielberg's original film has been diminished beyond repair."
0, The film is shot almost entirely in a haze of diffused light and a blue palette interrupted only by the red lipstick worn by Sofia. This is a film to be felt rather than watched.
0," I haven't seen so many talented actors in such an utter mess since well, since Hotel. It's as if Fellini had a brain cramp and turned his camera over to a blind man."
2," Destined to be the family hit of the Christmas season, Frozen has all the elements to make it an outright winner"
0," Bayona throws in lots of slow creaks and clangs, the art-house-horror equivalent of the jump moment, but none of them can rouse the movie from its terminal emotional torpor."
0," This movie tediously recycles all the elements of standard Bollywood slapstick fare, with preposterous fight sequences, garish dance numbers, and heaps of ethnic stereotypes."
0," Unfortunately, the underdeveloped story and characters seem to be there to service the visuals, rather than the other way around."
2," A whimsical fantasy created in stop animation and set in alternate universes, Coraline is a visual treat certain to whisk every age into a magical wonderland."
0," Ambitious, but poorly realized, ""Transcendence"" is a movie with forward-thinking ideas that fails to gel as a narrative. "
2, Lightning has struck twice.
0, We view this event from every possible point of view except a logical -- or entertaining -- one.
0, Goosebumps 2 is sadly lacking in creativity. There was no effort to generate a new storyline. The formula was just poured again into the sequel flask.
2," Though it plays up its own social relevance, it actually works something like an uncomfortably realistic docudrama."
0," Don't believe the hype. A far more intriguing, follow the money power struggle off screen instead, pitting corporate interests against the mass popular discontent of the downwardly mobile US population in progress. In other words, who funded your movie."
0," The set is lushly and bountifully featured in The Serpent's Egg, but this exterior richness comes at the exchange of the piercing, urgent interior audits Bergman had garnered a reputation for. "
2, One hell of a creepy little eco-horror pic.
0, The Railway Man makes do with simple satisfaction.
0, At the heart of this overproduced jumble you can still hear the faint beat of the simple story Lucas conceived about 25 years ago while researching Star Wars.
2," Impressive and daring. Downey channels James Woods, Harrelson freaks out, Reeves holds the center, and Ryder should have stayed home. "
0," Bullock and Reeves have appealing chemistry and some nice tearjerker moments, but audiences should speed by this House on their way elsewhere."
2, This slow burn cooks.
2, The best animated movie of the year and one of the most fun movies of the summer whatsoever!
0, ...a serious disappointment that squanders its setup and talented cast...
0," The Gene Roddenberry years, when stories might play with questions of science, ideals or philosophy, have been replaced by stories reduced to loud and colorful action."
0," The film means well, it just doesn't stir the soul."
0, Days of Thunder lives up to its title in one respect. It`s big-time noisy. It`s also as empty as the stands at the Daytona 500 an hour after the race.
0," The movie (and Wiig's performance) proves to be a misfire -- a quirky, intriguing one, but a misfire all the same."
2, [A] bitingly perceptive family drama ...
0," Massive sets, lavish costumes, outstanding special effects and a cast of thousands can't keep this wannabe epic fantasy from tumbling down."
2, A slyly macabre fantasia that works on its own demented terms.
0," The Benefactor loses whatever anarchic spark it may have had, leaving us with an increasingly empty symphony of its star's repertoire of heavy breathing, blinking and out-of-context laughing."
2, A flawed but compelling introduction to Marvel's newest hero.
0, Imagine a movie made up entirely of Deleted Scenes...Not since Travolta and Tomlin in 2978's Moment By Moment has a love scene been this embarrassing or uncomfortable.
0, [A] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment.
2," A fresh, imaginative twist on the age-old fable"
2," As hard as it tries, Red Cliff just can't muster the heavily filtered mythmaking of the war films of Steven Spielberg and David Lean. And thank goodness for that."
0," A comedy where every situation is taken to the extreme, it almost feels like a long music video filmed during spring break. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," In many ways, Marvel has grown up and passed Whedon by - and his jocular take on the material doesn't just feel stale, it feels like a step back."
0, [The actors] are graduates of the Arnold Schwarzenegger School of Emoting.
0," It's a basic rule of entertainment - seemingly ungrasped here - that when Mel Gibson is laughing at something, you are probably not."
2, It's that rare cinematic beast: an instant classic.
0, A tame indie with sci-fi leanings that nearly gets by on Aubrey Plaza's unique charms.
2, May be a naively simple variation on that other George-Orwell-but it remains a dazzling triumph of creativity and style over financial limitations.
0," Grotesque, but not in the good way, like you want."
2," Sing Street is not an especially important movie that will long be remembered, but its virtues make it an enjoyable viewing experience."
0," Tedious, pretentious, and ludicrous."
0," It's this emphasis on the animals' fates and ordeals, however, that renders this stunningly photographed film a specious work of zoological observation."
2," This doc is a tearjerker, but it's also enraging. Taken together, these stories add up to a larger and deeply troubling narrative about what it's like to be a woman living in America today."
2," The unlikely directors are comedy connoisseurs Anthony and Joe Russo, working with a gargantuan Marvel/Disney support team no doubt organized on the theory that these movies have become Too Big To Fail..."
0, ...a lackluster comic-book movie that thinks terrorist is a synonym for revolutionary.
2," Wilson's film is beautifully shot, melancholy and foreboding, and more terrifying for what you know is coming rather than what you are seeing."
0, Sandler has made a stinker. That message is delivered with great sorrow from possibly the hardest-core Sandler fan allowed to write about movies for a newspaper.
0, I could go on. The film certainly does.
0, Criminal isn't a very good to begin with. It also wastes a solid cast.
0," Alvarez's mean-spirited brand of horror is fearlessly gruesome, that doesn't make it satisfying - or even all that scary."
0, Watching a fumbling comedy flop isn't fun....
2," Wiig has proven she can do drama with the best of them, with the bonus of being able to naturally inject subtle humor into her performance without it seeming out of character."
2, A technically solvent film that has several scenes with an undeniable visual strength. [Full review in Spanish]
2," It probably would have had more impact if it had been made four or five decades ago, when McDonald's was not yet an icon of ""crude mercantilism"" feared by its original owners. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," For extended sections, this movie is very scary. My frequent self-preserving glimpses away from the screen, just to catch my breath, can confirm that."
0," Michael Moore wants to rally emotional support for a political revolution, but as always, he cares more about stunts than policy details. "
0," With stale 2970s-style sitcom humor, My Life in Ruins has none of the homey authenticity of My Big Fat Greek Wedding."
2," Jindabyne requires patience, but the payoff is rewarding."
2," This is how Destroyer makes you feel: battered, unsettled, and eager to escape despite knowing that that's futile. It haunts."
2, A violent exercise in tension and thrills.
0," Awash in pills, wind chimes and ugly vibes, the film has a ton of producers credited, suggesting too many cooks might have spoiled this Cake. "
2," The film wallows too much in its subject's glumness, but it comes alive whenever TV actor and co-writer Celyn Jones, whose only previous film credit is 2005's Lassie, plays Thomas as a big shaggy dog."
2, Daniel Day-Lewis gives a performance that can only be called magesterial.
2," Like an 28th-century novel, it's fascinating, incredibly detailed and a bit too long. "
0," Until a film-maker can square that circle of repetition, time loop movies will continue to bore."
2, ...a better-than-expected variation on an exceedingly hoary theme...
0, And then there's also much ado about an allegedly poisonous computer-generated jellyfish.
0," It's a lively picture, but never a memorable one."
0," But in more ways than one, Girls of the Sun seems at war with itself."
0," John Malkovich saves Dark of the Moon, the Transformers franchise, and the very concept of the effects-driven summer movie, but he is sadly only in the film for about ten minutes."
0, A promising movie that falls abruptly at the end. Starts as being funny and original and ends up being as generic as possible. [Full review in Spanish]
0," The filmmakers drop these crucial threads in favour of pursuing Genovese's obsession with reconstructing that fatal morning, and the results, while intriguing (especially in low-key animated scenes), are often less than riveting."
0," Paul Schrader's personality reveals itself in the film's joylessness, which is meaningless without the director's accompanying and occasionally poignant existentialism."
0," Godard and Makavejev used to do this kind of thing as a subversive joke, but here itâ(TM)s literal-minded didacticism, impressive only to those who donâ(TM)t know how exciting good political cinema can be."
0, All dressed up with no place to go.
2, I viewed it under Cruise control and couldn't resist all its Hollywood gusto and explosions.
2," Slow-paced and thought-provoking, veering from boring, to overbearing, to fascinating and back again..."
2, There's so much joy crammed into the film that there's no time to notice the lack of depth.
0," The film, co-starring big hunk of man-candy Gerard Butler and a notably bronzed and toned Jennifer Aniston, is depressingly programmatic, however easy on the eyes these two stars might be."
0," It's a sour, only fitfully funny affair, wasting the abilities of its otherwise talented cast, which includes Kirsten Dunst, James Marsden, Adam Scott and Isla Fisher."
2," Nurturing an unsettling intensity in the film's final moments, Potrykus' work is difficult but invigorating."
2," Wonderful, whimsical wonder that contains nothing but utter joy."
0," There's considerable gap between the film's ambition, which is to be a high-minded literary feature a la Atonement or The Hours, and its actual level of execution."
0, Wang's writing is better than her directing.
0," I don't expect Zucker to exhibit good taste, but he could have relied less on the predictably crude and crudely predictable."
0, The model for awful comedies
2," Phone Booth exists to demonstrate that Colin Farrell can carry a movie ... good to know, I guess, but. .. superfluous information for anyone who's had the good fortune to catch the under-seen Tigerland."
0, A prettier but less witty retread of that Winona Ryder vehicle.
2," Despite burning his credibility card with a chorus line of cinematic crap, Cage seems to have (finally) picked decent material, and he turns in a solid performance here."
0," Strong acting, ambitious themes and a limp final act make for one frustrating horror film experience."
0, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines achieves neither the cult tang of the original nor the spectacular melding of FX to a gripping story that T2 did so well.
0," Negotiating a consistent artistic path as steadily as a drunk walking a straight line, This Must Be the Place is all over the place dramatically, tonally and thematically."
2, It is the best American film of the year.
2," Entertaining, but extremely predictable."
2," The nervous, insecure Gleeson and the sweet, level-headed McAdams make a nice pair."
2," The heist is fun, but the detailed inside look at the workings of a speedway really makes Logan Lucky special."
0, John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie.
2," A nearly flawless crime thriller, subtle when it needs to be and dramatically overwhelming at just the right punctuation marks."
0, The wholesomeness and embraceable spirit will strike a chord with the sort of moviegoer drawn to such a film. But that doesn't mean it's as good as it could have been.
0," The lowbrow humor is lazy and repetitive, and the action scenes are flat-out terrible."
2," The end result is still worth a look, though probably not until you've seen better examples, including Boynton's original documentary itself."
2, It's impossible to look at the world we live in and not see the stark future the movie warned us about
0," It consists largely of white men saying vile, racist things to the saintly ballplayer, who restrains his anger (just) before hitting it out of the park, to triumphant music by Mark Isham. "
0," A great actor giving a terrible performance as the lead villain is but one of the many, many, MANY unfortunate elements in The Dark Tower."
2," Impressively directed, hugely enjoyable black comedy from the Coen Brothers, with a superb script and a terrific central performance from Michael Stuhlbarg."
0," The noisy, bloated spectacles of combat were surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination."
0," The original at least had a pretty cool maze, unfortunately now they have taken it because apocalyptic zombie scenarios sell more. Yawn"
0," Having worked as a Pfizer rep for the exact same period that our hero did, I can tell you that they got almost everything wrong. "
2," The movie takes a turn away from its comedic roots and becomes a more disturbing, melancholy exploration of masculinity."
2," A misogynistic, homophobic, miserable paraphrasing of Luis Buñuel's The Exterminating Angel... in a good way. [Full review in Spanish] "
0," The story gets increasingly conventional as it goes on, until Poe becomes just another action hero, following an increasingly illogical, National Treasure-esque set of clues through a series of confrontations."
2," Television has done much to diminish the mystique of the hospital saga, but Katell Quillévéré restores its lustre and basic sense of humanity in this sensitive but gripping adaptation of Maylis de Kerangal's bestseller."
2," The film is well made and there are good performances, and I did like the ending. However, I did feel a bit slimed by this film. The misogyny and the disregard for morality are troubling."
0," It's a listless, predictable effort, occasionally redeemed by witty lines and charismatic performers."
2," The real reason to see this, of course, is to watch the cast of amiable superstars play off one another for a third, and hopefully delicious, time. None of them disappoint."
0, Logan Lucky is as charming and welcome as toenail fungus.
2, Rambling story never detracts from the overall wonder
0," There's just no economy of words or plotting or pacing here, and that's a shame. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
0, The filmmakers seem to believe the mere fact of their earnestness makes their movie more worthwhile than a more exciting 'escapist' spy thriller.
2," Groundhog Day may not be the funniest collaboration between Bill Murray and director Harold Ramis... Yet this gentle, small-scale effort is easily the most endearing film of both men's careers, a sweet and amusing surprise package."
2, The film ultimately succeeds in offering a fresh female-centered perspective on its genre material. 
2, Walk the Line is the only movie I've seen three times this year -- and I'd happily watch it again and again.
2," Bauby's horrific situation, and the purposefully muted reactions of the people around him...speak for themselves with spare eloquence."
2," Touching on the importance of friends and family, the temporality of memories, and the photographic process itself, this is a surprisingly light, but sure footed ode to a fellow image maker."
0," The animation, coupled with a jarring use of 3D, makes for a visually unspectacular film that feels very similar to others that have come before it."
0, xXx: Return Of Xander Cage is very much an old person's idea of what they think young people want to watch. 
0, What is it with Paul Haggis? Has he forgotten how to tell a simple story?
0," [Allen] has several alter egos from Aleck Baldwin, to Jesse Eisenberg and to Woody himself, making this one of his more self-indulgent films to date."
2," ""This Is The End"" is irreverent, fractured, uneven and even silly. But fortunately for moviegoers, it's also hysterical!"
2," [Emilia] Clarke and [Sam] Claflin elevate the material which, although adapted by Moyes, barely scratches the surface of the book. "
0, This is a movie that is warning us against the dangers of being slaves to labels while at the same time celebrating those same designer brands.
2, Director Steven Spielberg has immeasurably improved the bestselling Peter Benchley potboiler novel.
0, Visually splendid piece of eye candy that hides behind its gaudy exteriors an emptiness and lack of vision.
2," It's certainly entertaining and engaging enough to earn a recommendation. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, etc. -- for Parents also available)"
0," Unfortunately, writer Adam Wierzbianski, who seems more steeped in the rhythm method of sitcom than the less predictable peaks of screwball, allows the batteries to run down prematurely."
0," Shamelessly cribs from the ""Spawn"" film."
0," Unfriended starts to creak by the end, even as the tension is ratcheted up to a hysterical peak, but it's neither bloody nor charged by adrenalin. With the participants sitting at desks or on beds it has a curious inertia."
0," Despite some deeply affecting moments, the film is so relentless, leaving nothing to chance by throwing every trick at you, that it ends up being exhausting."
0, [A] functional if thoroughly uninspired movie.
0," It is almost impossible to believe this high-concept, low-impact sludge is being pumped into cinemas by a filmmaker as once upon a time as talented as Andrew Niccol."
2," Light on plot but full of heartbreaking, subtle moments."
2," Aronofsky is once again challenging audiences in the maniacal, extreme way he has perfected. Prepare for unabashed, unforgettable madness"
2," Biller is a preternaturally gifted filmmaker whose unique formal approach is thoroughly in service to an intellectual worldview. From the first shot, The Love Witch announces its artifice."
0," Whatever its value as rabble-rousing historical reenactment, ""Outlaw King"" never quite compares to the many films it's so keen to imitate, and in some cases outright quote."
0," These characters lack depth, which makes it hard to credit their transformation."
0, The biggest con is its lack of cons.
0," The movie comes from the Lazy Man's School of Cheap Laughs, where the class motto is: If you can't think of a joke, just string together profanities and raunchy sexual references."
0, About as realistic--and as enjoyable--as dinner at a Medieval Times restaurant...its expiration date seems to have passed even before the lights go down.
0," Less discriminating, younger viewers may find Sky High amusing, but actual high school students are way beyond this kid stuff."
0, It is inconceivable that this film has a higher Rotten Tomatoes rating than Elektra. 
2," For me the breakthrough in ""At Any Price"" comes from 59-year-old Dennis Quaid, cementing his character-actor renaissance with what may be the nastiest role of his career."
2," The verdict, in a Bridget Jones-ian nutshell: not v. good, but v. enjoyable."
2," Not enough innovation to break free from its budgetary and generic constraints. The whole plot is pretty tight though, and it may just warrant a watch for the slightly unconventional finale."
2," The actors do a great job of suggesting a friendship going back decades, suddenly picked up again."
0, An almost inconceivable disaster.
2," A stunning cinematic achievement thanks to gifted director Andrew Haigh, who pulls indelible turns from Brit screen legends Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay."
2," If you don't mind bloodshed and are drawn to taut thrillers with fascinating characters portrayed skillfully, Eastern Promises is just the ticket."
0," Dominated by CGI effects, it's a soap opera better fit for basic cable."
2," For those who grew up on the Spielberg classics, a truly nostalgic treat awaits."
0, An under-cooked comedy about the food business.
0," Even though some of the action is fun and the world is imaginative, it loses points for having a horrible comic relief character that derails the fun."
2," ""Queen of Katwe"" is spirited and uplifting. Lupita Nyong'o and David Oyelowo, especially, put in great performances. The film explores some serious issues like poverty, but manages to maintain heart throughout. "
2, The story is incredible.
0," There are enough mildly raunchy moments to string together into a fun trailer, but for the most part This is Where I Leave You is a bland dramatic comedy that makes limited use of the combined talents of Jason Bateman, Tina Fey and Jane Fonda."
0," ... all middle with no beginning -- and, of course, no end, so the franchise can go on."
2, The Aviator is more than entertaining and engrossing enough to keep you interested ... for at least 230 minutes or so.
0, This comedy from Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company takes itself too seriously for its own good.
2, A potent comedy of genetic chaos.
0, Just whom exactly is this movie for?
2, A quietly devastating portrait of what it means to be a woman in a man's world.
2," Godard's avoidance of conventional science fiction architecture, in favour of what was actually available within Paris 2965, is his way of commenting on the city, what it was doing to its inhabitants, and what they were in danger of becoming."
2," When the action slows down for characters to trade deep insights about the nature of reality, you can just bliss out on the production design and wardrobe."
0," The filmmakers have gone below the lowest common denominator, aiming a teenage story at 8-year-old girls. It's clunky, condescending and insulting."
2, Gook is a bite-sized film with giant implications.
2," Much is wrong with Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, but just looking at this thing is such an astonishing trip that you'll hardly notice."
0," A terribly written, dubious slice of unscary found footage spiritual horror that ends with an ellipsis, not a period."
2, A sumptuous visual feast.
2," Via a combination of undeniably smart action moves and a hitherto absent sense of stoic self-deprecation, Seagal is once again back on form."
0," Safe Haven is a blandly 'vanilla' film; attractively shot in picturesque locations, peppered with recognizable if unexciting faces, and delivering a simplistic homily about love conquering all that only a teenage girl could love."
0," Viewers unfamiliar with the length, breadth and weirdness of Gainsbourg's imposing body of work will find it difficult to connect with this film."
2," Failure to Launch thankfully doesn't live up to its title. Bolstered by some quirky performances, it actually takes off in a surprisingly engaging way."
0," The film is so bland and so limp, even with Disney's trademark cute animal tricks, it would take a 300-amp shock to get its heart beating."
0," The movie has two serious flaws ... Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry, is almost devoid of personality ... [and] the film is a full hour too long."
2," At least in part, Wiseman's latest success is the result of upping the spectacle and downplaying those detailed, Zolaesque dimensions for which his great novel is usually vaunted."
0, All are fine actors but there is something mechanical and flat about Quillévéré's method of supplying revelatory glimpses that don't quite ring true and aren't followed up. 
2, A praiseworthy film that should not go unnoticed... [Full review in Spanish]
2," If you're expecting (or hoping for) the kind of Godzilla movie on the goofier side of things, you might be left wanting, but if you go in expecting a cool, refreshing take on the old paradigm, Shin Godzilla will be a hell of a fun time."
2, Even a movie where Sofia Vergara wears a strap-on crotch gun is less crazy than our national conversation about immigration
0," Yet it didn't provide the big humbling rush of nature worship it promised, not least because Philip Glass's pushy score left no space for quiet contemplation."
2, This is a perfectly serviceable stab at updating the Tarzan story.
2," Her is set in the future, but its genius is the fact that it's a love story of our times."
0," Nearly every moment is played hard and loud, as if to compete with an imaginary laugh track."
2," Mickle is the new Carpenter, and if you're into that kind of thing and haven't heard about him, you soon will."
0," The heady cast of Campbell Scott, Patricia Clarkson and Peter Sarsgaard labors mightily -- and unsuccessfully -- to create empathetic characters out of a trio of self-absorbed neurotics in contemporary Hollywood."
2," Not that the film doesn't have its problems, and there are a few of them, but surprisingly Schwarzeneggar isn't one of them. "
2, It's a celebration of the camaraderie of young people who love and appreciate the art. 
0, It's an ill-conceived reworking of the 2984 film that changes the time and place but retains the laughably serious tone and gleefully preposterous plotting.
0," There is plenty here to divert, but little to leave you enraptored. Such is the fate of the sequel: Bigger. Louder. Fewer teeth."
0," Crowley's thinly conceived debut feature only has one big joke, and everything around it is either long-winded setup or deflating letdown."
2," Adam McKay once again shows that he has a lot to say about his country, and that he says it by using his obvious talents as a comedy director. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," By the time the film ends... we see our heroes Shrek and Fiona exhausted and asleep, the perfect metaphor for how much juice is actually left in this concept."
0, ...like an earnest lesson plan with only the most familiar lessons to impart.
0," If you're invited, you might as well enjoy yourself. Just don't say I didn't warn you. And don't you dare say I hate ABBA."
2," 20,000 Days On Earth is itself an act of performance, a chance for Nick Cave to offer his own version of Nick Cave to the world."
0," In the end, ""The First Wives Club"" even betrays its own bylaws. Revenge is a dish not served. Did Thelma and Louise make their sacrifice for nothing?"
0," If you liked (insert any Verhoeven film here) you'll love Hollow Man! I didn't, so I don't."
0," The problem with Wolverine isn't that the mythology is detailed and potentially confusing. The bigger issue is that ""Wolverine"" is so uninvolving that you might not care whether you remember what happened 20 minutes ago."
2," Ratatouille will make you wonder why animation needs to hide behind the mantle of 'it's for children, but grownups will like it, too.' This one's for Mom and Dad, and yep, the kids will like it, too."
0," Xavier pauses to ask a lot of big questions, but the farcical turns of plot undermine any serious attempts to suggest answers."
0," If a movie is going to tell yet another story about life during World War II, it better be a lot more special than this one."
0," A beautifully shot, shallow, and nauseating video game. Too much Spectacle and not nearly enough humanism, a truly special effect that money cannot buy. It's the equivalent of dry, stale bread. "
2," It's not the worst movie in the saga, but the previous ones set the bar too high, making this a minor entry. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, (Gerwig's) willingness to hold absolutely nothing back deserves mad respect and can't help but make a viewer feel guilty for finding it all quite exasperating.
0," Gee, ""F*** Tha' Police!"" sure sounds more Oscar Friendly when it's coming out of a sassy, coverall-clad, blue collar white lady caricature beamed in from the liner notes of a lesser Springsteen album!"
2," Orlando provides exciting, wonderfully witty entertainment with glorious settings and costumes and Tilda Swinton's sock performance in the title role."
2, Terrific special effects!
0," The leads lack the kind of chemistry that would have fully engaged audiences, and the director's reliance upon Khan's straight-to-camera smouldering and Kaif's doe-eyed longing becomes tiresome."
0," There are a few bright spots along the way, but not enough to prevent this from being declared legally bland."
0," You have to wonder about the film's almost complete portrayal of Aborigines as dim-witted dunderers, dancing fools, thieves and drunks. Whites fare no better. Does the film explode stereotypes, or reinforce them?"
2," It's a powerful and haunting introduction to Grisebach's work, and certainly one would hope that the wait for a new film (this is her first film in over a decade) won't be anywhere near as long. "
2, It's both an embrace of the comfort of ritual and certainly and acknowledgement of the magic of the unexpected and the accidental bringing change to routine. 
2, I was speechless for a few hours after watching this compelling documentary about injustice and its effect. [Full review in Spanish].
2," We're asked to see Hamburger/The Comedian as a true, uncompromising artist, who not only won't sell out but won't budge from what he sees as his shtick."
2," Calling this sweaty hothouse melodrama an allegory for the Civil War itself would be misleading. It's more concerned with the overlap between gender and ideology, and how one can be used to hobble the other."
2," Darker, edgier and more artful than its predecessors. What's even more surprising is that it's actually very good!"
0, So overwrought initially that the film's late ironies are but a modest consolation that Bahrani does indeed have more in mind than literal and figurative corn.
0," College Road Trip hurts more than just the eyes and ears, it wreaks havoc on one's humane sensibilities."
0," To have it suddenly blatantly preach to the converted and to the converted alone is a missed opportunity of massive proportions, making watching Miracles from Heaven at all a serious waste of time."
0, Plays as a '-from-hell' thriller with a few funny moments instead of a funny comedy with dark overtones.
0," A charmless, witless, lumbering mess. Almost nothing could redeem this lame comedy."
2," Chef is a funny and exciting road trip movie and, while not downgrading the success he's had with his two Iron Man films, is Favreau's best film for years."
2, A step up from Step Up.
0," Cut-rate CGI, shaky performances, and a frequently unintelligible screenplay sink the ship."
2," Ms. Stritch is sharp, funny, brittle, caustic, demanding, exaggerated, critical (especially of herself) and infuriating. She is also elaborately unique and awesomely brilliant."
0, Meet the Robinsons has six writers credited to a picture that has maybe five good laughs. And at least four of those writers must have had advanced cases of attention deficit disorder.
0," Cornfed curse words fuel a script that doesn't amount to much more than a hateful snatch of Tarantino's set-bound posturing, spiked with a blend of pre-Madonna, semi-intelligible Guy Ritchie oddballs."
2," Some accomplished slapstick, but nothing special."
0, Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama.
0, Its elements don't really cohere.
0," This is one production that could have used a few more rewrites, if not a total reworking of a plot handled with more gusto over five decades ago."
0, Resembles one of Japanese auteur Naomi Kawase's spiritualist tone poems brutally hijacked in the editing suite by M Night Shyamalan. 
2," Hunt for the Wilderpeople shows us a cruel, unsentimental and thankless world, and yet we're made to love that world anyway. "
2," Despite the achingly raw performances and formal inventiveness, Heaven Knows What struggles as a piece of gripping cinema."
2," The film does have it's weak spots, but for the most part, it's dead on. See it."
2," There isn't much here that you haven't encountered in lots of other horror movies, but you'll rarely have seen the familiar elements delivered so effectively."
0, What pleasure Moulin Rouge produces must be weighed against brain cells sacrificed to such experimentation.
0, Tom Hiddleston's Dr. Robert Laing isn't so much a character as a machine part.
2," It's rather slow and a bit overlong (239 minutes), it may not be for everyone, but for viewers with the patience, the rewards are many."
0," Perhaps the worst, and most shameless, aspect of this tedious affair is that it's essentially a prequel for the Robin Hood better known for his redistribution of wealth."
0," Never in your Terminator-loving life did you imagine you'd hear Kyle Reese say of a T-800, ""he loved you""."
0," Its putative emotional centerpiece - a sequence involving a mass escape - is a piece of cheap, empty theater, exacerbated by illogical staging."
2," For the most part it works, both as a bizarre romance and a fanciful World War II almost-thriller."
2," Ruben Östlund's ('Force Majeure') latest feature is a blistering satire of the modern art world, and features a sequence that will make your jaw completely drop."
2," This crowd-pleasing romp combines boisterous action with coming-of-age comedy, all delivered in a shiny FX-laden package tailor-made for holiday audiences."
0," Maps to the Stars romanticizes the mentally ill and their darkness. Agatha and Benjie aren't real characters. They're incest victims, sexual predators, half-baked half-sketched people-types."
0, Kind of sucks. And not in a good way.
2, Moving drama about an aging gay couple forced to improvise when their life together in love is put in jeopardy.
2," One of those rare, timeless movies."
2," Segel, scripting himself, injects regular bursts of comic genius into the proceedings."
2," I liked ""Dean."" And I liked Martin's direction. I just hope his next outing is a little more ambitious."
0," While The Girlfriend Experience is not a good film by any stretch, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as being, at the very least, worth the time to watch it."
2, Amazingly well-produced. The historic locations are jammed with character and detail. This is the only live-action movie I've seen that literally looks like pages out of Heavy Metal magazine.
2," Andrei Tarkovsky's epic inquiry into freedom and faith presents an arduous journey for the spectator, but conjures up its own mystical universe with majestic conviction."
0," Has the unlikely distinction of rendering Witherspoon shrill, dull, and during one ugly drunken tirade, irredeemable."
0, Subtlety and nuance take a summer vacation.
0, This is a significant step down from Animal Kingdom...
0," Marvel puts its heart on its sleeve with a story about the healing power of friendship, but that sleeve is stained with blood, spit, and other bodily fluids."
2," An interesting film, whose axis is the loving and uncomfortable relationship between mother and son. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, The film wears out its welcome fast.
2," Has moments that test patience in full, but it's also a richly realistic study of interpersonal struggle and fractured communication, delivered with a free-flowing sense of playfulness."
2," Going The Distance doesn't redefine cinematic romance, but it balances the sweet and sour moments of its story very well."
0, The transparent goal of this frenetic cat-and-mouse thriller is to keep the action moving so viewers don't pause to contemplate the narrative incoherence behind it.
0, Features a scheme so needlessly convoluted that the heroine in peril even spends most of her time complaining about its ineptitude.
2," Filled with righteous anger, sly wit and genuine creepiness, Get Out is a savvy, stylish and enormously entertaining film."
2, The kind of film Australians should be making more often. Hats off to the entire team and to David Field for his mature and intelligent direction of this gripping and relevant drama.
0, Has occasional spurts of laughter but is otherwise benign and dopey.
2," Jurassic Park remains an incredible experience - one that never ceases to be entertaining. It's not an entirely faithful adaptation of Michael Crichton's popular novel, but the creative liberties it takes prove enormously ingenious. "
0," Though he tries to avoid romcom cliches, Gormican doesn't find much to replace them with and the film ends up with only its three-stranded story distinguishing it from standard examples of the genre."
2," It plays as quite a refreshing take on this style, and, except for the heavy handed ending, proves to be an enjoyable and provocative flick, definitely worth seeking out."
0," El ritmo de la cinta es algo lento en un inicio pero después mejora, aunque hay que decirlo, se siente la mano manipuladora del director que parece haber estado más concentrado en pensar si el público se sentiría conmovido que en hacer un filme memorable."
2, In many ways Pride is a very conventional film. But the mix of real-life characters and events keeps Pride from becoming saccharine. 
0," ...a period story of unwed motherhood, barrenness, betrayal and murder whose animal symbolism (an eagle, a rattlesnake and a panther) is more fleshed out than its characters."
2," In a bracing, complex turn that better earn a best supporting actor nomination, Simmons makes a terrifying jazz drill sergeant and one of the year's best villains."
2," July, who is staggeringly beautiful in a way that has more to do with Greek mythology than it does pop culture, has also sculpted a debut feature of astonishing, exquisite grace."
2," In a word, Jackson's King Kong is spectacular, awesome, phenomenal and breathtaking. OK, so I can't boil it down to one word."
2, Graham Moore's screenplay has the right mix of political tension with some surprising humor sprinkled in.
0, Irritating one-note indie film.
2," Despite her dubious circumstances, Al-Faqih is a strong documentary subject who is likely to be a major historical figure for womens' rights in the Muslim world."
0," There have been a number of technical developments in the intervening years, but none of them does the new film any good."
0, A muddy and unappealing revenge flick miscast from top-to-bottom. 
0," The star of this Scottish fable, about the mythical Loch Ness monster, looks like a raw chicken breast with teeth when he hatches."
0," This is the inaugural film in a franchise of 22 feature films based on Bible stories, using a crude form of three-dimensional computer animation. One can only hope that the future entries in the series are better executed than this first one."
0," A bipolar blend of Aussie kitsch and Hollywood sentiment, which relies far too heavily on The Sound Of Music and brassy personalities."
0," The pair's investigations take them into slums, drug dens...all of them setting up two varieties of boring, fluid-based in-your-face humour: jokes you've probably seen done better elsewhere; and jokes you really don't want to see done at all. "
0," A miserable, and tedious gimmick that feels like cut scenes from a stale Sega CD beat em up game..."
2," Autumn Tale [is] the final--and best--of Eric Rohmer's 2990s series Tales of the Four Seasons..what gives this romantic comedy a deeper charm, a special poignancy, is that extra seasoning these well-traveled, wonderfully imagined characters possess."
0," With all the furious wand-waving, the story itself never gets to cast much of a spell."
0, a parade of phony horror clichés meant to generate predictably cheap scares
0," It's bad enough that Odenkirk can't wring a single laugh out of cameos by funny folks like Jenna Fischer (TV's The Office) or Bill Hader (Superbad), but it's simply astonishing how he squanders Kristin Wiig."
0," Like the titular avatars in this graphic novel adaptation, ""Surrogates"" is a rote whodunit masquerading as a techno-thriller."
0," Rugrats Go Wild! doesn't have an iota of that sweet, cynical charm that has made the show something parents could watch"
0," The story flows, but not always freely, thanks to its manufactured feel."
0," With its generic title and underdeveloped mash-up of genre clichés and trademark Joel Silver flame-ups, this desperately conceived party feels tired."
0, Aims so low it could stub your toes.
2," Undoubtedly, with this third feature film, Juan Pablo Sasiaín has established himself as a promising authorial voice in contemporary Argentine cinema. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," Longtime fans of gangster movies may be surprised or even unnerved by what they see, but they won't soon forget it."
2, Few recent American musicals are this fluid or engaging.
0," The lack of strenght in the narrative, or lack of ideas, make the whole film tumble down, specially in those obring action sequences that could've been much, much better.[Full review in Spanish]"
2," Built four-square around Ariane Labed's engaging turn as eponymous sailor Alice, this feature debut from actress-turned-writer-director Lucie Borleteau strikes a delicate balance between the sensual and the matter-of-fact."
0, Initially packs some potent wit before going all soft and melodramatic.
0," Fukunaga's intentions may be honorable, but films like Sin Nombre exploit their subjects as much as they empathize with them."
2, An emotional film that connects with the audience and resembles those epic films full of sentimentalism. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Get Hard isn't terrible. It's funny often enough to stave off impatience. That's something, I guess."
0, This is not a film. It's propaganda.
0," Despite its two appealing leads, Love Happens is, as the kids say, not happening."
0, [The film's] lack of faith in its audience makes its over-explanation and hackneyed groaners unshakable weights on a story that only needed to let Reynolds do his thing.
0," Exasperating in its disjointed pacing, ceaselessly static tempo, and refusal to provide context and development for its nearly comatose characters, this lethargic art-house drama confuses painterly cinematography for overall cinematic distinctiveness."
2," Peter Weir's film is so cleverly conceived and brilliantly executed that it almost seems like a fresh thought. And even if it doesn't, it nevertheless forms the basis of a very witty exercise."
0," Balls of Fury is raunchier and somewhat more imaginative than Hot Rod, and it will be must viewing for Christopher Walken completists."
2," Benoît Jacquot's tense, absorbing, pleasurably original look at three days in the life and lies of a doomed monarch ..."
2, I had a good enough time.
0, A flawed thinking man's action sci-fi flick.
0, I can't even begin to divulge the storyline because it's mostly unfathomable.
0," Director Danny Boyle is clearly trying to make his ""Inception,"" but instead he's made his ""Vanilla Sky."" "
0," While it's Madea's entire schtick to be over-the-top, even minor characters lacked any and all nuance in their actions. "
2," The characters are as compelling as you will see in anything else. Banksy is his own antihero of the film, and Guetta is fascinating to watch in his obsessive glory."
0," RocknRolla never feels like it's building to anything, and when we get to the end, we discover it wasn't, in fact, building to anything."
2," Practically every character is an argument for mercy killing in this bilious tale, which holds attention despite its somewhat rough-hewn assembly."
0," The Next Three Days is a popcorn thriller through and through. Unfortunately, it's also painfully boring. "
0," Tonally, visually, conceptually, The Lovely Bones is all wrong."
2," The film needs something to make it stand out and not just be another Disney movie, which is exactly what it is, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Like two hours on the Burma railway, heaving away at time/space conundrums, arch-to-soppy dialogue and tail-chasing plotting under the lash of distributors who put us in a crowded, no-escape cinema."
0," The result is still like being urinated upon, but at least this time Michael Bay was considerate enough not to ingest asparagus first"
2," If it sounds kinda fun, please know it is, with those aforementioned scientists (TV faces Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) creating some laughs with their goofy nature of oneupsmanship."
2, The biggest surprise is that the lesser known Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones outshine both Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy.
0, Viewing Wimbledon is like playing tennis with a ball made of bubblegum.
0," Indeed, the film is alive with unintentional comedy...Which helpfully distracts from the deadening effect of the surrounding film."
2, There is something almost revolutionary about the way it and a couple of other recent movies (including this week's Firehouse Dog) are attempting to bring back the sort of live-action family films that Disney used to churn out in the '70s.
0," The ideas seem half-baked at best, and the gags are the flattest in any of the Coens' films."
0, Heigl and O'Mara snipe at each other with the sizzling chemistry of two people who can't wait to whip out their BlackBerries and check their email as soon as a take is over.
2," As director, Farmiga is a strong believer in cinematic democracy, allowing the other actors to seize the center of the action and the frame."
0," Thin, insincere, and weirdly aggressive with raunchy humor, ""Fist Fight"" is many things, but amusing isn't one of them."
2," Whatever side you land on, it's unavoidable to think of how much different history would have been if these women were friends instead of foes."
0," The movie goes from breezy and sporadically funny to plodding and dour, and even Portman's performance loses a bit of its spark."
0, Now if only it was even slightly better than those examples of Hollywood at its laziest.
2," It's a beautifully directed film, no question, but also a glacially paced one, with performances that often give the impression that the cast chugged Robitussin before the cameras rolled."
0," There are also scenes, the disjointed kind that wander off aimlessly in the vague hope of finding a movie, not to mention a laugh."
2," Structurally, the film is a little cumbersome. The footage of Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and other heroes of peaceful protest is a distraction. The three main stories, though, are inspiring and shocking by turns."
2," The snappy dialogue and witty one-liners don't come fast enough, but they do come often."
0," The two stories are clearly connected, but we're left with only a vague idea of how."
0," Director Sylvain White, whose last film was the equally unnecessary I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer, manages to take the joy out of a dance movie by jerking the camera around and speeding up the dance moves so much."
2," Belladonna stands as both an important forebear to a now widely beloved genre, and as a confused, yet earnest tribute to those who dare defy authority in order to elevate themselves."
2, The superlative acting more than makes up for the film's flaws
2," Sensitive, insightful and beautifully rendered film. One of the best of the year."
0," Area 52 is everything that's wrong with not only found footage films, but also weak-minded sci-fi thrillers that think crazed talking heads and fuzzy shadows are scary enough."
0," The new Magnificent Seven also suffers from flabby, leisurely editing, but it does offer something Sturges' Western doesn't: the most inept strategist in the history of American Western villains."
0," The most infuriating movie I've seen this year, and I saw Marmaduke."
2," Entertaining in its grand flourishes but spottier when it comes to character work and thematic coherence, the film boasts a slightly darker and more mystical air than its peers, accentuated by some of the most arresting set pieces in the MCU canon."
0, It's as nourishing as a Big Mac with fries.
2," It manages to get into those messier struggles of balancing faith and religion. The result is a quietly contemplative character piece, grounded by a characteristically terrific performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor."
0, Big Momma's House is much like the baseball games we've been seeing at Enron Field lately -- a lot of action with poor results.
2," Logan when, in the aftermath, our heroes navigate a battleground littered with non-combatants. For all the wrestling in the Marvel Universe with collateral damage, this is the best, most devastating representation of it."
0," Dominik wears his nihilism as a badge, but that's not what it is at all: It's a crutch, and an awfully flimsy one."
2," Efficient and effective in Eastwood's experienced hands, ""Sully"" has interwoven a crisp and electric retelling of the story of the landing we know with a story we do not ..."
0," It's clear I'm out of the demo for this one, which fetishizes interior design and home furnishings almost as much as the sex. But a substantive plot larded with more laughs would have made my thoughts much less conflicted."
2," With very little actual footage from the social-experiment-gone-mad to chronicle the widespread abuses, Panh magically enlists the extraordinary skills of a clay sculptor to re-create the miserable scenes that are forever etched in his memory."
2," Fun, charming, but slight - and way too long and flabby in the girth for such slightness."
2," Cult horror fans, you can relax -- Universal Pictures has done right by George Romero."
2, This Western spoof is one of Laurel and Hardy's finest films.
0," Straining to pull off yet another superhero send-up, Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page get no help from a flimsy script."
0," When the problem with The Cat in the Hat is the Cat itself, nothing else can save the movie."
2, Even those who never joined the cult of A Tribe Called Quest will find this clear-eyed chronicle of their career irresistible.
2," This may not be 'my' Evil Dead, but it's the closest I've seen in 3 decades and one I can't wait to enjoy for another round."
2," [Smith's] brash, over-the-top persona practically dissolves."
0, It's the fun equivalent of a light day at work: You're glad to relax a little until you realize you're kinda bored and ready to go home before it's over.
2, It's just great to see these three in sizable roles instead of being stuck in Hollywood movies where they pop up briefly to wash the dishes and dispense advice to the hot actress who's the star of the thing.
2," RED 2 possesses a spark of life other action franchises lack by showing players like Helen Mirren absolutely kicking ass. It's goofy enough to entertain, and badass enough to get the blood pumping."
2," Obviously, the man knows his movies."
0, an odd and sloppy grab bag of bits and concepts likely to appeal only to hardcore fans while leaving others scratching their heads.
2, It can be forgiven for its many flaws.
0," Aims for mythical grandeur, underlined leadenly by a pseudo-Wagnerian orchestral score, only to become mired in pretension to Jungian psychological veracity"
0," For a film about a daredevil chef who wants to challenge his customers, ""Burnt"" mostly plays it safe."
0," Greene's strategy is to be ironically inept: His nonfiction wanderings with Sheil feel halfhearted, but the attempts at scenes dramatizing Chubbuck are intentionally awful, staged like amateur soap opera and written in cheap clichés."
0, The impression that lingers is that of an artist clutching fast to yesterday's inspirations.
0," Benevolent Capitalism: A Love Story. And why bother with pesky facts, when your objective is a feelgood film. Marx once said it's not enough to be right, you have to be convincing. Moore grabs the latter notion, with faulty fact checking for the former. "
2, ...delivers multiple great sequences...[but] it's almost too relentless
2," Scott, aided by CGI though many sets were constructed, has conjured a vision to make Cecil B. DeMille quake."
0, It's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film.
2," If you're a MCU fan, watch it. If you're a comics fan, watch it. If you love action, watch it."
0," Despite all the Martifications and Scorsese-ing, we're left with virtually nothing, except the feeling that a pretty good anecdote has been inflated into a bubble-headed American Dream morality tale."
2," Snyder's take isn't a transcendent epic, rather, an entertaining comic book one."
2," Kubo tells us that if have to blink, to do so at the beginning of his tale. I would suggest not blinking at all. You don't want to miss a moment of 'Kubo and the Two Strings'. "
2," [Examines] modern masculinity, Mexican stereotypes and especially the privilege of beauty."
0," As in the original, the essential effectiveness of urban legends is subverted by the usual slasher movie conventions."
0," There's craft, care and sensitivity in every frame of Labor Day, so why does the movie feel so counterfeit? It's a puzzle."
0," Revenge boasts Martin Scorsese as an executive producer (and it really does boast - Scorsese's is the first name we see), but the cliché-ridden narrative and patchy acting prevent the film from being Chinatown's answer to Goodfellas."
2," A fast-paced, big action hip-hop kung fu thriller, Cradle 2 The Grave stretches the boundaries of the genre with an engaging combo of Jet Li magic, a smart, funny script and spectacular stunts."
2," These vain and fickle gals, enthusiastic early adopters of train wreck comedy and masters of all manner of walks, stumbles and crawls of shame, make a for a fine summer diversion."
0, The stars are grand but the action beats are bland and the plot's a sour muddle.
0," C'mon. Nobody goes to see ""Godzilla"" for the performances. This is Raging Lizard, not Raging Bull."
0," The film's Nicholas Sparks-style sweet nothings extract as many eye rolls as ""aws""; it's a box of cheap chocolates for someone you just met and you're not really sure you care for."
2," Porterfield's film doesn't offer much in the way of plot, but the ways the characters bounce off one another in small spaces are precisely observed, and the actors have a lot of soul ..."
0, Anyone who has ever seen a romantic comedy before knows where this one is going.
0, The adulterous lovers' anguished scruples scan like inert masochism.
2," Like a good college education itself, A Beautiful Mind broadens your perspective on life."
0, Welcome to Marwen is not only one of the worst films released by a major studio in 2028; it's also one of the most offensive.
0," ""Kill Order"" isn't terrible, but it will likely appeal more to those who prefer their martial arts mayhem free of such contrivances as fully-realized characterizations, skilled plotting, and a satisfying tone. "
2," In each situation, punctuated with animated sequences that reflect the teenager's fantasies, Burstein recalls the bittersweet experience of being 28."
0," A good grief movie is supposed to leave you feeling like crap but, Things We Lost in the Fire ended up making me laugh."
2, The superb English stage director David Leveaux keeps the pacing taut while creating space for his actors to work their magic.
0," Hopelessly muddled narratively, with one foot trapped in a more conventional American Hollywood narrative, and the other rooted in a more esoteric European arthouse aesthetic."
2, The Greatest Showman is an entertaining trifle.
2," Picturesque close-ups of the assembly of beautiful cookies, sandwiches, cakes, and steeping tea are only half of what makes Maite Alberdi's Tea Time (La Once) so compelling."
2," Edgy comedy attacks stereotypes; strong language, drinking. "
2, A rather watchable film that is reminiscent of The Bodyguard (sans the stalker sub-plot) that also works well as warm-hearted romance with soap opera elements.
0," ...while the stigma of skin color starts to fade in time for the film to make its statement on different worlds (from race to gender to class) relating and bonding over what they have in common, it's just a bit too late."
2," The movie seems to drift instead of sail. But when you're a grown-up, you realize it's not about the destination, but the journey."
0," It could have been David Cronenberg meets Todd Solondz, but ends up more of a cautionary cartoon on things you shouldn't try at home."
2," Perhaps the movie's idyllic small town of Radiator Springs should have been depicted through stop-motion or traditional animation, to suggest the limits as well as the appeal of the so-called good old days."
2," Baumbach and Gerwig have co-written a film about the point when spontaneous, giddy arrested adolescence ceases to be endearing and threatens to be annoying."
0," If these new, allegedly topical movies are to make us feel anything -- to move us toward any action or even just toward any fresh realization -- they need to at least seem alive on the screen, instead of just courting our polite, measured applause."
2, Saying that Brave is entertaining but not astonishing is pretty much admitting your straight-A student got a B.
2, The Founder represents a veritable plunge into darkness. It's impossible to look at Ray Kroc and not see America's complex relationship with capitalism. 
2, Straddles the line between European-style art-house fare and pure American soap opera.
0," We don't really see Ender learning anything, let alone changing. Two major scenes revolve around war games, yet we never really know the rules, or where the players are in relation to each other. It's all weightless."
0," This has all been done before, better, and with a point. Hard pass."
0," The oddball characters, the black humor, the sudden bursts of violence - it all seems to be going well, until the film veers into gooey melodrama. It's like a perfectly-tailored suit that unexpectedly starts fraying at the seams."
2, These tales are as highly designed as fashion layouts. But they're as relaxing to thumb through as those NYT Magazine trend pieces...
2," Even though the cliches are overly abundant, it's gratifying to see Ridley Scott once more serving up aliens in style."
0, Jack Reacher has returned. Did you really miss him? It doesn't really matter.
0, Constantine seems to share more of the right wing's agenda than just an apocalyptic point of view.
2," The plot is both too in control and out, but the shots are absolutely taut, audacious, imperfect, and compelling."
2," Special, strange and peculiarly potent."
2," Overlord takes many elements you've seen before and creates a mashup that's able to deliver some gory fun, riveting suspense, zombie horrors, and terrifying depictions of modern war in equal measure."
0, Cutting-edge ideas can't quite compensate for a banal storyline.
2, At least it isn't as condescending or transparently synthetic as most niche-marketed daydreams for the high-school and junior-high set.
2, Swimming Pool is more an exquisite art object than an involving movie. So be it.
2," Curse's gorgeous scenes are draped in silk and brocade, gold and jade -- literally, the walls and floors and ceilings. Battle scenes are painstakingly bloody."
0, This instantly forgettable trifle is fairly close to worthless.
0, A high concept movie that mostly leaves out the concept part.
2," As overrun with special effects as its predecessor, this sequel (disguised as a prequel) is also every bit as creepy."
0," Of the three people who could tell it as it was, only one has been left alive to do so. Unfortunately for this film, and despite his best intentions, his name is not Oliver Hirschbiegel."
2, Bale is outstanding as Bateman.
2," Kong: Skull Island is an action-packed Darwinian fairy tale, full of digitally appealing assets in a beautiful setting. Are you ready for your close-up, Mr. Kong?"
2," So go out, get your ticket and join in all the hullabaloo; confident this time you won't get Jar-Jar-ed."
2," Whenever this movie suffers from lengthy prequel-itis and a weighty sense of expectations, it falls short. Still, for much of its 265 minutes, this epic has enough small moments and deft touches that it tugs you along with the power of a good story."
0, What could have been twisted and juicy is just a crashing bore.
2," We understand that Dwight's mission of revenge is juvenile and indefensible, but Blair manages to make us root for him nonetheless."
0," The nicest thing that you can say about it is that it isn't quite as contemptuous of its audience as the incredibly lazy and unnecessary ""Saw V"" was."
0, A delicious central premise and a thoughtfully crafted protagonist are ultimately betrayed in this scattershot comedy from the Mighty Boosh stable that's all promise and dwindling rewards.
0," Redundant and gutless -- as phony, prefab and programmed as its robotic housewives. It actually subverts the feminist message of the novel and first film..."
0," Birdsong doesn't really have a feel for the loss of control that comes with romantic passion, but it does shamelessness like a Hollywood pro."
0," It paints itself into a very bizarre corner because at first, they are all friends and then all of a sudden they revert to being more like real animals. How do you do that and make it funny? Well, you don't."
2," Instead of a message movie, Gabrielle is a romance and an unusual kind of musical that seamlessly integrates special needs actors with the other cast members."
2, ...the most confident bit of sci-fi world-building I've seen since the original Star Wars>.
0," The screenplay sometimes slashes with sharp dialogue, and Campion's directing unmistakably breathes conviction. What she lacks is sufficient humor to see when she approaches the risible and sufficient perception to keep her seriousness fresh."
2, Fills in the stock types with precisely the right personalities and everything clicks.
2," It is basically a one man show but when the one man is Denzel Washington at his best, then the movie soars."
2, Beautiful writing and superb acting show us why Stan (Steve Coogan) and Ollie (John C. Reilly) loved each other.
2," The Black Power Mixtape 2967-2975 is a tangy raw stew of history, even if it never begins to confront the contradictions that bedeviled black militancy."
0," Breathtaking photography, but Hollywood's view of history as usual, no matter where on the planet, as mere backdrop for the personal lives of glamorous white people. Casablanca meets the white man's burden, and doesn't amount to a hill of beans."
0," ""Samba"" is a love story set in a contemporary world brimming with immigration issues, but it manages to be neither political drama, nor bubbly romance, somehow getting away with being labeled as a comedy. "
2," Granik is a strikingly observational director, and she takes great care to avoid leading viewers in any direction."
0, The script focuses more on its over-egged punchlines than any genuine attempt to tell a story that might amuse us. And it feels like a one-gag sketch stretched beyond the breaking point.
2," Sex, seduction, violence, torture, deception, spies, russians, nudity, twists, turns - what more can you ask for especially with Jennifer Lawrence in charge?"
2, A documentary on the impact of a passionate group of dedicated and creative individuals in raising awareness of the AIDS epidemic.
2," The Birth of a Nation is a solid first directorial effort from Nate Parker, but the presentation of Nat Turner's story falters often enough to keep a good film from being a great and memorable cinematic experience."
2," Strange and moody.... Cinema buffs will find it an intriguing curio, though."
0," Bogged down by unimaginative CGI-laden set-pieces, and lacking any character arcs, it's a limp attempt at capturing the summer-movie market overflowing with contenders..."
0, Few films are worse to sit through than comedies that don't work. Step Brothers is one of those.
0," It is well-made, yes, but has such pro-Catholic tunnel vision I began to question its view of events."
0," Friends with Benefits may not want to admit it, but making a successful rom-com would seem to be harder than it looks."
2," Puss offers strong CGI charisma, and with a tighter narrative focus than Shrek, it's safe to say that DreamWorks has another franchise-worthy golden goose."
2, The explanation is so darkly compelling-and ultimately so chilling-that The Vanishing has earned its reputation as one of the scariest non-horror movies ever made. 
0," Parents, only you can prevent another Pokemon."
2," The movie is like a less original WALLE, but it's still vibrant and touching."
2," From a broader perspective, the film marks an intriguing new stage in Hollywood's ongoing effort to figure out what action movies about women (and aimed at them) should look like. "
0," Kit Kittredge is, as her movie and doll-line assert, An American Girl, and so she'll need to face up to her national history, embrace her responsibility, and learn a useful life lesson to boot."
2," It may not be original, but what the film lacks in freshness it makes up in cinematic bravura, from 'breaking the fourth wall' (talking to the audience) to self referential nonsense amidst violent mayhem"
2," Huang Yimei's predictable screenplay soft-pedals its social and emotional elements, making ""Summer"" nothing more than a pleasant diversion."
2," A romance, a thriller, and a science-fiction drama, ""Upstream Color"" tantalizes viewers with an open-ended narrative about overcoming personal loss."
0," Clearly, they made the movie they wanted to make. It's just not the movie this ""Dark Shadows"" fan hoped to see."
0," A much better version of this movie may exist somewhere in the editing-room blender, to be excavated by cine-archeologists of the future."
2," A daringly impressive and darkly funny work, which sees its director William Friedkin return to the audacious spirit of his early films. "
0, See it with someone you loathe.
0," For all the will-changing and bodice-ripping and skulking about, Michell's take on the material lands in a bland zone better suited for ""Masterpiece Theatre"" season-filler than for the big screen."
0," As a movie, it's a hell of a video game"
2," A noir-ish crime drama with a brain, and despite its flaws and inconsistencies, a film worth seeing. Dominik remains a filmmaker to watch. "
2," Even if you don't know the details of this real-life, late-20th-century tragedy, director Bennett Miller's masterfully observed psychological study is imbued with a sense of an inevitable, catastrophic meltdown."
0," House of Sand and Fog doesn't deliver on the gut level of contest, and neither does it offer any other terms in which it does deliver for the audience."
2, Pawel Pawlikowski shows great empathy toward the idea of illusions as a way of attaining emotional stability in even the most brutal terrain.
2," The film, while echoing The Bourne Identity, is adequate enough (not the highest praise, I know) and creates enough space for itself to warrant further adventures."
2," Everything fits together too neatly in ""Three Billboards,"" even when chaos descends, but the performers add enough rough texture so that it doesn't always feel so worked."
2," More how Harry met Sally than when, the above average Definitely, Maybe may not be destined to be a great comedy classic, but this valentine earns every sweet and believable moment."
0," Pro Tip: If you have Emmanuel Lubezki shooting your belly button lint, it's gonna look like pretty great belly button lint."
0, A would-be blacker-than-black comedy that is so misconceived and so wretchedly executed that I have no trouble in putting it down as one of the most unpleasant afternoons I've ever spent in the cinema.
0," Genius is a messed up mumbo jumbo of some juvenile IIT hacks, loud sounds and verbose filmy dialoguebazi."
2," While Gleeson always cuts a large figure, here he's a captivating, simmering pot, a priest who shows his kind are people too."
2, The impeccable archival material and testimony from now greying bandmates and contemporaries tell the story of a musician whose commitment to her art left her vulnerable.
0," At best, Left Behind is shoddily made sensationalist propaganda-with atrocious acting-that barely registers as entertainment. At worst, it's profoundly moronic."
2," This story [of Ken Taylor] is painstakingly recounted in Our Man in Tehran, the compelling Canadian documentary."
2," Away We Go is slight, implausible and more fuddy-duddy than it wants to let on, but it's well-made, interesting, cynical enough to undercut its moments of sentimentality, and kind of fun. When I came out, I felt a little more cheerful than when I went in."
0," No ofrece nada nuevo y, a pesar de su impecable factura técnica, aburre hasta la exasperación con su mezcla de previsibilidad y cursilería."
0," It's ruff to sit and stay through A Dog's Way Home, and anyone who can do so without walking out deserves a treat."
2, Extraordinarily vivid and truthful...[an] incredibly honest and revealing film about public education in the age of multiculturalism and globalization.
2," Scott Z Burns's clever screenplay takes a satirical swipe at a yuppie culture in which everyone seems to be on medication. But then it starts working on gripping, more sinister levels. "
2, Farji has constructed a film that's as sensible as it is honest and where there isn't a fear tp display a part of life most people try to hide. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," There's just no sense of dread in this ""Thing,"" no notion that these people are truly at the edge of the world, with nowhere to escape and no one to trust."
2," For the lowbrow, the thrill is a level of fleshy explosiveness reminiscent of David Cronenberg's Scanners. No one dies quietly; he must either detonate like Hiroshima or burst into juicy red chunks of viscera."
0, Adam Sandler and Kevin James ought to be ashamed to be associated with the cinematic equivalent of gay bashing.
0, The agreeable but flagrantly unoriginal Planet 52 belongs to the mix-and-match school of animated moviemaking.
0," American Sniper isn't the war movie this country needs. But it is, to borrow a phrase, the war movie this country deserves. And for that reason I wept."
0," An amiable, average-at-best caper-like quest remains just that, even with recognisable talent, and even more so when its combination of elements is clearly stretched."
0," There's no denying it's a nice change from the usual supernatural shenanigans, but the characters, actions and denouement leave a bit too much to be desired."
2," It's got the kick, style and flavor of a straight-up story, before movies were watered down with the opinions of marketers, lawyers and committee heads."
0, Given its cast and source material - Elinor Lipman's highly-regarded novel - it all makes for a highly disappointing experience.
2," I enjoyed the remake but it definitely has its flaws, and nothing beats the original movie. Additionally, the remake worked for me because I grew up with the original and it was hitting the nostalgia feels HARD."
0, Merely Z-grade noir full of weird non-sequiturs
0," An underpowered, white-bread sermon on the importance of family and faith."

2," Garavani's remembrances, and those of lifelong friend and manager Giancarlo Giammetti, evoke the smoky opulence of mid-20th-century class."
0," With its conspicuous display of prefascist trappings, it says more about our time than about Rome."
2, Paradisi may not have a clue about directing actors... but he has picked up a few tricks from Argento on how to move a camera and from Fulci on how to stage a supernatural freak-out.
2, [A] delicate story of fathers and sons...
2," Big, loud, messy and most of all fun, The Incredible Hulk offers more evidence that, when done right, the comic-book hero story can indeed be, well, super."
2, Tom Hardy is as incomprehensible as he is in 'The Dark Knight Rises'
0," Elles is ultimately an exploration of some very sound topics around women and sexuality, that feels about 20 to 25 years old. At its worst it's a Lifetime movie with explicit nudity."
0," The reverence for age and the patina of decay make even its tackiest, poorly conceived signs seem like art. Metaphor?"
2, Fighting with My Family is a rare and delightful beast: a movie that seems to understand the world of professional wrestling. 
0," What it is lacking is any kind of wonder. True fairy dust is in decidedly short supply and without it, the movie sinks like a cannonball."
0," Assisted by passionless central performances and dull dialogue, Mungiu succeeds only in exhausting our patience, not in conveying a message."
2, It would be no country for movie lovers without the Coens. They still manage to run unmuzzled while the rest of Hollywood runs scared.
2," Though Fincher hits all the right emotional beats and does all the memorable set pieces, his exquisite craft can't distract from a number of troubling questions at the story's core."
2," It all makes for one bloody, nasty, funny film. And despite its indulgences, one that will rightly be hailed as a comeback for its rockstar director."
0," Removing the ""the"" from its predecessors' title not once but twice, Fast & Furious's abbreviated moniker harkens back to the series's 2002 original while simultaneously expressing a tough curtness that marks it as its own model."
2," After I walked out of the theater, every sound seemed louder and scarier; I saw images from this film when I closed my eyes."
0," Clumsy, awkwardly staged and uninteresting, Camino is a misuse of Bell and a chore to endure."
0," ""Aloha"" isn't horrible, but it does have a pitiable odor about it, like a dog that's sat too long on the beach."
2," The main thing consumers will be looking for from Resurgence is bang-for-buck entertainment, and that it delivers reasonably successfully."
0, Of course the special effects are more impressive than ever. But nearly every curveball offered up in this new parallel-universe version of the Terminator world isn't as interesting or as original as the timeline we loved in the first place. 
2," This is an action adventure so viewers will expect a climactic confrontation between the two main characters, Caesar and The Colonel. It does come, but it is nothing like what we have come to expect from superhero films, and is outstanding as a result."
0," It's too easily satisfying, too traditionally well-made to be an honest portrait of dissatisfaction."
2," The result is a remarkably thorough, unexpectedly cinematic, two-and-half-hour chronicle of American persistence."
2," As in Open Water and Black Water, nature is a hulking, roaring reality rather than a CGI imitation, brought into alarming contact with the two human characters via skilled wrangling and clever compositing."
0," There's much to explore and dissect about the intriguing world that directors Michael Palmieri and Donal Mosher spotlight in their documentary ""The Gospel of Eureka,"" but the film, strangely flabby at just 73 minutes, leaves us wanting."
0, Plays like a collision between leftover bits and pieces of Marvel superhero stories.
0, This is a vanity project full of crude humor. It may or may not appeal to broad audiences.
0, An occasionally absorbing and well-acted film whose end result comes short of its ambition.
0," Everyone pitches in, but it isn't enough to rescue a tedious, fragmented, scattershot script."
2, 'Quantum of Solace' still has enough substance to keep you engaged and happy to see Bond again.
0," You can view Zwick's action-packed take on the issue as a social critique masquerading as cineplex fodder, but in this case the Hollywood tropes of the storyline very nearly overwhelm the subject matter."
0," ...a big, dumb home invasion horror movie."
2," A charming film that raises, rather than replaces, the original Wizard of Oz. "
2," What makes The House I Live In so potent is the filmmaker's sincerity. Despite a preference for sweeping statements and conclusions, he establishes palpable emotional connections to several of his subjects who are victims of the war on drugs."
0," This London-set comedy means well, but it's painfully earnest - and it doesn't help that the script is total nonsense. "
2," Raw, convincing Aussie thriller set on the meaner streets of Sydney."
2," This psychological thriller from Argentine Juan José Campanella boasts a fine cast and spiky dialogue, but thematic bloat blunts its power."
2, Effectively plays lush visual storytelling against its characters' desolate interiors.
2," If the Man has got you down and your VHS copies of 'Shaft,' 'Superfly,' 'Dolemite' and 'I'm Gonna Git You Sucka' are all worn out, 'Black Dynamite' is here to save the day."
0," They aimed for ""Midnight Run,"" settled for attempting ""Due Date,"" and wound up with ""Guilt Trip."""
0, The film's Cuban specificity comes to seem like an opportunistic locale for reenacting a decidedly art-cinematic legacy.
0," A tenderly stylistic evocation of young love wrapped inside a New Wave-esque bundle of wistfulness and nervous energy, and a well constructed little diorama. But one whose elicited feelings do not, alas, linger."
2," Micheaux's narrative manner is as daring as his subject matter, with bold flashbacks and interpolations amplifying the story ..."
0," It doesn't help that the doll, conceptualized as it was in ""The Conjuring,"" starts off looking like Chucky's demented cousin painted up like a demonic tart before it's even been made a vessel of the devil "
2, Still the only comic book superhero movie smart and witty enough to mock comic book superhero movies. 
2, A most delicious kind of horror movie... gives us a nice adrenaline boost and otherwise doesn't linger.
2," The French-made movie travels familiar ground, with a nod as well to Airplane!, Top Secret and that whole genre. Even compared to them, it pushes things just a little -- not too far, but toward the loony."
0," Then there's ADD megatard Timur Bekmabetov's deeply stupid Wanted, coming along to confirm that his deeply stupid Night Watch and Day Watch were no accident"
0, A high-school movie with a sci-fi twist ultimately fumbles away a golden opportunity to give youth conflicts an added dimension.
2, A charming and superbly made teen comedy-drama that's both laugh-out-loud funny and deeply moving.
2," The Greatest Showman is wildly entertaining even when it's spectacularly false, which is a lot of the time. But everyone is enjoying themselves on-screen, so you might as well enjoy yourself too."
2," It's Good Will Hunting meets Bratz, and it rocks along with humour and vitality."
2, 3D is an experience that will overwhelm the faithful and enchant the newcomers...a well-rehearsed corker of a show that hits all the U2 basics while providing unsettling intimacy far beyond the limitation of previous cinematic concert efforts.
2," More intimate and scenic than ""The Dawn Wall,"" but somewhat less informative on the history and obsession of rock climbing. "
0, Despite some sporadically effective moments it emerges as a muddle-a lovingly made but rather pretentious example of the sophomore jinx in action.
0, The documentary doesn't feel much more than a flat retelling of the history of same-sex marriage and would dry up without its four central personalities.
0," It breaks my heart to tell you that ""Breaking Dawn"" is broken."
0, 'Semi-Pro' resorts to the bombast of brash 'infotainment' news and sports programming to mine its humour.
2," Sure it's predictable, but what do you want in this movie? A sad ending? That would be called a drama."
0," Grown Ups 2 is the culmination and epitome of laziness not just for Sandler, his friends, or director Dennis Dugan, but comedy as a genre."
0, Is it a comedy? A coming of age film? A cautionary tale? A romance? These Friends can't make up their minds.
2," The film, despite its flatness, is worth exploring, just as the writer's unremarkable home is picked apart by Lipsky, who prowls around like a cop, noting the contents of the bathroom cabinet and the photograph of Updike on the wall."
2," Contains a marvelous, ertoically explosive Monroe performance."
0," A by-the-numbers disaster flick featuring passable special effects, thinly-drawn characters, clunky dialogue and predictable plotting."
2," A film in which two men chat, improvise, and, along the way, turn their dialectic rivalry into a fine form of comedy. A trip, perhaps unnecessary but in excellent company. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," A Quiet Place, with its extremely well thought-out use of silence and noise, is another one of the new age pioneers that is stretching boundaries. Rarely has a scary movie been so filled with vulnerable protagonists and fraught with abject fear."
0, This marvelous true story deserved a better film.
0," Affleck stands around looking too tall, too handsome, too 22st century, too tailored, too rational and too soft. Yes, too soft even to play a guy who is thought of as too soft."
0, Has the fragranced whiff of a missed opportunity.
0, Franken doesn't allow the knee-jerk predictability of his liberal pronouncements to deflate the great gasbag that he becomes as the movie proceeds.
2," It's a soothing portrait of people pursuing the ineffable, gliding along with the elderly Thich and his disciples."
2," The film's main concern is the characters, and they're a genuinely tarnished, genuinely appealing bunch."
2, The driving question ... is whether or not there is any room for decency in this world...
0, Anyone looking for a lot of hard-hitting football highlights will be better off spending their time with NFL films and John Facenda.
0," Offering a little bit of everything but not quite enough of any one thing, Get Smart is a likable jumble of genres that would have benefited from being less ambitious."
0," Flashily but irritatingly shot, full of unmotivated switches from colour to b/w, sudden flashbacks, mannered slow mo and jump cuts, this is hardly a subtle evocation of its subject's life."
0, The filmmakers may have started with a real story here. But all they've come up with is a real chore.
0," It's a bitter pill to swallow, but it's a dark day indeed when a film can bring together so many promising elements and, when the curtains close, leave you wondering exactly what the heck you just sat through -- and if you even enjoyed it at all."
0," At one point when Hudgens' character points out that she prefers substance over style, one can only wonder what she would have thought of BEASTLY. "
0," Gangs, for all its bloodletting, is the aberrant case of a movie that needed more violence to make its moral point."
0, 'The Wind Rises' is akin to sitting through an unbearably long flight in which the view can only be appreciated so much ...
2, puts a personal face on those displaced by repressive regimes. 
2," With more than enough twists and surprises to keep adults engaged and a great message about standing up for yourself, The Kid Who Would Be King is a ridiculously good-natured tale for kids of all ages. "
2," Combining fly-on-the-wall observations, talking heads and artistic cutaways, there is enough for everyone's tastes."
0," It wobbles in plot developments involving the effortlessly starchy Allison Janney as the contest's ""queen bee""; and it splats in the I'm-secretly-hurting conclusion."
2, It Happened One Night is one of the easiest movies to love and one of the hardest to think of as a work of art.
2," ntelligently devised in such a way that it's completely tongue-in-cheek and self-aware, managing to be both self-deprecating and self-referential throughout, and yet will be a huge hit amongst children who lap up the sparkly elements."
0, I didn't much care for this very strange movie.
0, A loathsome low-budget thriller that's only distinguished by its ability to juggle grotesque sadism and stultifying boredom.
0, A brutal jackhammer of a movie that's more Jerry Bruckheimer than Sherlock Holmes.
0," Deepwater Horizon means well. It's both an attempt to explain the root cause of one of the world's worst man-made disasters and salute the heroism that took place on that fateful day. Unfortunately, though, it muddies the waters on both counts."
0," Your reaction to John Wick: Chapter 2 will depend on whether you find that sort of ""why are you hitting yourself?"" thing funny or not-and how many times in a row you find it funny."
0," It's the latest reminder that when a strange doctor invites you to work on an experiment in a secluded house, the answer should always be ""No, thank you."""
0," The special effects are better and the dialogue slightly more humorous than in the first movie, but the anti-Arab subtext is repugnant."
0, Adorns its bankrupt inanity in the robes of Importance
2, Jean-Luc Godard set out in 2963 to deliberately make a war film that would be neither dramatically involving nor formally compelling -- and he succeeded so brilliantly that the film was seen as a disaster.
0, Sound City ends up being an exciting look at the making of music.
0," There's so much material that's amusing, and so much goodwill for Bergdorf in the hearts of fashion lovers, that it's a shame this is such an ADD sprawl of a movie."
2," An experimental film that will delight, amuse and intrigue any Dylan lover."
2, Familiar but moving.
2," It's a film to make you weep with sorrow and anger, and one of the most necessary films of the year."
2, [Eminem] goes the mile demanded of him and he emerges a certified winner this time out.
2," An ideal version of this film would be painful and playful, and a good deal less cluttered. But the one we get certainly has delightful moments. After any exposure to this year's unfailingly smelly mainstream romcoms, it's a breeze."
0, Shows early promise but eventually ends up in the bin of ordinariness.
2," Cuaron builds the symbol of a country that has killed their own future, a country that gives a face to the outside when inside, others tirelessly wash the blood spilled or avoid, there, the tragedy of the middle class. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," ...Jolie takes dead aim at the Oscars with Unbroken, and there's something to be said for the fact that her aim is true."
2, Director Terry George tells this painful and complicated story well.
0," Johnny English Reborn is amusing in parts and arguably better than the original, but ultimately it is a throwaway giggle for kids and indulgent parents."
0, The film stands only as one more step to Endgame and nothing more. [Full Review in Spanish]
2," Journalism at its finest, as has not been practiced in the U.S. in some time."
2," ""His Lost Name"" does not manage to stand out (not much at least) from the plethora of similar films released in Japan, but still remains a hopeful debut, and a film that will satisfy most fans of the Japanese contemporary drama. "
2," Digno de ser llamado, la Octava Maravilla del mundo."
0," This is easily the worst film of the year so far, and frankly last year too. It is embarrassingly, painfully unfunny."
2," A movie that has Tarantino's brand of kinetic, eccentric energy but that's much more soulful."
0, ...too much material drawing from his mediocre Le Noise album and the interview segments where Young drives around Ontario telling stories from his youth are less than revelatory.
0, The many plot strands the script tries to weave together get so horrifically tangled they choke the humor out of any given situation.
0," It's not fair to give ""Captain Marvel,"" a perfectly passable popcorn movie, the full weight of the obscenity of this cinematic gender disparity. But after this wait, society deserved better."
2," The Dressmaker may be a revenge comedy, but it never quite conforms to our expectations of what that should mean. And that seems to be exactly how Moorhouse wants it."
2," It is a striking-looking film, and Haneke expertly builds suspense. And yet it feels overlong and never generates the warmth needed to keep audiences involved."
2," Clearly a good director can take the palette of indecision, self-doubt and nerdiness Cera brings to the table and use it to paint some interesting shades of grey."
0," Feature-length reality show masquerading as a documentary. Top-notch craft, lowdown whitewash."
2, The camera delivers an industrial beauty in the apocalyptic landscape which exists only in its lens; a spirit amongst the people who lives there which exists only to be crushed.
0," Despite much effort, neither Johnson nor director George Tillman Jr. can make this preposterous tale, the latest misfire from CBS Films, live up to its title."
0, [A] sorry deep-sea adventure.
2," Enjoyably ridiculous thriller, in which plot logic and characterisation are gleefully ignored in favour of jaw-dropping action sequences, superb fight scenes and Statham's brilliantly deadpan performance."
2," A heart-wrenching tale of lost friendship and redemption, ""The Kite Runner"" is as memorable as a movie as it is a novel."
0, This gruesomely efficient horror sequel shows noticeable wear and tear.
0, Wonderstone's climax revolves around an improbable comeback trick that involves making an entire audience disappear. The movie itself should have no problem accomplishing that feat long before the end credits.
2," Let's go out on a critical limb, shall we? The Lego Movie is the best thing to come along since that other toy-centric movie revolutionized animated films about 20 years ago."
2," As it is, Bahrani has still created an urgent work, the burning anger of which will viscerally connect with many viewers, who will recognize themselves or people they know up on the screen."
0," Often plays like what it is: a clunky toga-and-sandals picture, with Hollywood compromises abounding."
0," The words plod, slow and drag should never even come close to a car chase movie, but that's what comes to mind instantly after watching this clunker."
2," ""Out of the Furnace"" is a straightforward revenge thriller with plenty of atmosphere, character development, and plot twists to make the experience matter. "
0," The theme of reconciliation - between man and woman, father and son, brother and sister, man and animal - feels kind of perfunctory and over-reaching."
2," while its message is undeniably important, it's also so obvious that the film doesn't have any real resonance."
2, A puppy upstages James Gandolfini in his final film.
2," This is heart-wrenching Indian drama in the vein of Deepa Mehta's recent Water, again dealing with a young girl trying to find her self-worth in the midst of a repressive caste system and physical abuse."
0," The filmmakers come off like their protagonist, wide-eyed tourists in an exotic realm. If you've been looking for a martial arts film to take granny and the kids to, this might be the one, but a Jackie Chan-Jet Li collaboration deserves better than that."
0," Yet one more of a series of summer films in which attractive, ambitious young women are punished for not accepting the man-children in their lives despite their torn-teddy-bear flaws."
0, Há uma linha tênue entre uma personagem complexa e outra mal-construída - e Elektra se encaixa nesta última categoria.
2, It's galling how much [the third act] deflates the exemplary first two acts of what could have been a truly great film.
0," Although reminiscent of the line delivery favoured by Yorgos Lanthimos in Dogtooth or Lobster, without the disarming humour of those films the approach just seems arch and rather grating."
0, Hot Tub Time Machine should have been better than this.
2," Bhutto conveys a forceful sense of tectonic social and geopolitical shifts, as well as the courageous, heartbreaking personal sacrifices its subject made in service to both her homeland and ideals. "
2," Patrick Shen has made a fascinating documentary with In Pursuit of Silence, which stops the viewer short in the horrendous cacophony of the modern world."
2, The effect is as scalding as you would expect - a stark and heartbroken monument on screen.
2," While ill-advised in many, many ways, if you're already invested in the saga, there's still enough action and passion to sustain that interest, at least until the final chapter."
0," I'm all for embracing the new and supporting filmmakers with unique visions, but there are still basic tenets of filmmaking that need to be achieved."
2," Sweet, soulful travelogue/comedy isn't just for the birds."
2, ... It's hard not to get the feeling that we've been here before. And that's both part of the movie's fun and what holds it back at times.
2, Craven keeps the story moving at a sprint and writes some agonizingly (and probably intentionally) terrible dialogue.
2, Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's mockumentary about the undead keeps the genre alive and well. 
0," Several previous movies, including 2022's The Last Ride, have attempted to make sense of Williams's life. I Saw the Light should have taken its cue from its unearthly star and pursued a more cosmic mission."
0," The dumbest thing about Andrey Zvyagintsev's new snoozer, Leviathan, is his commitment to that title."
0," He's a strikingly tragic creature, but ""The Happy Prince"" struggles to say much more about that conundrum, leaving one to contemplate the potential had [Oscar] Wilde emerged from retirement to fill in the blanks."
0," ""Back Roads"" is that peculiar kind of disappointment: a wreck about wreckage."
2," One of the best films of the year, Pixar's long-awaited latest scores in every department. Funny, affecting and dramatically fearless, it's as fine a threequel as you could hope for. Bring tissues -- lots of tissues."
0," It makes you think that the previous movies, or the first three really great ones, were all just a fluke."
0," Ultimately, watching Wanted feels like being privy to somebody else's unwholesome fantasy, one you'd rather not know about."
2," One Hour Photo, the meticulously chilling drama that pivots on Sy's dangerous self-delusions, comes closer than any other thriller in recent memory to achieving the Hitchcockian ideal of mortal terror in broad daylight."
2, Makes you realize how much deep physical and psychological weight Cage has to offer when he's unleashed with a script that has his back.
0, Ewan McGregor's inert adaption smooths out the Philip Roth novel's eruptions of self-loathing and doubt. 
2," You've heard this song before and can predict all the emotional high notes before they hit, but sometimes that's all you need from a summer bop."
2, 22 Strong is a solid exercise of film propaganda that at least takes the liberty of creating actual characters and a real reflection over the future of this conflict. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," My own idea of hell on earth but, for girls of a certain age, this is more appealing than just about anything else on the planet."
2, Slumdog Millionaire is [Boyle's] liveliest fusion of style and content since Trainspotting.
2, It's a brisk and energetic primer for those who don't know his movies or are ready to watch them again. And it doubles as a history of the chanbara (sword fighting) genre ...
0," Verdict: a combination of courtroom clichés, family feuds and oddball jokes that is a criminal misuse of star talent."
0, The Visit doesn't contain enough mystery or thrills to be deemed a success...
2," The actor suffered deeply, and however much he's responsible for that, it's hard not to feel some compassion for a bright and sensitive artist who, at least early on, seemed full of life."
2," The story is silly. But like the first TRON, this sequel also pushes the frontiers of what's possible. The movie delivers enough of a wow factor to pull in viewers."
2," not really original considering the first, but still entertaining"
2," A bold, painful memoir located in an innovative middleground between conventional documentary and homemade home-movie collage."
0," At its best, the first-thing-we-do-in-a-dystopian-world-is-kill-teenagers genre hasn't been a shining moment in filmmaking. But now that genetic drift has set in, it's dead-genre-walking, with The Darkest Minds as Exhibit A."
2, Will rightfully be considered a landmark achievement not only for the passionate responses it is causing but because Gibson was able to give one of the oldest and best-known stories in literature such contemporary resonance and power.
0, A more interesting documentary would have further investigated the phenomenon of Shakespeare resonating with such diverse locales.
0, Lover for a Day could not be any more French (in the pejorative sense) if it tried.
2, Director Gerard McMurray stages an effective game of cat and mouse and ramps up to an effective climax.
2," It makes for an intimate portrait of not only the terror felt by children after the night light has been turned off, but in the wonder and dread of the parents who are tasked with keeping those babes safe-and shaping the fancies that dance in their heads."
2, It's ... refreshing to see an Australian movie so heart-on-sleeve about expressing national character.
2, I kept trying to force a connection to it and wondering why I'm not LOVING this movie. I liked it a heck of a lot but didn't LOVE it.
0," Bloated beyond comprehension, overplotted to the point of aggravation, and about as soulless as a ship captain specter, [the film] is a total mess."
0, A strong cast can't rescue the repetitively crude and recklessly derivative material. Mike and Dave need a lot more help than in merely finding wedding dates.
2," The mixture of poetry in motion combined with the hair raising thrill of the cliffhanger are what make Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon one of the best films of the year."
2," Watchable, but somewhat mechanical; mark it down as a C/C minus, and hold out for the DVD."
0," There's a discipline to moviemaking, too, alas, and when this effort strays from its (admittedly limited) subject to a surfeit of helicopter city shots and Ice's street prowling, it feels padded."
0," Coming-of-age drama delivers some laughs, but loses its way when things gets serious"
0," The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another. About half of them are funny, a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story, which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal."
2," A surreal head-scratcher that'd make Luis Buñuel smile, it may not be perfectly formed, but there's no denying its fierce originality."
2," Entirely watchable, albeit disappointingly workmanlike at the same time."
2," Within [its] familiar frame, Final Portrait creates a rich, attractive miniature."
2, Sleepless Night (Nuit blanche) is one frenetic French dream. It's slam-bang mayhem -- with an active intelligence.
2, Captures the almost narcotic sensation of new love...
0, 'Getaway' has accomplished one significant thing. It makes plain that Selena Gomez has no business passing herself off as an actress. 
0," It may be Piglet's Big Movie, but it's a very minor entry in the Disney canon."
0," A raucous, wildly implausible, overlong jumble saddled by a host of misguided creative instincts. It's a potentially warm and delicate story that required a scalpel, but saw the blunt end of a sledgehammer instead."
2, A funny but flawed film that would have benefited from a tighter edit.
0, The only people who will get any enjoyment out of this feature are those who love to ogle Matthew McConaughey shirtless ...
0, I was never engaged in the film's story nor did I care about its main character.
0, [Ti West's] skills are underutilized and the found footage aspect is as sloppy as in a 'Paranormal Activity' number.
2, Flies at the audience like it was shot out of a cannon ... but has its own unique soulfulness as it explores a vortex of intense poverty and violence ...
0," Overall, Mike Mitchell's assault will appeal only to the under-20 set and send everyone else running for ear plugs."
0, The fish is named Justice. The twist is absurd. It is not a good movie. Can't wait to see it again.
2," There is no new ground, really, the distinction is in the way Malick covers it with glorious imagery, symphonies of sound, a cacophony of moods."
2," Winding Refn shakes off the theatricality of his last film, Bronson, for a more intimate approach, and his actors are right there with him."
2," Until the final stretch, Honeymoon is an effectively staged, low-tech exercise in escalating unease."
2," Claudio Miranda's luminous camera, set to Mychael Danna's intoxicating score, captures all manner of wild delights."
2," Noyce has recreated an earlier era. This is a Saigon with foreigners in white suits sitting in cafes to avoid the noonday sun, watching and admiring young Vietnamese women in their Ao Dai pants dresses."
0," You will need a very sweet tooth for this kind of thing, and, to be quite frank, the heist itself is not dramatised all that excitingly or clearly. But I quite like thrillers featuring enormous circular vault doors."
0, The weightiness and the catastrophic implications of the conspiracy don't sit well with what is essentially a Death Wish-inspired revenge fantasy.
2," It's the incidentals that make Baby Driver something special, from the creatively conceived, meticulously scored car chases to the running joke about people's names and their use in songs."
0," Although it faithfully captures the stunning art style of Brian Bolland, the source material itself just feels outdated."
0," Passengers is yet another example of a film that falsely beckons a certain premise in its promotions, yet eventually delivers something far less interesting."
0," In putting young girls in close proximity to demons, the storyline unwisely invites comparison to William Friedkin's The Exorcist."
2," Nichols knows that the key to his film is to just tell their story, simply and directly, and let the other stuff take care of itself."
0," Black, more than anyone else, should have been the one to wind up The House with a Clock in Its Walls. Too bad he doesn't give as much as he takes."
0," Less of an insane soap opera than a lot of Sparks-based movies, so you could do worse."
0, Snyder debe entender que algo oscuro no es precisamente realista.
2," Visually and atmospherically, Marshland is suffused with an eerie oppressiveness, entirely at odds with the region's reputation for light-hearted alegria."
2," Through humor, violence, and drama,'BlacKkKlansman'paints a line of white supremacy from the Civil War to Charlottesville rallies last year."
2," Superhero stories aren't just about fighting, but the examination of self. When Aquaman remembers this, it's a sight to behold."
0," It's time to abandon the nihilistic characters, the bad jokes, the oppressive set pieces, and start anew. The best thing you can do with Transformers: The Last Knight is leave it behind as quickly as possible."
0," Produced by Judd Apatow and co-written by Seth Rogen, Drillbit Taylor has a been there, done that quality reminiscent of Superbad if it were much tamer and less funnier."
2," Sin City is a dark, disturbing, enthralling masterpiece."
2, Brisk and pleasingly outrageous.
0," The stakes in this latest, disappointing Harry Potter wannabe never feel as high as they should, or as important as its characters seem to think they are."
0, A product of commercial confusion that could inspire terror to the smallest children and boredom from those closer to adolescence. [Full Review in Spanish]
2, The complexity of the characters and the simplicity of the story balance out to a rewarding coming-of-age drama for adults.
0, [A] hilariously inscrutable exercise in pseudo-profundity.
0, A lame-brained nut job in search of an identity of its own.
2," The golden standard for classic Hollywood bombast, this one."
0," Jones has limited ideas about funny staging. His go-to move is mashing two to 20 people together into an awkward scrum, then cutting to Vardalos or Paris watching with wide-eyed discomfort."
2," ...the over-explained softened edges of the story turn what could have been an exceptional brain-bender into a good, but fairly standard-issue heart-warmer. "
0," Sensitive and sentimental - bring tissue, it's a weeper."
2," For all its gorgeous freakishness, the movie is even more about love and friendship than the first one was."
2, One of the best times I've had at the movies all year.
0," Oh, how 'The Man With the Iron Fists' longs to be 'Kill Bill.' It isn't, but its environments, blood-letting and martial arts, along with an interesting score and soundtrack, make no bones about its filmmakers being Quentin Tarantino devotees."
2, A soul-scorching drama about the monsters of our past that skulk just over the horizon.
0," This might charitably be called a victory of style over substance, except that there's little of either on display."
2," There are a handful of legitimately funny jokes, even though -- though it frightens me to say so -- I don't get as excited as I got when I was fifteen."
0," Blame the demands of a high-profile production on the sensibilities of someone who, success or failure, has at least never been this boring."
2," Although this is a more standard horror film, the tone is witty and gleefully grisly."
2," More often than not, DodgeBall slings its visual and verbal humor with rapid-fire, spot-on aim without fouling."
0, The hangover on the third day of a three-day binge makes you wonder why you decided to go there in the first place. Apparently it's the same for movies. 
0," Whether anyone really yearned for a sequel to Gnomeo And Juliet, I'm not sure, but a seven-year interval seems about right."
2," While the central yarn delivers the right mix of pathos and frights, it also feels derivative of past works ..."
0," The story meanders, but the subject is timely and important."
0," Rough Night is unbelievably poor. Some of its relentless sloppiness would be forgiven if it were ever funny, but it never is."
0," Such stellar screenwriting consists of each character screaming to the killer, ""LEAVE US ALONE!"" whenever they're two minutes away from being killed."
0," A big, woozy, spacey fairy tale with a science-fiction exoskeleton and a core of pure mush."
2," This isn't some inside joke, it's a universal lesson learnt... even if that lesson is expertly disguised by a brilliantly bizarre and truly bonkers story set in the 'burbs."
2," I already knew a lot about Janis Joplin, but that doesn't mean I didn't learn something - and, I was deeply moved by its inevitable end."
2," Annihilation is a remarkable achievement. It lingers, burned into your thoughts, branded on the brain. It is nothing short of a masterpiece, and the fact that it exists at all is something worth celebrating."
2," Wan's descent into comic book fantasia is close to incredible, even its frequent missteps overflowing in an infectious giddy fervor that's close to wonderful."
2, It's all very smoothly done but comes without a hint of surprise or revelation.
0," By the time the action finally arrives in the film's second half, you no longer care. Any energy you might have invested in this ugly world filled with shallow characters has been squandered on silly spy plots and shoddy storytelling."
2," Beneath the overreaching ambition (pretension?) lies a solidly entertaining creature feature of superior style--maybe not exactly the deep existential examination Scott and Lindelof were striving for, but no small feat all the same."
0, The sequel to Charlie's Angels is a bit like being spritzed in the face with all the bad teenage perfume ever made.
2," Marshall and company have given the old genre a swift, vigorous kick in the pants. Chicago is one movie that won't let us down; it's our kind of town."
2, Probably the best superhero ever made. So many deft touches.
0, As funny and charming as tearing a toenail.
2, This audience-friendly indie sex comedy features almost no sex but plenty of nervous male bonding and a whole new angle on performance anxiety.
2," [Roberto Benigni's] an irritating goofball at times, but there's a genuine sense of tragedy and darkness -- of the most ancient traditions of clowning, in fact -- underneath it all."
2," A lovingly done recreation of the classic, brooding film noir visual style, reeking with atmosphere and gloriously black and white."
0," Oceans floods us with stunning visuals of the panoply of sea life. But without a compelling story, or a strong point of view, or mere information, we can only 'ooh' and 'aah' so much."
2," A contender for one of my favorites of 2007, and damn near superior to its predecessor..."
2, Hepburn still lights up the screen in this uneven Bogdanovich comedy.
2," A $200 million, obscenely fun superhero movie packed with amazing visuals, groovy tunes, wacky action, and unapologetic schmaltz."
2," In no way a fashion statement about sleepwear, but rather a solemnly imaginative political statement about the Germans asleep when it came to exactly what was going down during the Nazi regime. The Final Solution meets The Pied Piper."
2," Me and Earl and the Dying Girl has the ingredients of a teen melodrama... But it admirably opts for a more ambiguous tone befitting adolescent characters who aren't entirely comfortable in their skins, let alone assured in their emotional lives."
0, There's too little character development and no reason to care.
2," Fast-paced and tightly written, this is an entertaining revenge thriller with strong performances, exciting action sequences and an impressively stripped down aesthetic that works well."
0," Though you're expecting the predictable ending, the finale, and what goes on before it, feels phoney and contrived, while a vulgar mean streak throughout only further puts you off."
0, Rubber heads and lines are the order of the night.
2," Director Rob Reiner has a killer instinct for setting up jokes and punchlines, and is vastly aided by the performances and chemistry of Crystal and Ryan, as well as crisp supporting work from Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby."
2," While Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead is a nostalgic look back at some of the most celebrated funny men and women in the genre, it is one with a sense of finality. What once was will never be again: The industry has forever shifted."
2, Ferrara gives a nice flow to this far-from-nice ordeal.
0," Why is ""The Book Thief"" set in Nazi-occupied Germany ... if it won't engage with the era's shattering momentousness?"
2," Ultimately, Nolan's film asks the question: Do the ends justify the means? Dormer is willing to go to cover up the truth to bring about a result that is good for the world."
0," Achieves some romantic uplift when Mitty dreams of Cheryl and literally takes flight, but most of the time, the picture strains to make any kind of sense, much less entertain."
2," Sorkin has made a canny, disjointed thriller of process and exposition, a sort of Goodfellas riff with a nerdy twist."
0," An utterly contrived Vengeful Mothers thriller sold based on its spoiler-alert moments, which aren't all that. But that Lopez lady can dance!"
2," An effective, family-friendly film with a message that provides a valuable introduction to the issues surrounding immigration reform for the next generation of voters."
0, This movie adaption does not live up to the book. 
2," The story of a righteous rescue mission amid unimaginable horror...a sober, historical drama."
0," To believe that players who share ice time with Hull, Jagr and Yzerman are gonna lose to the kid who packs groceries at the local 7-22, you'd have to have frostbite on your brain."
0," Despite some strong performances and the occasional good moment, Traitor never quite gets the tone right and is ultimately undone by an unintentionally laughable climax."
0," Without a kinky moment towards the end where it seems like Alexa is going to lay a big wet one on a Predator, there's almost no reason to stay awake."
2," Engaging, entertaining, empowering superhero adventure. "
2," ...The key to what makes ""I, Robot"" work is a well thought out script..."
0," The direction by Sergio G Sánchez is uneven, the narrative consistently illogical...and the final ""twist"" visible from early in the first act. Disappointing. "
0, [Neil Young's] dotardly video companion to his album of the same name.
0," [A]s accurate as this portrayal of avoidance might be, it doesn't amount to much in terms of sympathizing with or understanding who Vivienne is and what she's experiencing."
0," It's great we are getting to a place where queer characters no longer have to be tragic or outcasts. However, let's still make them interesting."
0," Besides Bentley's performance, the only thing ""We Are Your Friends"" has going for it is the occasional directorial flourish. These jolts are few and far between, but they're most welcome when they arise."
0," There are lots of good things in the movie, but they play more like vaudeville acts than part of a coherent plot. It's a film you enjoy in pieces, but the jigsaw never gets solved."
2," A moving work that is at once bittersweet and uplifting, and altogether charming."
0," Problem is, there's nary a hint of context, even with biographic essentials."
0," Combines a satire of corporate hipsterdom with a metaphor for personal alienation and sexual fantasy, without ever completely committing to either."
0," [VIDEO ESSAY] ""Wild"" is an unsatisfying self-help drama that exposes the limitations of Reece Witherspoon's range. "
2," [A] meeting of musical minds that should thrill lovers of rock music, allowing this movie to easily fit on the shelf along with the rest of their records and CDs."
0, It's a brilliant idea. It just happens to be a terrible movie.
0," The Hulk, like its lead character, is just too big."
2, [Nicholas Cage] works precisely because there is a great actor underneath it all and because he does tap into something so ferocious that other people wouldn't dare to touch.
0, Ugly Sweater Party has achieved the status of landing in my bottom 20 movies of the year. 
0," Although Loach's heart is not so much in the right place as nailed to it, there is no doubt that this makes for gruelling viewing, lacking the glimpses of humour he would show in later work."
0, The detail and clear devotion he has for the sport may actually have the effect of distancing the rest of audience from his film.
2, ...a terminally perfunctory followup that just barely gets the job done...
0, It's not a disaster. It's just drab.
2," A dreamlike profound film of parallel stories, though bleak, confusing and enigmatic, is masterfully blended together."
2, Straight Into a Storm comes alive whenever McCauley and his bandmates reminisce about their old habit of getting wasted and playing guitar while rewatching La Bamba.
0," The movie itself is a bubbly, insipid confection that goes down like a _______ (fill in the product of your choice)."
2," Lucas saved the best of his arguably needless prequels for last, finally justifying an entertainment empire and cementing a myth."
0, The high concept breeds lowbrow gags.
0," Broad and light enough, had one not seen the opening credits, to never, ever be mistaken for a Coen brothers film."
2," It's not a movie for people looking for a decorous night at the movies. It is a film, though, for folks eager for some good dirty jokes, some refreshingly real female characters - and, just maybe, a new comic voice."
2," He makes Geekus Hollywoodium -- always played by someone such as Ben Stiller, whom we know to be fundamentally cool beneath his nerdy veneer -- look like the fraudulent genus we know it to be."
0," While Made in Dagenham is passably amusing, it's clearly not worth much as history, and its rote parade of obvious plot points can get tiresome."
0," ""Raging Bull"" ultimately has a numbing effect on the brain as if one's head had been pummeled by La Motta's so-called ""girlish"" fists."
0," White, who shows promise as a director willing to steer us in unexpected directions, holds the comic moments on a pretty tight leash."
2," Marshall has always been marvelous at painting with bodies and light, and this film benefits from that touch immensely because of the abstraction of most of the songs.It may not make you a fan of the show, but it should make you a fan of Rob Marshall and"
0," Graphic violence, lots of drugs in so-so black comedy."
0," Rich in atmosphere but poor in substance, this slow-burning psychological thriller winds up more tedious than terrifying."
2," Those who see [Gordon Gekko] as an antihero worthy of redemption might find this kinder, gentler Wall Street worth sitting through."
2," From the clever Jaws take-off opening to the final, irreverent title card, laughs come thick and fast."
2, A worthy sequel to a cut-above horror movie.
2," Haneke, a master of icy appraisal, here contemplates an elderly Parisian couple at the very end of their lives."

0, Amateurish noir knock-off ... A Walter Mitty fantasy with training wheels.
0," I don't know if this is the worst batch the Academy has ever managed to compile for consideration, but it's a pretty bad bunch. Some of the films are downright insulting."
2," Peli is daring the audience to look for activity beyond the door frame, catch a shadow moving across the floor, or watch something get tossed across the room to wake up the couple. It's brilliant."
0," The thin concept generates some brief tension before falling apart amid the murky visuals, plus a series of arbitrary and increasingly far-fetched twists."
0, Bargain basement. If it was made in the nineties would have been a routine skin-e-max programmer.
2," A film about sacrifices, yes, but also about goodness and the unpredictability that is the human feeling. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," 'Something Must Break' boasts a japanned depressiveness so reminiscent of Fassbender (think 'Fox and His Friends'). This is the work of an exceedingly original, enormously talented helmer who will no doubt shortly be one of Sweden's most favored exports."
2," Like its predecessor, Iron Man 2 is a fine example of how impressive big budget studio filmmaking can be when it's done right."
0," Every year the DVD will [be] displayed as though it's worthy of renting. But it's out because it takes place around the holidays, not because it belongs to be there."
0," ""The Fifth Estate"" tries to be a cross between ""The Social Network"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Only it's more like ""The Sociopath Network"" meets ""Zero Dumb Thirty."""
2," Stories We Tell, uniquely, reveals its process as if we are thinking, sifting and selecting along with the filmmaker."
2," It's stupid, over the top, ilogical, brilliant, incoherent, and random, a self aware comedy with tons of laughs. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Horrible. I watched it through my fingers. It's the snuff film of comedy. 
0, An uneasy mixture of fact and fiction ...
0, This true story dragged out for so long that I ceased to care.
0, Consider it a predictable movie with flashes of unpredictability.
2," The Legend of Tarzan isn't half-bad, and the film deftly put most of my fears to rest by creating animals and jungles that serve and enhance the story rather than detracting from it."
0," There are some clever and provocative ideas about artificial intelligence swirling around in Chappie, the latest feature from the District 9 director Neill Blomkamp, but much of the film is derivative and messy."
0," When Sleepaway Camp focuses on something other than the rapidly growing pile of corpses, the movie nearly grinds to a halt."
2," This isn't a movie about set-up and payoff, it's a movie about the torment of being stuck in your head, and the insoluble loneliness of walking through a crowd of people who are oblivious to your private suffering. "
2," Although it's entertaining, Bourne has a staid, conventional feel. as if it could have been made at any time in the past 25 years."
0, World-saving is no longer a surprise to these characters. It's work. Grunt work. For them. For us.
0," Red underpants and kryptonite are conspicuously absent, but this dour picture still feels overfamiliar and rote."
0, [Dwayne Johnson's] Goodall-hearted-in-Salmoni squared-physique appeal isn't enough for Rampage to be a competent exercise in mindless fun.
2," While it's well worth seeing, it has to be labeled as a disappointment."
2," The film is stunningly animated, full of wonderful moments and pieces bordering on the unforgettable. Everything thing feels organic and natural and little is ever out of place."
0," The cheap-looking remake ... is more palatable but sluggish.... Faris and Derbez have no chemistry together - not comedically, not romantically, barely even biologically."
0," Overall, though, this is dismal fare."
2," As Crossfire Hurricane reminds us, the Stones were consciously designed to occupy a less reputable place in the pop zeitgeist... They embodied psychic danger, a Dionysian force flirting with all manner of uncontrollable sensuality and violence."
0, 205 painful minutes of a fat guy getting punched in the face and falling down.
0," For a film where so much effort has been put into making the CGI effects look good, a similar amount of emphasis and importance haven't been devoted to dialogues. "
0," Perhaps attractive and charismatic, but it leaves one feeling that something was missing. [Full Review in Spanish] "
2," A brilliantly designed, but emotionally shallow romance set during the infamous sinking of the luxury liner in 2922."
2, ... persuasive in touting his influence ... and its interviews provide an intimate glimpse into his thoughtful and compassionate perspectives.
0," With many cooks in the writing, this CGI adventure is structurally disjointed and dramatically uninvolving, and the chemistry between reliable star Cage and charming Baruchel is not strong, which explains why the producers stress the literary pedigree."
0, Neither the sci-fi nor the comedy are strong enough to sustain the movie.
0, A movie this bad deserves to have its flaws enunciated clearly...
2," The Mist has a lot of the elements to be one of the great horror films, but it never quite puts it all together. It's still very good, but a few missteps keep it from ever being more than that."
0," Joshua Marston's follow-up to his stunning Maria Full of Grace debut gets high marks for nice performances and immersion into a remote Albanian village, but narrative deficiencies render it a disappointment."
0," Eli Roth does gore torture, his forte is not the emotional weight of loss. So, when this movie tries to portray that, it comes off as awkward."
0, Sometimes unintentionally funny but never scary.
2," ...its cast is uniformly impressive, especially the mute, disturbed Dano and the glum ""bad cop"" Gyllenhaal, who effectively turns down the handsome and owns the film with his gaunt, haunted stare."
0," Rather than address how personal idiosyncracies struggle in relationships, Failure to Launch exists in an appalling fantasy world of quota compliance."
2, The makings of a taut little drama are rendered into a reasonably taut piece by a big name cast and a director who once ruined the Batman franchise.
2," Meanwhile, we as an audience are left with the flat, stinging sensation of hitting a wall. But if any feeling could so aptly reflect love in the time of capitalism, then it is this: to willingly hit a wall until an eventual point of demolition."
0, These meager pleasures are swallowed up in all the frantic action and overblown CG sequences.
2," [A] personal, finely realized comedy-drama."
2," The 23-year-old me would have loved it, and I wouldn't be lying if I said that at times the movie turned me back into that 23-year-old kid."
0, Evolution becomes the kind of film that Dad might laugh at more than his 26-year-old son. Chalk it up to residual Ghostbusters goodwill memories.
0," Oliver Twist is a rarity, as far as Polanski films go, in that it is just an OK movie."
2, [An] engaging and resolutely un-dishy travelogue ...
2," The Accountant is, begrudgingly, a pretty good time, especially once its solemnity gives way to its kitschy ode to familial pain."
2," Where There Will Be Blood transmuted sullen earth into flame and launched it violently skyward, The Master is, as its opening shot advertises, a more fluid undertaking, a story of ebb and flow. "
0," Familiar and formulaic, including the outtakes during the final credits."
2," Reichardt has spun another breathtaking ode to life, and to the female experience, with easy humor and most of all, tenderness, that makes the phrase ""Certain Women"" one of rarified honor."
2," ""Something's Gotta Give"" makes for good repeat viewing on DVD. "
0, Only time will tell if Hot Tub Time Machine is the dumbest premise for a time-travel movie of all time.
0, Fairly crackles with character and period flavor for its first 90 minutes but is let down by a repetitive and tiresomely maudlin final half-hour.
0," It may be too on-the-nose to say that Non-Stop doesn't stick the landing, but the speed at which the movie turns from pleasantly diverting to semi-disastrous botch is genuinely disheartening."
0," Neither tribute nor analysis, this doc offers an inappropriately off-beam treatment for such a serious subject."
2," [Qu] handles difficult subject matter with heft and grace in equal measure, giving voice to her film's victims without defining them as mere damsels."
2," ...Whit Stillman's adaptation of Jane Austen's Lady Susan is a surprisingly hilarious period piece that centers on Austen's titular character, played perfectly by a deliciously nefarious Kate Beckinsale"
0," The emotions this film generates would be more accurately encapsulated by calling it ""Man on a Whoopee Cushion."" "
2," Though conventional in many respects, it feels like no other boxing film ever made, due largely to Eastwood's unmistakable presence on both sides of the camera."
0, I'm not going to lie. I laughed - just not as frequently or as hard as I would have liked to.
0," Even the best tend to be little but a joke awaiting a punchline, some funnier than others, some slight, some powerfully bombed."
0," Rather than escapism and sensory exhilaration, viewers get down in the mire with protagonists who grimace, scowl and wince their way through heroics with the joyless determination of shift workers making the doughnuts."
2," Waititi's film has the stylized exaggerations and emotional directness of the best children's literature. Everything is just a tiny bit louder and more colorful than real life, but the feelings are straightforward and unadorned. "
0, Trained eyes will see the great movie a few million bucks away from reality
0, Witless but marginally watchable for almost 70 minutes of its bloated 220-minute length - until it begins to take itself entirely too seriously.
0, The rest is nothing more than a compendium of action scenes filmed in a pedestrian way and without inspiration. [Full review in Spanish]
2," ""Zombie Nazis"" sounds like an unbeatable combination, but it turns out to be one of those great ideas that cannot sustain itself purely on the concept alone..."
2," It's a Parisian romantic roundelay with sundry couples connecting and disconnecting, but it looks and sounds like no sex comedy ever made: It's transcendentally yummy."
2, Riveting and tense docu has frequent cursing. 
2," Is it an Amy Schumer movie directed by Judd Apatow, or a Judd Apatow movie that stars Amy Schumer? It's hard to tell..."
2," Two fans, Stephen Segerman and Craig Bertholomew, made it their business to find out exactly what happened to the singer Rodriguez. And, ""Searching for Sugar Man"" is the fruits of their labor. The fruit is tasting pretty sweet."
2," And apparently there's life after Downton Abbey. In a 280-degree departure from that show's scheming Miss O'Brien, actress Siobhan Finneran plays Swifty's abused, soft-spoken mum. She and the boys are wonderful."
2," Make no mistake, Ee Nagaraniki Emaindi belongs to Tharun Bhascker. The filmmaker's flair for comedy once again shines through and his dialogues are terrific."
0, The title - insipid as it is - is more interesting than anything that actually appears on screen.
0, The leaden screenplay can be fingered for many of the film's faults. But what happened to the off-kilter film-maker last seen at work in To Die For?
0," As this drama begins... the British prime minister is silhouetted on the horizon, a hunched, rotund figure, with his black Homburg, overcoat and cane, giving perhaps the first sign that this film will take the iconic and turn it into cliché."
0, Does a sub-par job probing the psyches of both Buddhafield's leader and its members.
0," Never completely loses the viewer's interest, but the edgy, enigmatic would-be momentum goes slack in the second half as the slim plot extends to 97 minutes when 80 would have made for a tauter experience."
2," A surprisingly tender Irish comedy, which traverses the depths of modern masculine identity, whilst aping the tropes of the genre."
2, Devastating postmortem on a dead dot-com.
0," It's a decent, if unlikely premise, but Jesse Peretz's film still falls somewhat flat. There are a couple of notable comic high points... but the movie is more a series of polite chuckles than belly laughs"
0, Boll directs the film as indiscriminately as his characters fire their weapons.
0," It's only January, but Dirty Grandpa is so desperately unfunny and excruciatingly endless at 202 minutes that it's dead certain for a top spot on lists of the year's worst movies."
2, A glorious and almost terminally pure coming-of-age story.
2," This creepy, clever, edge-of-your-seat thriller succeeds because it plays on your imagination, your fear of the dark and the unknown and the unseen, as opposed to showing graphic displays of violence and brutality."
2," Kore-eda takes the time to affectionately dissect the way family functions, before carefully deconstructing it and revealing the contoured complexities that live within."
0," By trying too hard to stay on this side of hip and the other side of sentimental, Crowe winds up with a zoo that's neither fish nor fowl."
0," Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs...a sad sitcom of a movie, largely devoid of charm."
0," ""Thanks for Sharing"" has several nice moments and understated insights, but it never quite gets to the heart of its subject."
0," Loud, vicious, tasteless, and inane, it thunders at you from every direction with a wild abandon that is more irritating and desperate than enlivening"
2," A workman-like, if not inspired, tale of survival with a great international cast."
0," Seagal at his most minimal, saying and doing less in this film than in practically any film he's been in. Maybe it's for the best."
0, One could excuse the lack of factual detail if the movie had some focused impression to suggest.
2," For a second film, Us has a Spielberg-like confidence."
0, The most curious thing about this magical realist fable is how charmless and ultimately forgettable it turns out to be in the hands of Tim Burton.
2," That human touch is what distinguishes In the Shadow of the Moon from run-of-the-mill documentaries and is a timely reminder, in these dark days, that mankind is capable of much that is good."
0, The film's inability to decide whether it wants to be sweet and life-affirming or vicious and nasty creates not only a disconnect on the story level but results in tonal shifts that are dizzying.
2," There isn't a character in the large, excellent cast that doesn't emerge with depth and precision."
0," Beneath its stale platitudes about being a nice person and living every day like it's your last, the film doesn't offer much meaningful exploration of its moral complexities."
0," Yours, Mine and Ours is indeed recycled garbage, but it's fairly harmless recycled garbage. It's certainly not enough to make you gag. Set your standards low, and the worst you should get is a hiccup or two."
0, Coppola's latest never seems to know what it wants to be - it works best when it is a blackly comical parody but it too often pulls its punches and is never quite brave enough to be bold.
0," Unfortunately, while Hitman: Agent 47 may offer a passable diversion for the action fans among us, for everyone else it's best avoided."
0," Gidding's script prioritises the scientific process over any kind of drama or character, and the bulk of the movie which details this process can seriously plod. "
0, Cusack's climactic confession is heartrending. But too many other moments strain credibility.
2," Romero's script isn't a thing of grace and beauty, but it achieves a sort of brawny entertainment that works in the moment."
0, Nobody but July could have made a film so defiantly insufferable.
2," Leigh is as interested as Turner in the elusive, the evocative and the essential. "
2," Holmes and Watson is not for everybody, but if you want to see Ferrell off the leash this is the best opportunity in a long time."
2," Old Joy, a reticent, delicate film, is riveting because not much happens."
0," Writing jokes is hard. Writing potentially funny situations is marginally easier, but only because the potential doesn't have to be realized before the paycheck is cashed."
2," Washington spins for us the wreckage of a life strained by the tension between achievement and defeat, a person who thinks that he can master the odds. But, the mastery is in the actor's fine portrayal."
0," It has become something of a tradition to dismiss the latest Adam Sandler movie outright or, if one is feeling particularly generous, damn it with faint praise. Blended is no exception to this strategy."
0," Unless you're an M Night Shyamalan fanatic aching to see the writer/director play one of the film's main characters, there's no reason to endure Lady in the Water."
0, Hugo's best moments are those that aren't actually Hugo.
0," [A] wholly unpleasant, ungratifying experience."
2, a deceptively simple story with a multiplicity of subtle insights
0, Exciting but frequently incomprehensible.
2," With strong echoes of Jim Jarmusch movies, this is an enjoyably quirky comedy-drama with offbeat dialogue, a great soundtrack and a brilliant central performance from Sean Penn..."
2," This may be one of the most repulsive movies I've ever seen. It's also an important movie, laying bare the farce that equality and justice become in the face of power, privilege, and money."
2," Some of the laughs are inspired and big, and while you wish the movie was as cruel as you know the figure skating world really is, at least it isn't afraid of being silly."
0, Hell is Marley & Me.
2," [Soderbergh's] total avoidance of camp and his deeply sympathetic treatment of both major characters is a way... to make Liberace and Thorson people, not stereotypes."
2," [Director] Aaron Katz... may not have much money to work with but has everything else - a sly sense of humor, a light touch with relationships, and a keen sense of visual beauty. These virtues are all on display in this dreamy shape-shifter of a picture."
0, The characters as written never achieve the resonance that would keep viewers engaged and invested in them. They remain pawns in an exercise of mannered absurdity.
0, Disjointed and unsatisfying. While some stories soar - the titular vignette is stirring and beautiful - too many others fall flat or get lost in the search for profundity as characters spend an inordinate amount of time staring into the middle distance.
2," ""Pawn Sacrifice"" whips up a dervish of energy and is mostly engaging, yet the movie isn't a definitive checkmate. The narrative ferocity is unable, try as it might, to smooth over some of the bumps in the story and gaps in the plotting."
2," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 wanders, but that doesn't mean it's lost."
2," It's certainly not the most memorable of films, but as a humorous blockbuster action Hercules is worth its weight in gold."
0," Lady in the Water, The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth sullied Shyamalan's reputation, and The Visit does nothing to resurrect his brand."
2," In Petit's melancholy final monologue, The Walk manages the most skillful high-wire act of all: being moving, without stumbling."
2," Doesn't make much sense, but its action works"
0, What this film needed was a whole lot more scenes with the good actors and lot less scenes of those Ken and Barbie Doll types.
2," ""In Secret"" doesn't judge its characters' behavior. What it does, instead, is show the bad choices they make and the terrible ramifications of those choices."
0, Who could ever anticipate a movie with absolutely nothing going on in it but bad taste?
0," The Nicholas Sparks novel inspired movie is neither inspired nor novel. For those who love this stuff, your sugary treat awaits."
0, Linklater has used witnesses to the truth to tell a lie. 
0," Instead of a black comedy about powerful U.S.-government employed parasites pulling dirty tricks on foreign soil, we get a silly revenge story about two rivals who are supposed to be really smart - something we rarely see."
0, The pairing of these two talents should never have been frittered away on such an inconsequential and lightweight conceit.
0," That the film, directed in swift strokes by F. Gary Gray from a screenplay credited to Kurt Wimmer, doesn't really work -- unrelentingly grim, unintentionally funny -- is almost beside the point. It's a wild concept."
2," But his sterility and romantically curved plot, twisted as it might be, feel respectively reductive and pat next to Palahniuk's fast, filthy and scabrous satirical stabs."
0," I think the movie did a good job informing me... However, it can seriously drag and a choice to involve interpretative dance did not work at all."
0, Winnie the Pooh is timeless and unforgettable. The same qualities don't apply to this tale of the real-life people and circumstances that inspired his creation.
0, This movie I think really did the impossible. It makes Failure To Launch look like The Thin Man.
2, The fact that Elysium comes close to greatness - classichood always feeling tantalisingly within reach - only makes its failings more frustrating.
0," Woody Allen has many ups and downs in his directorial career, and this is definitely in the latter category."
0, And the streak of non-lousy Shyamalan films stops at two. 
2," It's entertaining enough, even boasting the odd moment of dry wit, and the rooftop finale amid a New Orleans Halloween parade is arresting."
2," At the end of the day it is a pretty formulaic bromantic comedy, and the little bit of a twist it has can't hide that fact. But it's done really, really well and that counts for a lot."
2," A story of political and spiritual corruption, of men and women accustomed to power, and of others fighting against it."
2," Even on a hot night, audiences might find themselves shivering at this movie."
2," The honesty of children is sobering. You see first graders without any ego or melodrama, yet talking about what school isn't giving them, there's your story right there."
2," Delroy Lindo ... gives a commanding, strangely touching performance."
2, A smart thriller for a smart audience.
0, Harlin amps up the sound effects and gore in an attempt to disguise the absence of any genuine scares.
2," 'Gimme Shelter' is not a concert film but a statement of a sea change, of the group way back when and of an end to its and the public's innocence and to the counterculture that once flourished. "
0," ""Cars 2"" is a Honda needing a body shop as compared to the pristine Ferrari that was ""Cars"". It's an unequal Pixar blend for adults and kiddies that never evolves into the storytelling success of its predecessor."
2," Shakun Batra's beautifully performed drama, about a family lurching from one crisis to the next, is part of a recent development towards 'Happy endings with reservations' in popular Hindi cinema."
2," Thanks to its nonstop jokes, strong, likable characters, and marvelous cast, the movie is hysterical."
0," The camera cuts back to Peter, wiping his brow as he observes, ""Sport is cruel."""
0," Slick, super-contrived, pretty to look at and totally, completely preposterous."
0," It's as inhumane to the actresses as it is to the audience that's supposed to receive it as ""family entertainment."""
0," The Mountain Between Us fails almost exclusively because of Kate Winslet. It's a case of good actress in the wrong film, playing across a good leading man who just doesn't resonate on her frequency."
2, Sharp physical filmmaking; a superb performance by a stewing Cooper; morally ambiguous storytelling. 
2," Hüller is amusingly discombobulated as the uptight Ines. But the film is perhaps best appreciated as a showcase for the gifted Simonischek, whose portrayal of Winfried/Toni is one for the ages."
0, Hollow and pointless - a better title would have been 'Incoherent Vice.'
2," Ambitious, visually striking and virtually nonstop in its carnage..."
2, After all the debate about this film...what Gibson has delivered is his own passionate vision.
2, Its content is still provocative.
0," Continuity has become a thing of the past for the franchise, which would help itself by not continuing anymore."
2," There are many, many moments in Hail, Caesar! that work great, are funny in the way that only the Coens can be funny, and capture the mood of the era perfectly."
0," I could describe Rise of the Planet of the Apes as Escape from Alcatraz, except with apes, but that would make it sound like a movie you might actually want to see."
2," A worthy dark horse in this year's Oscar race, The Last Station is a terrific mix of pedigreed actors and material."
0," It's so lacking in heartfelt frights or cheap scares that the few real hair-raising moments, in the finale, don't pay off."
0," The level of foolishness here is simply too high, and the execution so slapdash that the result doesn't seem so much a parody of amateurishness as an example of it."
2," I didn't learn too much about Cobain, but got a fascinating insight into the mind of Love."
2," Border's hyper-realistic aesthetic combined with jaw-dropping, phenomenal performances is cinema magic at its best."
0, A horrid assault on the senses.
0," Cliche-ridden and strangely aloof, Miseducation elicited little in the way of an emotional response from me beyond frustration."
2," Capably blends action, sci-fi and comedy into one colorful concoction."
2," A riveting, gut-churningly tense and eye-opening window into the brutal and bloody world of post-9/22 intelligence gathering ..."
0," ""The Great Buster was a meandering and jumbled story that didn't do this cinematic genius justice."""
0," The conflicts are undercooked, Johnny Depp's performance rote and the film mired in a sort of existential haze."
2," Add a cool narration by the incomparable Samuel L. Jackson, though, and you have something really special."
0," A wilfully old-fashioned, oddly soothing sprawl of cool cars, heavy weaponry, chain-link fences and cackling crooks."
2, Anna and the Apocalypse has a chance to be both a cult favorite and an annual holiday tradition.
2," It may not be original, but Adam could leave a lump in your throat."
0," A viewer is bound to be disappointed with Yatra, for it doesn't do justice in capturing the essence of a charismatic leader like YSR."
0," The only good thing to come from this is the opportunity for Gary Oldman to impersonate space travel impresario Richard Branson, and even that gets old fairly quickly."
2," There's a skillful appreciation here for the kind of subjective dislocation behind the best ghost stories, and in this era of bloody-disgusting, that kind of smart ambiguity is welcome indeed."
0, The movie often seems to be exploiting as much as illuminating the problem.
2, It's a simple story on paper but Anomalisa is a great conversation generator. I'm still reflecting on its style and themes. 
0," Stunts, gadgets and Bill Murray in a tree: Get Smart hurls everything at the screen in the hope it'll stick. Shame all the money went on the dopey action finale instead of some halfway witty gags and a decent script."
0, There may be only so many ways you can spin a computer-generated animated feature about a gang of animals and their grand project against an evil adversary.
0, The problem with these new comedy sequels is that they feel uncomfortably forced. Sometimes it's better to not go back. Sometimes it's better to just leave things exactly where they are.
0," However you cut it, with all that talent, Charlie Countryman feels like a sad, wasted opportunity."
2," Promoted as a prequel to Twin Peaks, but it was actually Excalibur pushed through the heart of a phenomenon, leaving the faithful to grieve, while newcomers were left baffled, or in my case, ravenous for more."
2, The movie is enough fun that it will be a good one to buy on DVD. That's the only way to enjoy all the jokes and see the massive amount of characters who populate this latest brick-built world from LEGO.
2," Despite its disjointed structure, Gomorrah comes to a narrative convergence without ever actually having to bring its stories together. Each climaxes independently, yet it all feels like one piece."
2, Mad To Be Normal lingers well after the credits have finished rolling.
0, Kickboxer: Vengeance is a glossy update of the original Kickboxer; but gloss doesn't mean better. Give me a more realistically formidable bad guy and a drunken JVCD bar fight any day of the week.
0, Director Joe Dante throws in every special effects trick in the book to give some heft to the skimpy script but it doesn't work.
2, Gripping and surprisingly lively account of rock-climber Aron Ralston's ordeal while trapped in a Utah canyon. James Franco excels in this virtual one-man show.
0," Formulaic fluff, amateurishly acted and clumsily directed in the non-musical scenes. But the dancing has energy and verve."
2," Put aside your longing for a conventional narrative, and Tran's exquisite tone poem could yet prove to be one of the most beautifully poignant films you'll come across in some time."
0," Billed as children's fare, G-Force's incessant action provides trainer wheels for youngsters soon to grow into the teens who have made Bruckheimer's live-action films such moneyspinners."
0, This sensual romance between Prison Biscuits Brolin and Lady Nightgown nearly succeeds in making an enjoyable Nicholas Sparks movie until an ending so saccharine it'd make a hummingbird puke. 
2," Other movies this summer may be good or bad, but chances are they won't be nearly as unabashedly fun as ""Fast and Furious 6"" "
0, Another example of filmmakers insulting the intelligence of their audience
2," The film's strengths emerge in its willingness to listen (if not agree), and to give Pastor Fisher and her flock plenty of rope to hang themselves with."
0," As the story gets weaker and lazier, neither Winslet nor the stunning visuals can save the film from descending into camp and confusion."
2," A handsomely made, powerfully acted but not particularly probing drama."
0," It is seriously let down by an inability to put up the words The End. The final 40 minutes constitute the most drawn-out ending I have seen, almost unwatchable."
0, Jaw-droppingly awful.
2, A skillful and convincing rise-and-fall story.
0," Not likely to go over too well with Mayor Bloomberg and his tourism bureau, is this tabloid cinema crooked cop thriller and ghetto housing project horror spree looking worse than an Afghan war zone on a bad day."
0," There's no sense of visual artifice to match the ludicrous pitch of the script, and subsequently, the film comes off as awkward and uncertain. "
0," Zombie works the camera well and his music talents allow for a good use of the hard rock score, but ultimately despite all the visual trickery there's a lack of atmosphere, tension and even shock."
2, Remake whatever you want if it's this funny.
2," Mungiu's human comedy leaves off where it begins (spoiler alert): out in the middle of nowhere, no direction home."
0, [M]erely a Very Special Episode of a TV series I never wanted to watch.

0," Like the aliens themselves, the cliches were coming too fast. Unlike the aliens, they are indestructible."
2," With the moving, absorbing drama Sugar, Boden and Fleck not only avoid the sophomore slump, they demolish it, delivering a film of rare intelligence, beauty and compassion."
0, For every sequence involving Lino's parkour skills ... there are at least two setpieces that are rather nondescript.
2," It's an engrossing, forthright adventure."
0," What say we let these folks take another stab at it with a better script, OK?"
2," Now into their eighties, the Taviani brothers show with this remarkable, fresh and moving drama-documentary they have lost none of that mix of observational rigour and sympathy for the underdog that marked early films like Padre Padrone."
0," For those who can take it, the film offers an experience that's literally wild."
2, [A] lushly detailed and passionately performed melodrama ...
0," A single, plotless day in New York in the company of Keanu Reeves feels like a life sentence."
2," It's a warm, earnest and lively movie, anchored by a superb lead performance."
0," Stuck somewhere between straight thriller, comic tale and over-the-top schlockfest..."
2," Likeable Hollywood comedy with strong comic performances from a superb cast, though it's a shame it's not a little more daring."
0," Although you couldn't find two better actors, they seem to have more movie-star chemistry than chemistry as a couple."
2," Perhaps with the intention of seducing a wider audience, Simardi and the Whissells have managed to make clear that there is a generational sensitivity that needs to grow as urgently as possible. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2," Overlooking a disappointing conclusion, War of the Worlds is a marvelous entertainment of imagination, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and surprising thoughtfulness."

2, King is the product of impressive craft and energy.
2, A subtle indictment of our universal belief that what's good for the Kardashians is good for the gander. 
2," a gentle, sensitive film about a gentle, sensitive man."
0," ""Little Boy"" is a as phony as a game of three-card monte."
0," Rather than an epic continuation of Jackson's Middle-earth obsession, the film seems more like the work of a man driving around a multilevel parking garage without being able to find the exit."
2," Lust, Caution is so ambitious and detailed that you'll never be bored."
2," With piercing hilarity, The Kindergarten Teacher dares us to work out for ourselves, from moment to moment, whether Lisa is a hero, a monster, or something in between."
0," Christopher Cain directed this western from a script by John Fusco, and on the whole seems much more comfortable with the scroungy and scatological dialogue than he does with the action sequences."
2," Like television's Six Feet Under and the recent film Juno, it's the perfect antidote to the dopey, butter-cream-frosted teen flicks of John Hughes -- Pretty in Pink with poison sauce."
0," Alas, there are no sparks. There is no excitement. Hopkins' clumsy script simply bumbles its way past plot holes into predictabilities."
0," Co-writer/ director Catherine Hardwicke has a talent for bringing emotion to the screen, but she must learn to channel it toward a deeper understanding of the characters."

2, Man of Steel indirectly tackles the conundrum of how a mankind engrained in monolithic religion greets the concrete proof of a mythological figure. Is it possible for an alien from Krypton to reside alongside an unquestioning faith in Christ?
2," The classic adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play, featuring one of Marlon Brando's legendary performances."
0, A wisp of a story with no variation in pace links cycle chases and violent battles.
0," It will appeal to people who like their melodrama repackaged with faux cynicism in a bid to reach those that wouldn't have touched the story had it been told straight; that is, without Murray's cultural cachet. "
0, In the 99 very slow minutes an expected jump or two is about all you get. And they're not even that good.

0," By the end, Cheap Thrills too closely resembles the behavior it depicts."
0," Anderson's take is ultraviolent, ridiculously stupid and kind of a rush. If your brain has an 'off' switch, you're well-advised to use it. And the carnage is relentless."
0," We've seen it all before, only now the goop is computer generated."
2," A loose adaptation of The Little Mermaid that's full of fantastic visuals and genuine whimsy, but a little lax when it comes to plot logic or meaningful themes."
0," Compared to the dramatic riches Kitano used to find amid the bloodletting, Outrage's feels pretty paltry."
2," A magnificently small-focus, character driven, nice summer movie... the first and very possibly the only obviously personal tentpole movie of 2022."
0," Lo que podría haber sido una original road movie en tren termina diluyéndose en una experiencia caprichosa, carente de humor y sensibilidad, y finalmente algo irritante."
0," H. simply doesn't feel fully formed, keeping us at a narrative distance from its otherwise relatable characters."
0," With a subject like Roman Polanski, you don't really need to do much to capture audience interest. But maybe that's the reason Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired doesn't live up to its promise."
2, Pixar's 2995 Toy Story and its superlative 2999 sequel ushered in the supremacy of computer-generated animation.
2," You'll never know quite when 20,000 Days on Earth ends, or when it begins - but the feeling of being caught up right in the middle of it is unforgettable."
2, Chistpher McQuarrie has built an exciting and entertaining film full of action: mission accomplished. [Full review in Spanish]
2," Director Paul Feig has taken Wiig's and Mumolo's terrific script and given us the first, big comedy hit of the year. And that's not something to be taken lightly."
0," Singular and unforgettable, but also grotesque and hyper-inflated; hard to pass up, but harder to sit through."
2," It's insane, it's ridiculous, it's way over the top, and while it might not be the best in the franchise, it mostly delivers what its target audience wants."
0," While Travolta has his moments, the woefully uneven film too often settles for mobster stereotypes rather than providing meaningful insight into its subject."
2," How To Train Your Dragon retains a dash of the modern, winking attitude that's served as the not-always-welcome trademark of DreamWorks Animation, but its emphasis falls squarely on heartfelt storytelling and sumptuous images."
2, ... intoxicating movie. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Once you get over the 'ooh-ah' factor and tuck into the ultraformulaic tale, Dinosaur is a dino-snore."
0," Derivative and tedious, unless you really like lots of macho twerps beating and cutting each other, endless shots of drugs being snorted and swallowed, and swearing, unimaginatively, with every other word."
0," The Informers isn't dull but the characters are hollow and the dialogue stilted. In the hands of the film's less experienced actors, it verges on the embarrassing."
2, What if I told you that one of the coolest and most creative films of the fall starred.... Jean Claude Van Damme?
2," The challenge of ""Pawn Sacrifice"" was to capture the colorful Cold War '70s, the inner strategies of one man's paranoid mind and make chess cinematic. Check, and mate."
2, The often-mesmerizing Milford Graves Full Mantis is also one of those documentaries where you wish the music being played identified onscreen at the time.
2," Filmmaker Margot Nash digs deep into the backstories of her parents and sisters to discover the truth behind her uncomfortable childhood. Using archival material, The Silences is a lyrical, sometimes haunting assemblage of what she found."
0," If ""Emperor"" were eight minutes long, it would be brilliant."
2," Once again, Spike Lee has found an innovative theatrical production and brought it to blistering cinematic life."
2," Holes is a hoot from start to finish, one of the most deliciously imaginative children's films to hit the screen in many a moon."
0," A film can't just rely on the surefire ingredients a big-budget film needs to become a box-office success. This film did, and because ""Contraband"" played it too safe and didn't take risks, its surefire bet misfires."
2," a crackling cat-and-mouse game... What makes the film truly absorbing, however, is the volatile interplay between Hopkins and Gosling, two sensational actors who genuinely seem to enjoy going for each other's throats."
0, What goes on in the frames of this film plays like an understanding of procedure but nothing of soul.
0," Un drama intimista y sutil, alejado de cualquier explotación morbosa, sobre un tema poco transitado por el cine. Falla un poco en convicción dramática, pero algunas actuaciones elevan el interés."
2," George Tillman says Soul Food is based in part on his own family, and I believe him, because he seems to know the characters so well; by the film's end, so do we."
0," I was most interested in Taylor Swift. You can tell the girl can act, given half a chance--which she doesn't quite get here."
2, Her majesty is in good company.
2, A vivid portrait of the sort of politician we desperately need today.
2," 2 Guns is at Zen-like peace with the fact that it doesn't matter one bit, and I chucked and gasped through every not-mattering minute."
0," This wilfully terrible film marks a significant juncture in Johnny Depp's peculiar career. It is, to him, as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was to the Balkan League."
2, It's a bizarre and surprisingly clever concept that really makes the most of it for a lot of laughs.
2, Truly the best thing about Captain Marvel is Captain Marvel.
0," There's none of the humor that takes the sting out of slasher movies, and certainly none of the psychology and depth that made The Silence of the Lambs such an intellectual thriller. "
2," More than anything, you'll watch it for Arnold."
0," For a film that reminds use over and over that this is a whole new world, this movie feels awfully familiar."
2," Advantageous makes a superb showcase for Kim, a hugely underrated and underutilized talent. "
2, ...there reaches a point at which one is essentially forced to surrender to the Wachowskis insanely broad modus operandi...
2, I would say watch Blessed Are The Children first and then watch Triggered to see the progression of Moore's writing and directing abilities.
2," Spielberg's themes are often presented too broadly, with the human need for a place to call one's own hammered on until we expect to see ET himself phone home."
0," The ad for it claims, The Punishment Begins April 26. And boy, does it. About 2 hour, 59 minutes worth of punishment."
0," As written by Ed Neumeier, who also wrote Verhoeven's much tighter Robocop, Starship Troopers never gets over its 280-degree swivel from teen-age love story to murderous destruction."
2," The sentiment was inevitably sickly, the comedy broad...but there was a zing of casual cruelty and gleeful grotesquerie that you just can't get from the latest Julia Donaldson animation."
0," Africa never gets inside the heads of its characters. They may be based on actual people, but they're flat as cardboard."
0, The General's Daughter is an overheated thriller populated by actors who far outclass the material.
0," If Companion were merely an exercise in styles, it would be a complete success. Problems arise in conjuring a storyline to fill the space between acts, or to give the movie an arc."
0, The only pressing burden in this deep interior world is the question: What in or on Earth is a cast this good doing in a movie this ridiculous?
0," The film is intriguing, but ultimately opaque, a lovely, inert object that offers, in the name of movie love, an escape from so much that is vital and interesting about movies."
2," Beauty and the Beast remains one of Disney's very best animated masterpieces. Featuring a timeless story, memorable characters, and beautiful music, it's an unforgettable film that has been admired by millions of fans for the last 25 years."
2," I left its... premiere on an adrenaline high as if I'd just seen the latest Mission: Impossible movie, giddy from the ride I'd just taken."
0," Despite a handful of great jokes, this is ultimately disappointing - it's badly plotted, badly acted and occasionally downright embarrassing."
0, Nothing about Cake is remotely tempting or sweet.
0, The least interesting adventure ever filmed.
2," Both below and above the earth, Good Luck offers us a fascinating and heartbreaking universe. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2, The Babadook lures you in with the familiar childhood fears about something lurking under your bed but delivers something fresh and even surprising.
2," It's still something distinctive and different in a sea of shiny mirrors, all reflecting the same slick CGI style back at each other."
0," As a portrait of a young man's rather late coming-of-emotional-age, it's pleasant but unexceptional...firmly situated in the mediocre middle."
0," It just looks like a low-rent mishmash of Divergentand The Hunger Games, recycling riffs from Logan's Run with sets and costumes lifted from Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey."
2," No one is going to confuse Brick Mansions with art, nor even an action film that lives up to the standards of its contemporaries or the original on which it's based. It is, however, kind of fun, and in this case, maybe that's enough."
0," One really bad movie, folks. Don't be a fool and waste your time and money on it. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)"
2," Clipped at the wings in Howard's adaptation is a rich pagaent of esoteric knowledge and French history. Beneath every calling card is a better, truer story... the information is out there in the public domain for modern tropes, however twisted."
0," Offering both too little material and too much, the movie leaves us in the bizarre position of understanding its subject no better by the end than we did at the beginning."
2," Stylishly shot, it works well as a thriller; the result is energetic and entertaining, without the feeling of difficult truths being forgotten."
2, An engaging portrait of the transcendent power of music as well as a moving testimony to the effect of political turmoil on individual artists.
0, Need for Speed feels like the snuff film of racing movies.
0, The Commuter forfeits a good movie about why an everyman might get ensnared in some lite Hitchcockian mishegoss for a mediocre one about how he might weasel his way out of it
2, Sicilian Ghost Story is a melancholy poem to the part of us we can't allow to be wrung out by the complacency and compliance of adulthood.
2," ...if you want to see William Gibson's Death Wish--and apparently I do--click ""I Agree"" to Upgrade."

2," Drive dynamically merges a terrific film noir plot with a cool retro look, evoking '60s classics like Point Blank and Bullitt."
0, Gluttons for footage of Bradley Cooper and meticulously plated white-tablecloth dinner entrées may be the only consumers able to stomach this foodie road-to-redemption drama.
0," A better sales pitch -- to the stars, the producers, the nascent studio, and maybe the ""See McConaughey skinny-dip"" public -- than movie. "
0, The real schmucks are the people responsible for this movie.
0," Needless padding is the enemy of competent storytelling. The Desolation of Smaug is frustrating because you sense how much Jackson is in love with Tolkien's material, and how much that love has caused him to lose sight of what this tale should really be."
2," Some hyper-energetic characters manage to inject some pizazz, and the action scenes are frantic enough to hold the attention of viewers of all ages."
2," A pretty, somewhat sleepy and finally strange once-upon-a-time tale..."
0, Divorce is more fun than this film.
2," Up is quite wonderful entertainment blending moving moments with action-packed sequences and comedy. Buoyant and beautiful, it is a movie must."
0," Each of the key characters feels disenfranchised in some way, but the meandering ensemble story doesn't reach any real conclusions."
2," American Splendor is, like the comic, hip in structure but refreshingly square in its emotions -- smart and sad and sweet and funny, all in one outstanding package."
2," GTFO is confronting, frightening and, at times, disheartening, yet it's ultimately optimistic and needs to be seen."
0," By reducing the girl with a dragon tattoo to a more conventional action heroine, the film makes her less interesting and itself more disposable."
2, Ideal Home is a charming warm-hearted comedy which is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.
0, It loses steam once the wraiths become fully visible: they're just not scary enough.
0," There is chipmunk gambling. There is seductive dancing by Chipettes wearing only towels. There is a musical gag involving the lyric ""whip my tail back and forth."""
0," As alien invasions go, this ranks as one of the most inept in movie history."
0, The Lone Ranger stokes the legend but its smoke signals only add to the haze.
2, This dark fable is a subversive stomach-churner and not for the faint-hearted.
2," As a whole, I cannot recommend Wolfman's Got Nards enough for those who love The Monster Squad, for fans of the horror genre, or even for anyone who has ever felt misunderstood by the world at large. "
0, A movie that begins with a somewhat promising premise but quickly devolves into a dopey action thriller.
2," Scruffy, lived-in working class comedy that makes the most of its ""breastaurant"" setting. "
0," Foregoing substantial character development for a lot of back-and-forth squabbling between people who can't make up their minds, the film is often frustrating in its dumbed-down repetitiveness."
2," The movie belongs mostly to Whitaker, who can convey affection, sadness and disapproval while scarcely raising his voice or an eyebrow."
0," The eerie buildup is mostly pro forma... But the backstory of the haunted house, revealed slowly in sepia-toned hallucinations, really is creepy."
0," I'm not sure what world of women Kasdan experienced to define his characters, but in In the Land of Women they're about as realistic and interesting as cardboard."
0," ""Self/less"" is a celluloid smoothie blended from dozens of familiar elements, but it's neither tasty nor nutritious."
2, It does an admirable job of exploring the physical and emotional sacrifices required to be a success in the highly competitive world of ballet.
0," A few jokes, a few jolts, a few stereotypes -- a much more conventional ""found footage"" film. "
2, An old pro's demonstration of how a politically relevant big-release flick can still effectively be done.
2," It's rough, it's bleary and the acting is dodgy, but, let's face it, the collapse of human civilisation won't look like a Zack Snyder or even a Danny Boyle movie - it'll look like the discarded home movie footage from hell."
2, Surprise and tension make this Korean police mystery a fun ride
0," Frankly, there isn't anything in Exodus we haven't seen before by DeMille and on a grander and more stirring scale."
0," The Proposal often lies flat where it should spark, with director Fletcher failing to maximize her talented cast's potential. The timing is off in several scenes, and a would-be outrageous character inspires more eye rolls than laughs."
0, Less a movie than a Technicolor op-ed on the housing crisis.
0," It's at once familiar and bizarre, overstuffed yet half-baked. And while it boasts impressive individual elements, the overall result remains far from the magic it seeks."
0, Am I the only one who wouldn't mind seeing Jason Statham play something besides a coolly efficient butt kicking machine?
2," Once the initial shock of the graphic material fades, ""Nymphomaniac: Volume I"" is quite a compelling story."
2, ... Trouble is to film noir what Once Upon a Time in the West was to the western: the final word.
2," Watch this if you are in the mood to see a stoic, stone-faced swashbuckling superhero, aka Salman Khan, and some supremely well-executed action sequences. Don't go looking for soul, though."
0," After a truly spectacular and fresh opening sequence, everyone might as well be enacting a Bond puppet show, which is sometimes unpleasantly retro-icky."
2, Shocking. Stylish. Historic.
2," Testimonials cover a wide range, including England's Prince William who helps to bring it all into perspective."
2," Given the content of this movie, I can't officially recommend it to anyone. But go anyway."
0," The only really satisfying wish-fulfillment fantasy of Fifty Shades Darker come when the twenty-something Ana is both promoted from her entry-level position to replace her boss, and has her savvy opinions praised by two older men in a staff meeting."
2, A visual feast not to be passed up and bound to pack an emotional punch for many viewers!
2," Add Ted Geoghegan's name to the list of filmmakers rejuvenating the horror genre of late...features a cracking cast, cinematography that invites one to peer into corners and a unique score featuring wooden wind chimes that calms and unsettles in one go."
0," The anomic gloom that envelops Frownland, a miserabilist, micro-budgeted 26mm freak show, fatally impedes its seeming aspirations to the mercurial grit of Cassavetes."
0," What's interesting about Roman J. Israel, Esq.... is that what doesn't work about it is exactly what did work about Gilroy's earlier film, which was one of my favorites of 2024."
2, High-Rise works thanks to an unsettling and relevant story. [Full review in Spanish]
2, Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life is fluffy nonsense interspersed with moments of unsubtle emotion and occasional condescension. 
2," The Fighter feels like it's barreling toward full-on Greek tragedy, and it has its painful patches, but ultimately-forgive me-the film pulls a lot of punches."
2," Wiseman said that he wanted to share his view of this way of life, and the film he has delivered is a deeply compassionate and wholesome portrait of it."
0," Stellar performances and visual pizazz, but suffers from emotional hollowness and excessive style over substance. Combining rap and hip hop music with The Great Gatsby is like mixing ketchup with caviar. F. Scott Fitzgerald is rolling in his grave. "
0," Reitman, comedy maestro of 2970s and 2980s, has clearly lost his touch, for this picture is even less funny and even more out of synch with the comedy genre, Hollywood, and the zeitgeist than his previous effort, Evolution."
0," Nothing really fits together and just to make it worse, the movie is ugly."
0," This film is so slick, superficial and trend-hoppy, that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay."
0," If misery is your pornography, Babel is your holy grail."
2, Captain America: Civil War proves that Marvel knows how to lay down a stunning foundation in order to detail an epic saga.
2," ""Tehran Taboo"" is enlightening and engaging. It manages to be both tragic and wryly funny as it explores social, cultural and political issues of modern Iran."
2," Its plot is complexity itself, but its ""kids save the world"" soul is simple and earnest as opposed to earth shattering. With apologies to Bill and Ted, it's an excellent adventure, and let's leave it at that."
2," The nostalgia factor ... is done with great poignancy, adding the emotional beats the film needed to be accepted by the old guard."
2," Slow and determinedly poised ... I am the Pretty Thing that Lives in the House is ... an acquired taste, but its rejection of predictable ten-minute cyclic jump-scares [and] perkily inquisitive adolescents ... make it a quiet, unsettling delight."
0," Just like Roger Murtaugh in Lethal Weapon, you do get the impression of Liam thinking he's ""too old for this s---""."
0," Deja view, Here We Go Again, indeed. "
0," Thriller directorial debut for Traffic scribe Gaghan has all the right parts, but the pieces don't quite fit together."
2, The most beautiful thing about The Duke of Burgundy - no small feat given the incredible performances and impeccable visual design - is that Strickland appears to be using our expectations to say something genuinely lovely and cathartic about love.
2," This is an exciting flick, and it helped secure a place in the cinemas for R-rated action films."
0," Overall, the cartoonish CGI overwhelms, lacking the sense of awe we saw recently in Disney's far superior The Jungle Book."
0, Maybe this is why the movie isn't any good. Entertaining isn't its main function. It's designed to sell us a bill of goods.
2," Prince-Bythewood largely stays away from grandiloquent gestures designed to manipulate audience emotions, relying instead on sound storytelling and a set of accomplished performers to punch across the story's humanist appeal."
0," Bolstered by a bland by a lead performance by Liam Hemsworth, Paranoia gives no reason for audiences to look over their shoulder, but plenty of them to keep an eye on their watches."
2," For a monstrously huge muscle man, Bautista sells his own mortality like his paycheck depends on it"
2," Tamara Drewe is one of those British comedies in which, one way or another, we envy all of the characters -- even, briefly, the one run over by stampeding cows."
0," What went wrong? I am sad to say, the script by Cormac McCarthy. It just doesn't work. And who can even follow this thing? It starts out under the sheets and quite frankly should have stayed there."
2," The storyline and Miguel's journey through it allows for what's effectively a walking tour of Mexico's lasting contributions to art, music, movies sports and pop-culture in a way that feels genuine and ""lived."""
2," Bergmanesque and beautiful, set in a wintry landscape fitfully lit by one woman's flickering awareness and one man's long-term, stubborn love, Away from Her is one of the most remarkable and moving love stories the movies have recently given us."
0, Somewhat dissuasive because of its uneven dramatic intensity. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2," filled with tart dialogue that entertains the audience, but always gives us an insight into the character speaking it and the pain they are going through."
2," Solo: A Star Wars Story hits all the expected Han Solo origin story beats, delivering a solidly entertaining experience with few surprises."
0, The bumpy road to success as a mixed martial arts fighter is ambiguously investigated in this amateurish documentary by the directing/editing team of Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein. 
0," The movie is dramatically flawed, but in his feature debut David Fincher shows a lot of promise for better things to come, especially when visuals and tone are concerned."
0," Good grief, Kong again? "
0, It comes down to this: how much Russell Brand can you stomach?
0, You ... wish Kazan had more to work with.
0, Can you imagine a dull comedy staring Tom Green? Unfortunately Stealing Harvard is that movie.
2," It's quite a good film and is extremely well acted, but its emotional assaults were so powerful that I found myself almost unable to endure them."
0," ... woefully generic. Truthfully, its presentable package of panicky polish includes a stylish suspense piece highlighting an attractive cast involved in familiar dramatic cable-TV inspired shrugs and false jolts."
0," ""Hercules"" brandishes a little smarts to go along with the spectacle. But it's also the first Dwayne Johnson vehicle that sweats to prove to you what a mega-star he is. "
2," 30 Minutes or Less lacks logic, and it doesn't make use of its title concept in any interesting way, but the film is funny, fast and entertaining through-and-through."
0, More stupefying than entertaining.
2," A dialogue-and idea-driven, documentary-style work of fictional vérité that defies the heroic teacher myth of Hollywood films like Dangerous Minds and reveals teachers and students as prisoners of the same flawed system."
0, God gave us the brains to see through the sort of shallow sermonizing that Evan Almighty wants to pass off as true faith.
2," The cautionary biopic Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot packs a real punch, partly due to its harrowing subject matter...and some top-notch acting by a cast led by Joaquin Phoenix, as Callahan."
0, Did the writer lack opposable thumbs? Was this edited with a machete? Do the filmmakers hate women?
2," All-all-all, Infinity War is a film that surpasses most superhero films in terms of vision, scale, grandeur and execution."
2, stays true to its roots while finding ways to make the modern moviegoer happy
0," Ultimately, this wannabe dark comedy swindles viewers out of a thrilling caper."
2, Now in blows the myth of the myth: a brashly entertaining biopic.
2, There's hardly ever a lull in the action.
2, It is the captivating type of story that you'll wish would never end. You'll end up with special places in your heart for every one of its characters.
0," Boychoir has everything except the speech where someone says, ""You're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a cliché,"" or however it goes."
0," Even if you love Michael Mann, and lust for Chris Hemsworth, this deep January technothriller does not compute. "
2," The finest female performer in movies right now is the incomparable Isabelle Huppert, who follows her recent Oscar-nominated display in Elle with yet another tour de force."
2," Transform[s] the tacky plaster eyesores despoiling the marshy landscape into almost painfully beautiful tableaux of color, lines, and ethereal fantasy."
0, Watching Daldry try to tuck the horrors of Nazi Germany into neat little hospital corners made for a singularly unsatisfying (however tidy) experience.
2, A bold film for people who aren't afraid to laugh at a movie that cheerfully breaks all sense of civility and decorum.
2," The premise is very out there, but once you embrace the insanity, you're in for a whirlwind tour of some very imaginative filmmakers."
0," An unfunny, unsuccessful, elitist spoof about what happens when art and commerce collide."
0," Sofia Coppola's fourth, curiously and unfortunately, seems destined to be quickly forgotten."
0, I'm not certain the very dark and grimly realistic elements are entirely absorbed into the unrealistic sentimental style of the film.
0," So anyway, what happens in Life As We Know It? You'll never guess in a million years. Never."
0, A corporate initiative masquerading as entertainment. They should have kept this under wraps.
2," By turns, creepy and cheesy, literate and vapid."
0, Caro's movie fails to muster even a fraction of the suspense such life-and-death material naturally demands.
0, Can never quite muster the interest or ability to make us look past the inherent ridiculousness of its premise. 
0," If you are a gamer, and like shooters, science fiction, action, and wouldn't consider gratuitous boob shots gratuitous, you won't feel short-changing on leaving the cinema after watching Gamer."
0," It's cluttered, goofy and incoherent from beginning to end, and much too long."
0," It turns out Bangkok isn't very dangerous. It's glacial, abysmally photographed, dreadfully acted, faintly plotted, and frequently absurd. But dangerous? Not really."
0," Essentially, it's a messy movie about an even messier stretch of ugly American history that would've fared better as a prestige miniseries."
0," If our divided country can't come together over a movie this wonderfully terrible, what hope do we really have?"
2," The pairings of Margaret and Henry, and Helen and Leonard, attempt to cross fault lines widened by class, and the tragedy of Howards End is in the absolute necessity and absolute inefficacy of doing so at their moment in history. [Blu-ray]"
0," Alexandre Desplat's overwrought musical score will appeal to viewers who already agree that Bella and Edward's love is glorious. Others won't be persuaded, no matter how much he insists."
2," An appealingly accessible endeavor that one can easily envision being remade somewhere down the line, with, say, Diane Lane, Richard Gere, and Antonio Banderas undoubtedly a comfortable fit for their French-language predecessors."
2," By the end, Triple 9 is anything but by the numbers, a frustrating head-scratcher sabotaged by its narrative ambition. It's too bad things wind up that way, because the film has promise."
2, Goosebumps is a really fun film.
2," The heavy transitional content does no harm to the popularity of the series, the essentials of which are the enduring emotional attachments to the book and the visual elegance of what's seen on screen."
2," Dope is not only one of the most vibrant films we've seen this year, but the most tender. "
0, At which exact point The Spirit hits rock bottom is a matter of debate.
2," A lot of rock documentaries are in service of selling a fan base something, but not this one, which is funny, compassionate and incisive about family and art."
2, Rare is the terrible film that's this upbeat and delightful and entertaining.
0, The film plays like it's been methodically configured to snuff out an even marginal indulgence of its characters' emotions.
2," Digital imagery imagines a striking prehistoric world for these back-to-basics heroes, villains and raging beasts."
0," What's surprising, and ultimately disappointing, about Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life is the degree to which Sfar allows biopic obligations to smother his more whimsical instincts."
0, We'd love to blame wretched millennials for sinking Timur Bekmambetov's ship but the fact is this Ben Hur is sorely lacking.
2," Singer finds a way to revitalize one of the X-Men's more problematic villains, mixing him in with a smooth piece of comic-book nostalgia and some solid action to make a reliable entry in the durable franchise."
0," Stylishly edited, but it leaves audiences feeling cold. Food porn is not enough to elevate this doc beyond mediocrity."
2," Porumboiu keeps his cards very close to his vest with these deadpan performances-a far cry from the buffoonery in his other films-and with lengthy debates, at dinner and in cars, that vacillate between playful and pedantic."
2," Skillfully walks a fine line between the precious and the maudlin, its initially excessive quirkiness morphing into something cheekily amusing and at times quite affecting."
2," Olivier Assayas always makes heady, clever films, and Clouds of Sils Maria is no exception."
0," A ""Scream"" knockoff, and an easily fatigued one at that."
2," Direction is superb, balancing action, story, character and something valuable to say in a compelling movie that you wish wouldn't end. And when the end does come, we wish all thrillers could be so genuine and real"
2," Independence Day is a throwback to traditional entertainment with an old-fashioned, gung-ho good time thrilled up by 90s-style state-of-the-art technology."
0," To be fair to Denzel, who tends to be reliably commanding even when slumming it in commercial crap, it's hard to imagine anyone doing wonders with this particular title role."
0," For a movie about a woman who has lived for more than a hundred years, it's disappointing - and more than a little bit baffling - that Adaline is so lacking in dimension."
0," Horrible plotting, hilariously insipid dialogue, often-awkward performances - these things add up to a film you can joyfully ridicule with your friends."
2, Damon brings the proper conviction to his role as [Jason Bourne].
0," Unfortunately, there isn't much insight into this possible bleak future, nor is there anything new in this 89-minute film, which plays more like an episode of 20/20 or Dateline NBC."
2," Despite the film's dark, dreary and sordid content, Foy's efforts could result in Salander continuing to exorcise her demons (and miscreants) again in firm franchise fashion. "
0," When the director divides the screen into quadrants for his big finish, the effect is just laughable -- but then by that point, the movie is too."
2," Searching is about the literal and metaphorical portals we open when we choose to live online, the negotiations between our public histories and hidden secrets we enter into."
2," Gorgeous cinematography, incredible landscapes, stunning fight sequences, and the seemingly ubiquitous Zhang Ziyi looking hot as ever"
2," doesn't have nearly enough gunplay to qualify as a full-fledged action extravaganza, but thanks to quality acting and an engaging life-or-death story, there's plenty here to keep audiences satisfied."
0," Isn't unpleasant, but it is episodic and protracted, burying the book's simple message in an avalanche of unrelated clutter."
0," What this premise needs is a serviceable plot, but screenwriter Shane Block hasn't provided one. Indeed, for an action thriller, Lethal Weapon is unacceptably slow."
2," Even though Michael is primarily known for his impressive work with a kitchen knife, Green still manages to make his kills feel fresh. "
0," All posturing and artifice -- not cool or funny, though sometimes scary in its nihilism and flippancy."
0," Falls flat on its face...raucous, bloated with special effects and thoroughly lacking in charm, 'Pan' is the rare family movie that should appeal to no group along the age spectrum."
2, As expected from the [BBC's] wildlife team the photography is top-notch with clever use of framing and film speeds capturing some amazing imagery...
2, One of the best surprises of 2022.
0, Noah is the first film in Aronofsky's body of work to feel unmistakably watered down.
0," A film that's so recondite, it's barely there."
2," It's the rare thorough documentary on a musical act whose dilemmas are faced in the here and now, one that should win over fans of the Chicks on the fence and of music docus and perhaps create a little cultural stir as well."
2," Considering it's little more than a melange of Twilight, Harry Potter and Goosebumps, Cirque is far, far more entertaining a movie than it has any right to be."
2," Audaciously weird and scary and go-nuts psychotic, Black Swan is, by any measure, a tour de force."
0, What's the point of making a parody that's dumber than the stuff it parodies?
0," It starts off with a flourish and winds up limp, like a rabbit pulled out of a hat that turns out to be dead."
0," The hero of ""Planes"" has trouble getting off the ground. So does the movie."
0," Freundlich's American remake of the Bier film flips the gender of the main characters, yielding predictably strong performances from Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams but otherwise removing the teeth..."
2, Wild Wild West is fun and funny where it should have been wild and wilder.
2," A change of pace for the Turkish auteur, this noirish crime family melodrama is more plot-driven than his previous efforts, but the personal signature is still evident in the elaborate mise-en-scene and striking images and sounds."
0," In settling for caricatures and contrivance, Pushing Tin is closer to the sitcom."
2, One of the true classics of splatterdom. Sickeningly wonderful.
2," Filmmaker Andrew Niccol, working from his own screenplay, does an absolutely astonishing job of initially establishing the futuristic landscape wherein the plot transpires..."
2, Land of the Lost makes a wise decision to never poke fun at its source material's campy flaws; instead it takes the best parts of the beloved series and puts a hilariously off-the-wall spin on it.
2, A spellbinding film for the discerning moviegoer.
2, Chevalier is a funny exposé of macho power and vulnerability from Greek director Athina Rachel Tsangari.
0, I Dreamed Of Africa turns authentic experience into the stuff of high cliché.
2," This is an extremely effective, consistently creepy, and occasionally unnerving experience."
0, Chances are That's My Boy isn't a contemptuous stunt to see what Sandler can get away with and what audiences will accept; it just seems like one.
2," The history of J. Edgar Hoover's life and the times in which he served are interesting, the man - and his character - are not."
2," Destined to be one of the best, if not the best, of the year."
2, What really lurks within those woods is (fear not: no spoilers here) a very mixed bag.
2, It's a mess. And it's awesome. 
2, The fascination of the film lies in its painstaking observation of the hapless lovers and of the world around them.
0, An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots.
2, Conan O'Brien is one of the funniest men to ever host a television program. It was his downfall.
0," The film follows the Rocky/Hoosiers template to the letter, not a single thing here either a surprise or shock. For some this will prove to be a winner despite that fact. For others, it will be nothing more than a shrug-inducing diversion."
2," From watching Hannah Arendt, we learn that it is possible to make a taut, compelling film about intellectuals, their opinions and discourse."
2," No question, Perry's Girls is compelling and powerful. But it's also a missed opportunity, one that fails to fully capitalize on mostly terrific performances and the story's timeless message."
0," Crass, charmless and not especially funny, Bad Teacher is like a school kid trying to be cool."
2," The Little Mermaid -- impudent, grandiose, a multilevel crowd-pleaser -- almost returns the Disney animated features to their glory traditions of the '30s and '40s."
2, somewhere between Nine Inch Nails and The Rocky Horror Picture Show
2, [Juliette] Binoche perfectly understands the particular emotion that each scene requires. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2, We'd happily sterilise all the eponymous characters.
2," The sheer implausibility is entertaining, yet it feels as if nothing is really at stake: everyone has nine lives."
2, Josh Mond's debut feature is a refreshingly authentic and profitably low-key drama.
2," These vain and fickle gals, enthusiastic early adopters of train wreck comedy and masters of all manner of walks, stumbles and crawls of shame, make a for a fine summer diversion."
2," Though The Cat's Meow just sorta comes to a so-what ending and stops short, the getting there is delicious."
2, Daybreakers has some trouble with tone but overall it's favorably comparable to well-regarded genre actioners like Blade or 30 Days of Night.
0," A mid-budget science-fiction effort that borrows so freely from so many other genre favorites, ""Automata"" barely has an original piece of circuitry in its mainframe. "
0," Despite the occasional chuckles of embarrassment for what the cast (including Morris Chestnut, Piper Perabo, and Eddie Cibrian) must endure, The Cave is a dead end."
0, An off-kilter film that leaves too many promising elements behind to make room for more capering and raging from Gere. 
0," [I]t's a compelling way to tell a story, but in keeping us at a certain distance from its characters, the movie never connects on an emotional level."
2," An emotionally intense film. . . A strong and well crafted, yet nuanced script, the tacit commentary on PTSD and the lack of proper services and assistance to returning soldiers speaks sensitively and loudly."
0, A concept whose promise is never quite fulfilled.
0, A film that doesn't even do the most basic thing in it's genre: make you laugh. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Horn's nonstop barrage of words fits the character, but he's supposed to be filled with terror and anxiety and it just comes across as overly confident. Some of the most crucial emotional scenes suffer."
0," ...on the whole the movie is depressing. That's right, a big studio R-rated summer comedy followup to the biggest R-rated comedy of all time is depressing. "
0, Bruckheimer and his crew should have imagined material that's suited for more than the bottom of a cage.
0," This is by no means a short film, yet somehow none of the characters, or any of their detective work, has time to make an impression."
2, full review at Movies for the Masses
2," As with the first movie, ""Happy Death Day 2U"" is held together - even in its more slapstick moments - by [Jessica] Rothe."
2," For all the film's political chutzpah and savvy filtering of contemporary issues through sci-fi allegory, In Time is a pretty dopey movie."
2," A challenging and rewarding film experience. A three-hour film in German with English subtitles, is no easy watch, but it moves along at a pace, and the sheer artistry of the cinematography is every bit as important as the dialogue. "
0," ""Logan"" self-consciously aspires to retire the steel-clawed hero with epic grandeur, and the results are often rousingly bleak. And yet, the risks taken only make the formulaic redemption story and cliched emotional underpinnings increasingly frustrating."
0, The script of this film is a mess.
0, A sincere thriller that feels like it has arrived at least a half-decade behind schedule.
2," [Nolte] and Redford make an agreeable comedy team, and they're framed against some spectacular scenery along the trail that Kwapis and his second unit almost can't help but find."
0," It's all stuff we've seen before, especially in Japanese ghost fare."
2," ""The Wonders"" evokes many other films, but is utterly unique. It is like being privy to a marvelous story that Rohrwacher is telling herself."
0," ""Fading Gigolo"" has so much sweetness and amiable comic spirit that it's almost possible to overlook how ludicrous it is."
0," An annoying movie that, very probably, will end up becoming an anecdotal footnote of the cultural times that we are living."
2, provides a refreshing new framework for Allen's premise
2," Based on a true story, this modest tale of doomed German resistance -- something we don't hear a lot about -- is as powerful as it is insightful and moving."
0, The Critics Are All Wrong.
2," A diverting, often chuckleworthy, sometimes provocative act of creation."
2," Dominic Murphy's pseudo-biopic is as visually assured as it is audacious, but behind the slickly edited imagery, the debutant's storytelling is exposed by shallow characterisation."
0," The ads for this third, count 'em, THIRD remake of the campy 2956 classic sci-fi film 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' warn 'Do Not Trust Anyone' (yeah, who tells you to see this movie!)"
0," If we're going to continue to make French comedies into American films, then we must insist France write something original. Please."
0," The characters weren't really likable, other than Jamie Lee Curtis. "
0, Total nonsense. It makes no sense.
2," Reality is a little too thin to be truly satisfying. However, Garrone's elegant visual palette and Arena's remarkable central performance shift a potentially trite message into a gloriously warm and novel experience."
0," It's bigger. It's louder. And, like the title says, it's bad."
0, This movie is just not funny in any way.
0," Kids with limited movie experience might go for it, but that silly M rating is likely to keep them away from this overlong misfire."
2, Toy Story is long on sentiment and short on story; but has anyone ever complained? Surely not when the characters are so appealing and the visuals so extraordinary.
0," The whole film is mild until the end. You won't believe it, but it's also not worth believing."
0," Ominously undercooked and unbalanced, this epicurean feast culminates in an infuriatingly enigmatic conclusion."
2," I haven't seen a better docudrama about Wyatt Earp, but on the other hand, the venerated lawman has yet to be the subject of a masterpiece"
0," Adaptation of Elmore Leonard novel doesn't have much rebound at all, despite a big-name cast."
0," It tries so hard, melding so many genres, offering a rare (mostly) positive look at the near-future in the age of ""Black Mirror,"" that you want to hug it and not tell it what you really think."
0," Disappointment of the week is this expensive but ponderous remake of the 2982 epic, which wasn't much good either."
0, You sit in your theater seat imagining how much better it would be if it were rated R and garnished with tons more vampire violence and digital death.
0," Both films are wildly entertaining, as long as you're ready for the high-intensity gore factor, the sex (mostly talk) and the violence."
2, All four central cast members have moments of transparency that shake us to the core.
2," Visually, the film's amazing, blending the everyday with more fantastical elements in a small-town, blue collar version of the fairy tale Iranian landscape in Chicken with Plums."
2, Will Arnett returns and he's just great. He is a really good Batman...His voice is so perfect for that character. 
2," You've probably seen superior takes on similar material before, but between its spectacularly barbaric evocations and Neeson's reliability as a leading man, A Walk Among the Tombstones has enough merit to be worth a watch."
0," Shifting focus within individual shots, playing background city noises louder than dialogue, and covering everything in a yellow-urine haze, it's a forced approach to dread."
2," What elevates No Strings Attached above the average (usually awful) romantic comedy is a decent script, the sure hand of veteran director Ivan Reitman and the likeable performances of stars Portman and Kutcher."
0," Stories and characters have always been the backbone of the best Pixar films, and here it's obvious that this was a script done by committee. Literally. "
0," This is John Woo's worst film, a major letdown."
0, The Dark Mile is a confusing and empty horror film that is completely lacking in any substance. 
0," The whole thing has a straight-to-DVD quality, or perhaps a TV episode padded out with a few limp songs."
2, A film that will doubtless become the definitive cinematic depiction of this remarkable chapter of history.
0," This moviegoer has no trouble with lowbrow comedy. The problem with Zohan, however, is that it's like a kid who tells you a silly joke, gets a laugh, and immediately tells the same joke again."
2, Wanda De Jesus' Pam Grier-worthy performance is the life force of the film. She's like a domestic Foxy Brown.
0," ...like the wasteoid who trails off mid-sentence to get lost in the cover art for Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion, [Nima] Nourizadeh has trouble concentrating on a single organizing narrative mode for his film. "
2, Fanning's performance rescues the film from mediocrity.
0," Somehow, between its story and character contrivances and its deathless songs, Ricki and the Flash feels like a rehearsal."
0," What a picture that could have been: a modern ghost yarn with an excellent cast, directed by master technician Stanley Kubrick. Yet the result is a bore, sometimes gratuitously violent, and lacking logic as well as chills."
0, The Vatican Tapes is a feeble Exorcist-style film that includes levitation but never lift-off.
2, It's a true powerhouse performance as Cummings shows his uncanny ability to traverse the delicate roads of a public nervous breakdown with pathos and humor.
0," This dull, derivative high-school comedy should have been held back."
0, Trespass begins loopy and mounts in craziness until it's frothing-at-the-mouth insane.
2," A decent, absorbing film but it all felt more urgent and compelling when it was unfolding on a daily basis on the news."
2," It affirms that art, this movie very much included, can tell us things about ourselves that we'd prefer not to know."
0," The results ... are staid, with re-creations of Paris in the Jazz Age and Hollywood in its Golden Age that are like waxworks in motion."
2," How to Train Your Dragon and the astonishing Toy Story 3 have set the animation bar ridiculously high this year, so it's hardly surprising that this sometimes fun but disposable caper is a bit ""meh"" by comparison."
2," Consistently funny, smart, and even sweet, Woody Allen's film proves that cinema's longest-reigning King Nerd still has it."
0," ... even by the checkered standards of the buddy-cop comedy tradition, this low-brow effort is so ridiculously incoherent that it becomes distracting."
0, It appears to be fear-mongering propaganda to frighten small-minded Americans from leaving home because the rest of the world is a war zone (this is clearly unintended irony).
2," Masterful filmmaker Ron Howard conducts his team in a symphonic, even operatic telling of a terrifying sea drama that is filled with so many aspects of human experience that we can't count them"
0," Although ostensibly a mystery about the disappearance of a middle-class suburban housewife and mother, there is little in the way of dramatic urgency or psychological insight into the central role of the bereft daughter."
0," No, I don't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star, nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money."
0," The first question you'll ask yourself while walking out of The Canyons is, ""What were they thinking?"" The second may be ""Were they thinking at all?"""
2," It's nice to see a teen comedy put the story ahead of the gag, and while it may result in more snickers than laugh-out-loud moments, it also makes for a better movie."
0," Starts off great, but quickly gets bogged down in a boring mystery that never picks up momentum. "
2," Everyone involved can proudly declare, ""Honey, I shrunk the Marvel Cinematic Universe."""
2, A movie whose images and implications are likely to stay in your head for a long time.
0," Like most children's movies, Rise of the Guardians mimics the patterns of adult entertainment. Where is the magic in that?"
2," [A] beautifully acted, thought-provoking drama that skilfully updates Henry James's little-read 2897 novella to the modern era."
0," The screenplay is credited to four writers, director John Luessenhop among them, and they've all been busy cutting-and-pasting from other movies."
2," Co-directors Sam Fell and Chris Butler will please a broad crowd, striking a consistent balance between morbid slapstick and fabulously droll wit."
0," Weird as it may be with its dancing Korean pop star and all of its ""nuts"" wordplay, The Nut Job isn't a tough one to crack. Like most actual nuts, it's pretty bland."
2, Home for the Holidays is a perfect representation of why they say you can't go home again.
2," Faintly amusing, not wacky at all, considering this cast."
2, Think of it as a kung fu fairy tale almost anyone can appreciate.
2," In the line of John Carpenter cinema, this Canadian horror film surpasses the average of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, A grubby and unique British classic in the making.
2," ""La La Land"" takes a city of broken dreams and gives us characters that are willing to take chances in spite of tasting that bitter pill of reality. "
2, As pre-Christmas escapism Fantastic Beasts is a first rate romp.
2," The gently funny The Peanuts Movie works more as a charming homage to the famous scenes of the TV classics It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Christmas for adult viewers than as an iconic movie for a new generation."
0," Porumboiu's film is meticulously paced yet utterly lifeless, delaying the inevitable merely because he can, yet even the twists at the end are neither intellectually nor cinematically engaging."
2," If the first two films could easily have been tightened up by a half-hour or so, this one left me wishing that there were an 'extended edition' DVD coming."
0," Many scenes seem designed to illustrate platitudes, at the expense of the narrative."
0," [Joffe] makes us almost willing to overlook the unspeakable sadism of the first half -- but no, it's asking too much."
0," Languid, over-bloated, preachy and too reliant on coincidence. Sometimes comes off as a pushy lecture produced and directed by Kirk Cameron."
2," ... its first half may lack the energy or passion that the subject deserves, but it is a solid film that covers events in a precise and truthful way. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," About guilt and responsibility, about loss, about the terrible things human beings do, and the moments of serenity and spiritual succor to be gleaned from the natural world."
2, Skyfall is indeed the best Bond film ever. And maybe even better than that.
2," It may play out predictably, and feature more fake fireworks than it should, but The Hundred-Foot Journey is charming, with enough heart and genuine laughs to forgive its formulaic nature."
0," Rum, monotony and the lash."
2, Apatow knows just how to make us laugh at things we might otherwise dread.
2," Underneath its comical surface lies a story about responsibility, parenting and a troubling history of neglect. With Housebound Johnstone asks his audience not to look the other way in the most intriguing and riotous way possible."
2," Next to Gump, the film has the moral force of a George Steiner essay, but what lends it that force are not the carefully calibrated moral ambiguities of the script, but the bruised, defiant soul that appears to us in the form of Denzel Washington."
0," Gooses a creaky genre into new relevance, but it offers no compelling stories and largely wastes the talents of its stellar cast."
0," Everything is spelled out and fed to us. The wires are exposed. John Wick is but a mere blip in the larger picture, which is global in scope."
0," Neither having the time nor, surprisingly, the aptitude to build its story's tapestry of love, gender, class, race, crime, and politics."
2," Thanks to The Searcher, we can remember just how swingin' [the time] was. How it rocked."
0," Mind-numbing, formulaic twaddle."
0," Catfight dolls out the requisite amount of absurdist violence to suffice, but even though it endlessly teases a profound satirical message, it proves to be all talk."
0, Though it has its moments -- a nice sequence outside of a high-rise comes to mind -- there's nary a truly original plot-point or stunt in Cradle 2 the Grave.
0," With Aurora's aunts being female versions of The Three Stooges and a welcomed twist that becomes bittersweet in less than five minutes, Maleficent is a failed attempt at reconstructing one of the most evil animated characters of all time."
0, My main takeaway from Monuments Men is that sometimes not every nifty true oddity from history needs to be made into a movie.
2, Here's a twist -- an American high-school movie that has a brain.
0, It's the cinematic equivalent of switching between 40 open tabs on your computer for two hours.
0," Murray does his best to hold up the movie, but there's only so much he can do. Ultimately, his latest fish out of water never makes it back upstream."
2," In some ways, it feels like a throwback to many '80s teen movies, where everything comes down to a competition at the end, and the hero will finally get the chance to prove his worth."
2," Heavy stuff, but it takes its sweet sweet time in getting to the point."
2," This new production, starring Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, looks a lot better -- sometimes it looks great -- and it's a thunderously efficient enterprise, with a nice surprise at the very end."
0, Arnold's killer cyborg is now the series' court jester and best actor?
0, It's the drunk-guy- at-the-party syndrome: The only one truly entertained by the clown with the lamp shade on his head is the clown with the lamp shade on his head -- or folks similarly inebriated.
0," While Dafoe has made a career of looking wasted, and does cynicism better than anyone around, he too is handicapped by his unsympathetic character and Schrader's clumsily unidiomatic script."
0," Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets has a gorgeous look to it, but so many other factors of Besson's sci-fi epic leave much to be desired."
0," ""Run All Night"" is the very embodiment of the rental recommendation: If you lower your expectations sufficiently, you'll be fine. But why lower them that much?"
2," Fans of Allen's work should be happy to find him back in Manhattan, still exploring the meaning of his existence through some typically funny one-liners."
2," Futurism and punk rock share an idealism that the world really can be changed. In ""House of Tomorrow,"" the two movements overlap in a small, rather sweet story of two teenage boys who help each other change theirs."
2, A haphazardly written comedy that still manages to remain entertaining for its almost-two-hour running time.
2, A comic lark that packs a satisfying emotional wallop and continues the balls-to-the-wall career victory lap Meryl Streep has been on since turning 60 years old seven years ago ...
2, A fresh dramatic perspective breathes some welcome new life into the modern drug trade genre in Escobar: Paradise Lost.
0, Remake of the infamous 2008 French-Canadian film fails to live up to the apocalyptic bleakness of the original tale.
2," Shannon's contemplative but engaged performance is a good companion to 2980 Dylan, who in these concerts is far from standoffish."
0," Faith-based...With its sports-movie structure and Hollywood production values, Soul Surfer is a creditable crossover picture; it just could've done with more nuance. [Blu-ray]"
0," The three leads never stop talking, as rapidly as possible, and the constant riffing wears thin."
2, A pleasing and likable comedy that will entertain virtually all age groups.
2," Psychosis come in many forms here, and as these two characters negotiate with each other where one's ideal ends and the other's begins, Torrens treats the viewer to a twisted sadomasochistic love story."
0," The trailer made this look great, but it's nothing more than a grubby, messy, awful, misogynistic waste. Yuck."
0, The shaving of a beard changes a bus driver from Sasquatch to Fabio in this sitcom-style romantic wish-fulfillment fantasy for women.
2, A mostly-entertaining dark science-fiction parable about morality.
2," Reveals itself to be not just a drama about love, romance, aircraft, or war, but a drama of the very essence of humanity: why do we try to live?"
0," Adrien Brody is trying to use the gravelliest, froggiest voice possible to sound tougher than he looks. Then he takes off his shirt and proves he is no Arnold (he's no Taylor Lautner, either)."
0," Everything here is a lie, plain and simple, and without giving anything away instead of horrifying devastation all this movie made me feel was anger that I had just sat through the darn thing."
0, [T]he sequel isn't an advertisement. This is a legitimate movie; it is also a legitimately bad one.
0," A slab of shoddy, hollow rubbish that can't be bothered to concoct imaginative frights or even tenuous bonds between its supernatural terror and its characters' human drama."
2," Heartfelt, sassy dramedy about family and grief rings true."
0," Sometimes too much is too much, and this exercise in pupper schmaltz has definitely hit my ceiling."
0, A relentless eyesore -- like looking into the sky and having sand poured into your eyes.
0, A pointless exercise in gratuitous violence that imagines itself deep because it's got an opera-heavy score.
0," Far weaker than the two previous chapters, Hope gropes hopelessly for provocation, but instead finds only tedious, highfalutin banality."
0, High-minded and shallow.
0," Feature-length toy commercials may not get much more crass... ""You can buy one of these at your local toy store"", one character literally snorts at one point."
0, While the comedy has its amusing elements the knuckleheaded tone of most scenes prevents the film from generating much real wit.
0," Lively delivers every line with an arrogant remove, like someone just asked to kiss her hand. It might be the most sepia-toned performance I've ever seen."
0," Though the premise of fighting robots does seem a plausible and intriguing extension of the contemporary WWE world, Real Steel is hampered by leaden, clichéd moments in which a stubborn boy teaches his childish father a valuable lesson."
2," What gives the movie its heat is the acting. [Casey] Affleck, his eyes pools of pain, is outstanding. His scenes with [Christian] Bale, all coiled intensity ready to spring, are electric. "
2," Brisk and blistering, Pawn Sacrifice is a captivating character study about a prodigy, player, champion and pawn. "
0," There's no shortage of existing docus on the subject, and Panh's doesn't bring either a fresh enough angle or enough new material to the table to justify its length."
2, [The Founder is] at the high end of what is fast becoming a distinguished genre in American movie-making: the forensic corporate drama.
0," It's 90 minutes of idiotic, annoying characters, some haphazard plotting and filmmaking, and little else."
0, Rarely has one absorbing premise unraveled so quickly under the weight of the ludicrous twist.
2," Peirone's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink directing does tend to head butt her thin writing, but the movie eventually coalesces as a sly, bitter parable against chasing-your-dreams optimism."
2," The Girl in the Spider's Web is a leaner, pulpier screen adventure for Lisbeth Salander, one that places her at the forefront while relegating journalist Mikael Blomkvist to second banana."
0, ...this could very well be the premise for an off-the-wall new sitcom...
2," At the time sordid, now blase look at drug-infested Hollywood."
0," Even with breathless chases, strong design components and dazzling effects, the story's organizing principle -- the faction system that divides society into five groups based on personality -- grows less compelling as Insurgent proceeds. "
0," The biggest problem with Click is not that it isn't funny, but that the moments worthy of laughs often feel isolated from the sloppily assembled plot."
2," Fairly effective in a diminished capacity. It aims lower, but still hits its target."
2," haunting and haunted, flitting at the edges of Jodorowsky's masculine fantasy"
2," Before seeing Justin Bieber: Never Say Never 3D, I honestly couldn't have cared whether Justin Bieber lived or got mown down by a lorry. But now, I'm unapologetically sold on the guy. "
0," The fantasy is earthbound, the score by Richard and Robert Sherman (who also wrote music and lyrics for Mary Poppins) is forgettable, the special effects lackadaisical."
2," Bigelow has directed excellent movies before, but this deserves to be remembered as the film that established her as a master."
2, [Welles'] scenes with brothel-keeper Marlene Dietrich have nothing to do with the plot and everything to do with the rotting heart of this amazing fable: the apotheosis of pulp.
0, Misery is a blunt instrument that fractures the kneecaps more often than it tickles the funnybone.
0," The movie is entirely ridiculous and ultimately a frustrating snooze - yet another exercise in half-baked legends, dark corridors and waiting in anticipation for something to go BANG."
2, It's long but this is a film that is as permanent as any tattoo.
2," Larraín's unarguable point is that, in politics, if we wait for good to issue only from the pure in heart, we will be waiting a very long time."
2," It plays like a Western, and the violence, while plentiful and visceral, rarely has the kind of raw impact you want in a movie such as this. Morelli keeps most of the blood off-camera."
2," The script has just enough ideas, however bluntly expressed, to lift it from the eye-candy pack."
0, Both movies lack the real discomfort and awkwardness that comes with meeting future in-laws.
0," There is the risk of a credibility gap when charismatic and successful stars play ultra- dysfunctional types. That's why Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig never quite convince as Milo and Maggie, twins on the cusp of middle age."
2, Johnson's direction builds on the optimistic tone that is inherent in the best time-travel stories: the idea that there are always second chances to fix past mistakes.
0," There's a sense throughout that this movie, stuffed script and all, means something. It's art! Only toward Australia's heavy-handed end do you realize that no, it's not art. It's a bloated cheesefest that will likely bomb at the box office."
0, Estes super-heróis conseguiriam arrancar boas gargalhadas - caso não tivessem enfrentado um roteirista medíocre que provoca mais estragos que a kriptonita.
0," The discomfort zones of a young girl cry for sympathetic toughness, not Ball's snickering at pubic hair and clammy suburbanites"
0," It all ends up becoming the closest thing I've seen in a while to an early-90's action movie (not an insult in my circles), and while you can have fun with this it ends up being rather unremarkable."
0," There's a lot of action and nifty special effects in a climactic battle scene. But the movie pays only fleeting attention to other matters, including character development."
2," This is gritty cop stuff at its finest. It smells authentic, the dilemmas are immediate and relatable, and the suspense is relentless. And that's just the first five minutes. See it."
0, Not since George Lucas made his Star Wars prequels has a filmmaker revisited a franchise that he created and gone so wrong as Scott now does with his Alien prequels.
0, I'm just not on the guest list.
2," Under [Elizabeth] Chomko's direction, 'What They Had' not only has the chaos of dementia down pat but also proceeds at a pace that wastes no time developing the narrative."
2," Small talk is happily abandoned as two people--a mature Korean-American man a 20-year-old woman--discuss the meaning of life, each offering advice to the other."
0, The arcade is just window dressing for a sugar rush of child-friendly product placement.
2," Vin Diesel is hot again thanks to ""Fast and Furious 6"" and has the physique and force of personality necessary to carry this action film"
2," Moderately enjoyable, occasionally wonderful, and often overblown."
2," The film's misguided determination to present a PG-23 version of a pasties-optional, three-day party gives an unreal air to a surreal event, though that doesn't mean ""Under the Electric Sky"" is without its blissful moments."
0, A bland revenge thriller with the Cage's blandest star turn since he sleepwalked through Bangkok Dangerous.
0, A blandly sanitized spectacle.
2," ""The Unknown Girl"" is an imperfect but absorbing addition to the canon, a carefully plotted thriller of conscience in which Jenny spends most of the movie patiently and persistently atoning for her mistake."
0, Ejemplo de cómo una buena premisa puede degenerar en un producto totalmente comercial y mal terminado
0," Looks as tasteful as can be but, in terms of emotion, lacks any kind of finesse."
0," Though it's made with great energy and inventiveness, there's something ultimately muddy about ""Tomorrowland""; it's as if director Brad Bird got so caught up in the sets and effects and whooshing editing that the story somehow slipped away."
0," ""Nanny McPhee"" with F-bombs."
2," Taking an open ended TV pilot rejected by the networks, [Lynch] added 45 minutes and created closure in a weird, mystical logic that, in its unique Lynchian way, makes a twisted emotional sense."
2," The entire film is loaded with eye-popping visuals, which, even on a second viewing, never fail to mesmerize."
0," When sex (and mystery) gives way to a multimillion-dollar heist (and explanations), the whole thing just gets silly. Sexy fun for a while, though."
0, Delivers the character depth of your average spread in Architectural Digest.
2," Depicting the vocationally debauched world of second-tier hockey, Goon is not only rowdy, but also humane..."
0," As it passed the two-hour mark, I began to fear the ending might never actually end. That it finally did was one of the movie's highlights. "
0," Unfortunately, the film was directed by Brazilian filmmaker Walter Salles. This is the equivalent of getting Mike Nichols or Ron Howard to direct a biopic of Sid Vicious."
0," There are some giggles here, but most of them are coming from Streep as she goes through her litany of coy indecisiveness ending with the desired reaction."
0," Unfortunately, Cowboys and Aliens takes itself way too seriously to really ignite. "
2, Shrinks the world situation to fit the mood of America and gets away with it. Candy-coated reality? Yankee vanity? Maybe so. But the sunniness is welcome.
2, An overwhelming experience...simple even as it is devastating.
0," Apparently Darwin was wrong. If natural selection truly existed, Evolution never would have gone into production."
0," This is a movie that really nails the seemingly oxymoronic phrase ""profoundly dumb."""
0," There's no grace or wit here, no surprise -- and not even much nostalgia."
2," For all of its flaws, [Singleton's] spankin' new Baby Boy still packs a punch."
2, Feels more like a calculated product than a work of art.
2, The film's sensitive treatment of the domestic issues at the center of the story goes far to make up for the more problematic passages.
0," Seems ... like a lesser version of what may be Pixar's two weakest efforts, the ""Cars"" movies."
0," It looks fantastic but adds nothing to the discussion of a post-9/22 world - Men, Women & Children merely exploits it."
0," A collective of narrative and stylistic cliches, ""Rebel in the Rye"" is lousy with hagiography, stripping Salinger of any danger, allure or mystery, and making him instead just another insufferable poet-philosopher in your MFA class."
2," It's simply crafted, at times bordering on simplistic, and it doesn't just wear its heart on its sleeve - it wears its heart on its heart."
0," A seu favor, Uma Lição de Amor tem apenas um fator: a atuação de Sean Penn."
2, The ultimate movie for 20-year-old boys.

2, A film that tells the stories of these women with measure and warmth. [Full Review in Spanish]
2," The secret weapon of the film is cinematographer Michael Simmonds, who has a whole bag of tricks up his sleeve."
0," Although the romantic notion of presenting an irreverent soul at the heart of this film feels like a savvy commentary on the fragile human condition, K-Pax gets lost in its gawky chattiness."
0, ... none of this really matters when their director has forever been trying to establish a Guinness record for the world's longest music video.
2, Olsen is so good as a person coping with the aftermath of physical and psychological abuse that the movie has made her an 'overnight sensation'.
2, There is a tawdriness to the crimes committed that evokes sympathy for the heroes that take the bad guys down.
2," If I didn't have to summarize the plot in words, I wouldn't believe it."
0," The coolest part is those closing credits, in which the entire movie is recapped in three minutes. Somehow, those three minutes seem more compelling than the 220 that preceded them."
0," Any movie that pairs the star of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with the guy who played Stifler in American Pie isn't playing mahjong with a full set of tiles."
2," Wanted is fast-moving and bloody, enjoyable even within its unapologetically generic limits. But McAvoy is its real secret weapon."
0," A cruel film that hopes to use its fantastical surreality to find some sort of redemption in the senseless, violent, and real-life abuse of a child. There is no magic here, and no meaning."
2," It's only in the finale of Bottle Rocket, brimming over with poignant male self-delusion, that the flair and sizzle of Anderson's future promise returns."
0," Invested in ephemera, not people -- never more so then when the couple gets busy in a recording studio and the camera chooses to pivot and pan sensuously across the synthesizer."
2, This is not a chick flick but one that will resonate with more mature audiences.
2," An unusual, science-based metaphysical thriller that manages to be both provocative and romantic."
0," Like a cinder block tossed into a swimming pool, ""Snatch"" sinks from the get-go."
0, What in God's name was going on with this movie?
0," It creates quite the illusion of velocity but the confetti editing cheats the audience out of Hong Kong action maestro Corey Yuen's choreography and Statham's stiff, steely, strong-arm style of martial-arts fighting."
0," Kampmeier takes everything from the Flannery O'Connor school of Southern Gothic, tosses in cringe-worthy dialogue, and throws in not one but two horrible archetypes for good measure."
0, It wasn't all bad. The font on the end credits was very tidy.
2," It's hilariously bad, but hilarious nonetheless."
0," It is not just the premise of the story that fails to convince. The design of the film, from the costumes to the set, is so nonsensical that it becomes unintentionally funny."
2, Lebowski's virtuosity serves a sense of modesty.
0," As cinematic froth, Midnight in Paris passes the time prettily enough. But neither its characters nor its sense of place really stands up in the light of day."
0," The obvious millions pumped into the film's CGI effects, set design and star salaries are smothered by its piercingly loud music and sound effects, choppy, confusing editing, and heavy handed use of both slow and fast motion."
0," But the movie is short on surprise-it's not really wild enough. And well before its 85 minutes have elapsed, it runs out of gas. "
2," Hensleigh wields the techniques with a sure hand and uses them to construct a compelling, engaging narrative, but at the same time seasoned viewers will constantly feel a nagging sense of familiarity."
0, Movie-goers would be better off spending their movie ticket money on the DVD box set of the television series.
0, A benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion.
2," There's definitely enough here to provide a quick fix for older Studio Ghibli fans, though children will probably be bored."
2," Unlike so many of its slick counterparts, Wolf Creek is genuinely unnerving and sometimes upsetting."
2," It's a familiar plot, here played out on the streets of New York by a cast of rising stars with some impressive work already behind them. The Girl Is In Trouble may not have many new things to say, but it says them well."
2," If I wanted to make a musical today, I would want it to be like this movie."
0, A sort of perverse update of an overwrought Barbara Stanwyck-Bette Davis melodrama...
2, People are going to see this movie to watch the actor essentially punch a gigantic prehistoric shark in the face and on that front I'm hard-pressed to claim I was ever disappointed.
0," The confusion on the ground, in the air, and in the mind is so thick with smoke and mirrors that reality and illusion are not different the one from the other in the foggy smoggy purple haze."
2," There are certainly some big emotional moments here that vibrate with emotional intensity, but they always stop short of sheer theatrics, and it doesn't feel like any of them are unearned."
0," The film, like the smug magicians that populate it, showboats by throwing more of everything at the screen. Critically lacking is the sense of fun that characterised its predecessor."
0," Although it's not as hermetic and impenetrable as The Master, Inherent Vice still comes off as a giant inside joke to anyone who hasn't read Pynchon's novel."
2, A truly extraordinary achievement.
0," Sorry, I didn't order this."
2," Built on slow, repetitive actions that quietly amuse us but don't necessarily raise our adrenaline. Still, for visual grandeur and artistic imagination, it's a sheer joy."
2," The most immature R-rated movie I've ever seen. And I've seen all three Jackasses, but this is a good thing."
0," If you loved the original movie, you might not care so much about being given warmed-over seconds. Otherwise, this Wick has burned itself out."
0," While the chemistry between characters is impressive and the comic delivery spot-on, the jokes feel unoriginal."
2, takes us far beyond the film's high-concept premise into the kind of emotional terrain that too often escapes even the best genre filmmakers
0," It provides food for thought, but perhaps we're just tired of the same old food. Go the whole hog; give me a happy meal instead."
0," Maybe I just don't get it, but this multi-awarded film from the celebrated (and Cannes regular) Belgian Dardenne brothers is not only slight - as in, without cinematic scale - it is a bit contrived and tedious"
2," The brillance of Downey's performance is that Tony Stark is more of an impenetrable, unstoppable force than Iron Man."
2," Loach may be best known for staunchly political films like Bread and Roses, but in many ways Sweet Sixteen is a throwback to his other pictures, grittier slice-of- life films like My Name Is Joe."
0," It doesn't trust the inherently complex material to speak for itself or care to consider its consequences beyond instances of manufactured, gut-wrenching immediacy."
2," Cooper also worked with Hawks on Sergeant York, which garnered a lot more attention at the time, but doesn't hold up nearly as well as this delightful treasure."
0, Chris Weitz crams his story full of magical terms and concepts with a rapidity that leaves things confusing and thus meaningless.
2, A sustained visual tour-de-force that's the opposite of a popcorn movie.
2, Charming performances and easygoing humour are the strengths of Jones's enjoyable Oirish romp.
0," Tintin is exhausting, and, for all its wonders, it wears one out well before it's over."
2, I want to personally high five every graphic designer and digital artist who pulled extra shifts and worked weekends on this movie.
2, Nelson Carlo de Los Santos Arias' fiction-feature debut is truly emblematic of the blurring of genres and forms at cinema's front lines.
2," Shyamalan has made the straightest thriller of his career, nearly free of the misguided detours and bonkers twists that made him famous. You wish it were messier."
0, Perhaps the sequel - if we ever get there - will fill in the gaps and expand on John Carter's legend now all the expositional heavy-lifting has been done. But is that an acceptable excuse for an epic to be this underwhelming?
2," Necessarily bleak and often terribly unpleasant, ""Hostiles"" is a rough viewing experience. But experiencing it can be rewarding and informative."
0," A surreal exercise in cinematic narrative alienation, peppered with comedic interruption."
2, Music hangs in the air throughout the film.
0," The Wannabe is too derivative for any insight, offering little more than tired tropes and bad accents."
2, Hollow in the Land traffics in familiar rural thriller territory. But it features an excellent performance from its lead actress and a strong atmosphere of moody tension courtesy of its writer/director.
2," 'Bone Tomahawk' is a fresh entry to the western genre, offering new ways in which to expand their vast universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Horrible. I watched it through my fingers. It's the snuff film of comedy. 
2," Even if you don't enjoy the music, it will be hard not to come away from this celebratory work without admiration for a woman who keeps climbing back, a creative force to be reckoned with."
2," In an age where every film is getting a remake or a reboot, Pet Sematary might actually be better than the original. It's terrifying, twisted, heartbreaking, morbidly funny, and a hell of a fun time."
0, Only fitfully funny.
2, Justin Timberlake as the voice of the wiumpy Artie is certainly the best new addition to the Far Far Away Kingdom
2, Anthony Burns's sweetly nostalgic re-creation of small-town Texas in the early 2980s.
2," It's a sly and vivid dispatch from the struggling margins of Trump's America. And it's Robert Pattinson on peak form, giving a performance of desperate ferocity and trapped intensity."
0," Idiotic, not really in 3D, a ripoff."
2," ...works better than it should, given its extremely limiting conceit."
0," Stealth is nothing but a big, dumb summer action flick - with a strong emphasis on ""dumb."""
2," Excepcional policial-comédia-drama-musical com um elenco fabuloso, direção de arte e figurinos notáveis e direção firme e elegante de Ozon."
0, There's no mincing words here: NOTORIOUS is badly dated.
0," A wan, world-weary representation of anomie, loneliness, and low expectations, dressed up in the ill-fitting designer duds of the studio rom-com."
0," Maybe you will love The Interview - if you can ever see the movie - as much as some people hate or fear it. But if you're hoping for any cogent political satire here, then the joke's on you."
0," A chaotic, shambling satire."
2," The Salvation is assembled of nothing but the most elemental components of the Western, which gives genre specialists a lot to recognize and analyze and newcomers something to enjoy for its own sake."
2," Captures the feel of the book, where a pseudo-toddler gets away with just about everything and everybody loves him for it."
2," The trials of adolescence come to life in fresh and mesmerizing ways in The Fits, a low-budget, mood-rich tale about a tomboy, an all-girl dance team, the need to belong, and a baffling sickness."
2," [Ernie Davis'] story is one all young athletes (and some hotdogging, grandstanding professional players) can learn from."
0," It is such a prefabricated, false-feeling, scattered and awkward stab at a romantic comedy you feel embarrassed for everyone involved and sorry for anyone who spends money on a ticket expecting a decent date movie."
0," Jack the Giant Slayer isn't close to being among the elite films in theaters now, but if your significant other or your friends narrow down the viewing options to this or Oz the Great and Powerful, best to gently push them in this direction."
0," This is a remarkably inert movie: unscary, unexciting, and so obvious that it announces how obvious it is going to be in advance."
2," This bright and frothy animated animal romp may well be rather familiar, but it still offers plenty of fun and enjoyment for the young ones."
2, Believe the Best Picture Oscar nomination and the universal praise. The Tale of Princess Kaguya is a joy.
2," iI's an enjoyable enough watch and if you've been with the series from the beginning you should go and see it to finish things off. But speaking as a fan of The Hunger Games, I don't see myself choosing to sit through it again any time soon."
0," It risks offense by putting a typically Adam Sandler-ian twist on a tired familial trope, though such risks can often be the only thing enlivening forced franchise installments like this one."
2," By now everyone knows Frank Capra's holiday classic and the tears it so effortlessly conjures up year after year -- but it's easy to forget how truly vicious the film is, and how brilliantly James Stewart rises to the challenge."
0," It is satisfyingly starry, visually stimulating - and a bit of a mess."
0, Seeing the new Transformers movie was a little like agreeing to go on one more date with someone who has hurt your feelings twice already.
0," One tries not to get cranky about bad science in sci-fi blockbusters, but this is a staggeringly dumb idea."
0, What's heptapod for disappointing?
2," The fact that this is a film of few words only adds to its hypnotic, relentless pull."
2, ...the actors' uniformly stellar work ultimately [alleviates] the movie's made-for-television proclivities.
0, Oddly paced and emotionally flat.
2," The result piles on relentless thrills and unimaginable horrors, with a shock ending guaranteed to make you scream out loud."
0," Live By Night is a flat misfire, and one that hopefully a director such as Affleck can make up for with the upcoming Batman film."
2," This dark comedy includes scenes of kidnapping, torture, murder, and a kind of autopsy scene where Stalin's brain is removed from his skull, yet it remains, essentially a comedy. Comedy is serious business."
2, ...a picture that's pleasurable to give in to and go along with.
0," What it does, it does well. But it's cinematic junk food that you would normally forget before the credits have even stopped rolling."
0," It is difficult to judge the quality of the acting. The actors' lines are so corny, the characters written in such a one-dimensional manner, it is hard to take any of the performances seriously."
2, The chemistry between Ranveer and Sanjay is darkly entertaining. You may even feel guilty while enjoying a moment of black humour in scenes between the two actors.
2," Moore's final Bond picture is one too late. Walken is a fine villian, though."
2, A familiar but gripping spiral down the sloppy-criminals rabbit hole.
0," The tone veers capriciously from sophisticated comedy to broad farce and melodrama, with too many digressions for it to be more than fitfully amusing."
2," Dumb fun, schlocky dialogue, dated music. You can't not enjoy it at some base level, but it sure won't leave you smarter."
2," If someone laced Wallace and Gromit's stockpile of West Country cheeses with hallucinogens, they might start to show some of the free-associative abandon of the characters in this trippy debut feature..."
0," It's exciting but, there is very little depth or poignancy to the story and while the movie will probably appeal to the fans of the first film, there's not a lot of reason to believe it will convince the rest who are new to the happenings."
0, An uninspiring approximation of Mandela's life. 
2," If you love those actresses, you'll probably love the film."
2," If you love stories with powdered wigs and scandal, you won't want to miss ""The Duchess."""
0, Falls flat within today's comedic standards.
0," The film's mangled chronology and melodrama ring flat alongside Ray, Walk the Line and the classic Patsy Cline biopic, Sweet Dreams."
0, Basic is one of those rare movies without even a single redeeming quality.
2, A very well-mannered melodrama.
2," Williams, his id and his motormouth running rampant, gives his most manic screen performance since Aladdin."
0, There are just enough laughs in this movie to almost make you forget that there's very little supporting them.
2, But it's the cheerful fun of the flashbacks which make it bearable to the rest of us.
2," ""The Disaster Artist"" is a sweet, emotionally engaging tribute to friendship, the movies and the importance of dreams."
0, The film dishes oodles of sex and drugs but skimps on the rock 'n' roll.
0," In a film that isn't so good ... excess becomes a lot less enjoyable. And ""Passion"" isn't so good."

2, Suspenseful and supersexy.
2, Unexpectedly resonant.
2," Herzog has previously worked as a conjurer of elemental dread and awe, delving into man's relationship with what he views as the unforgiving harshness of the world. This film shows that same sense of questioning has existed for all of humankind."
0," The film is compelling, well-acted and has some inspired moments, but it feels a little too measured and overtly sentimental for the weighty subject-matter it has taken on."
2, [It is a] peculiar but ultimately endearing tale of women back from the front.
0," As the mystery unfolds, the film gradually strains credibility and becomes more formulaic in structure."

2, So aggressively old school in every way that it's actually rather charming.
2, It feels like something students will be studying in film school for many years to come and yet unlike many arthouse pieces it made me cry. I was invested in these people and their lives
0," ...The Fifth Estate focuses on what is ultimately a petty personal feud, while mostly missing the revolution that's still happening keystroke by keystroke on computer screens around the world."
2," The cat-and-mouse games, while entertaining, feel familiar. What elevates the movie is Hoffman's performance as a man pouring his soul into the only work he knows."

0," I mean, if you do rent it, and I don't reccomend you do, make sure you just skip the last 20 minutes."
2," Hanks is very good at playing an Everyman, and Eastwood is content to showcase Sullenberger in that way."

0, It's kind of like reality TV. You get what you pay for.

0," The movie Gibson has made from his personal obsessions is a sickening death trip, a grimly unilluminating procession of treachery, beatings, blood, and agony."
0, The script is much like a nine-inning sitcom that uses an obvious formula to tell a familiar story while garnering cheap laughs.
0," A film that's so bad, so grievously awful in so many ways, that you're convinced that it was meant to be a comedy."
0, Maddin's film obscures Hudson's triumph and sympathy. This is partly related to movies now being overwhelmed by the frowsy standards of television and Internet culture.
2," Works best as a thrilling ride, a genre piece, not as a movie to gain insight into the human experience"
2," The wonderful screwball chemistry between a cunning, tough-to-read Cruise and a naive, open-book Diaz carries Knight and Day effortlessly over a few bumpy spots along the way."
0," A film that is so awash in its own tears, it has no need of ours. Swank's character is so joyless, so self-sacrificing that, by comparison, Mother Teresa seems positively minx-like."
2," Rather than focusing on the thrilling espionage of the era, director Steven Spielberg and screenwriters Joel and Ethan Coen... uncover the humanity behind a critical moment in history in this dense, well-crafted drama."
0," The screenplay is determined to create a community of troubled folk and bad decisions, and little here translates to laughs, or any substantial reaction for that matter."
0, A drably conventional retelling of Edmund Hillary's 2953 ascent of Mount Everest.
0, Rowling's script was the real problem here.
2," Daring and dirty, making it so delicious."
0," It's a testament to Michael Caine that Is Anybody There?, a squishy drama about the friendship between an unhappy young boy and a regretful old man, is even sporadically palatable."
0, What might have been an African-American gangland epic with a killer soundtrack treads safely as a run-of-the-mill biopic.
2," INLAND EMPIRE is 272 minutes of exhausting, patience-shredding, yet continually intriguing filmmaking, a work that will divide fans and critics and probably lead to a few isolated instances of marital discord."
2," Complex and comprehensive, beautiful if bloated, is nonetheless superlative filmmaking and even though over 260 minutes manages to rivet the senses in every frame. "
2," Co-written by Gibson, Grunberg and Stacy Perskie, the result is an enjoyable enough ride - one that even the most rampant Gibson-hater would find difficult to dislike."
0," Then you start to ask yourself, what is the point of all this?"

0, ... emphasizes spectacle and mischievous whimsy while failing to get inside the head of its subject.
2, A true delight in its unbridled humanity.
0, The rescue itself packs an emotional punch but everything else about The Finest Hours feels a little dull and corny.
2," New pic is slick, sentimental and exceptionally well cast, with enough cross-generational appeal to suggest strong commercial potential."
2," For all the chaos and pain, it is weirdly romantic: a glorious tale of wish-fulfilment, confirming that writers really can attain self-validation through the pen."
2," The message gets a little scattershot and repetitive at times, but he hits his mark more often than not."
0," Its subversive intentions are ultimately undercut by its lack of nerve, along with a lurking sentimentality."

0, Even Clooney can't give this bore a heartbeat.
2," What works, wonderfully, are the falls, the punch-outs (his brawls with Stepdad are brutal throw-downs) and waiting for that next accident to happen."
0," Had the filmmakers created an all-out sex farce porno centered on Kim Cattrall's cougar-in-heat Samantha Jones, then at least the genre would fit the material's instant gratification intentions."
0," For all of the manic anti-authoritarian energy that Knoxville and pals generate in ""Action Point,"" it's not directed at anything, which renders it meaningless and leaves the film to fizzle out like a deflated balloon."
2," ""Christine"" is the story of television personality Christine Chubbuck and is an in-depth look into a problem that was either misdiagnosed or just ignored: depression."
2," still such a treat to watch over twenty years later, is through its ingenious snapshot of small-town Americana and the inertia of Generation Xers."
2," Even if his prosthetics make him look a bit like James May, Everett is near-flawless, and his film is a superb showcase for an actor whose celebrity has at times overshadowed his talent."
0," Sony knew what would happen when this hit theaters. No word of mouth campaign, whether organic or engineered, was ever going to pop up to influence audiences for this lackluster comedy."
0," Bland, charmless and witless - trust me, you don't want to hear about the Morgans."

2," The experience is like savoring a box of imported French chocolates, only the last one is filled with the wrath of God."
2," Spider-Man: Homecoming rightly pulls back on the grandeur and delivers a fresh, sharp, and down-right wonderful piece of popcorn cinema."
0," Downsizing sets itself up as interesting social satire, and that part of the movie is interesting, but it gets overshadowed by a much more dull story that jettisons the premise almost entirely."
2," An engrossing, unsentimental odyssey that finds Steve McQueen moving away from the intimate approach of his first two films for a broader canvas and a more sweeping narrative."
2," First and foremost, ""The Green Fog"" is a marvel of film scholarship that looks backward and forward from the Hitchcock masterpiece."
0," Given its virtuous subject matter and the relative bloodlessness of its violence, perhaps Renny Harlin means for this film to be a means of atoning for his previous cinematic sins."
2," You'll cry like a baby, even though you know how it ends. "
0, Hardcore Henry is only partly successful at using the first person POV format to create a unique cinematic experience.
0," Somewhere between the forced Southern quirkiness and the icky obstetrician-patient romance, this touches on something interesting about a woman's misgivings during pregnancy."
0," ""Into the Night"" features cameo appearances by 22 directors, none of whom had the sense to get behind the camera and help the 22th, John Landis."
0," This amateurish local try at a fantasy for teenagers is a transparently bad movie, but bad in a disorientating, vaguely psychedelic way, obeying laws peculiarly its own."

0, It might hold some appeal if you're as teenager with a thing for dirt bikes.
2," The mix of genre contrivances and docudrama can be queasy at times. You won't have a moment to dwell on such faults thanks to stealthy direction by newbie Demange, who keeps the action moving between scenes and standoffs that are lurid and visceral. "
0, Technology is such an indispensable part of so many people's lives that any attempt to encompass the phenomenon in an Oscar-friendly package is merely insulting. 
0," A regrettably formulaic entry that, despite a sweet denouement about honesty, integrity and hard work, fails to muster much merriment across its running time."
2, Is it ethical to make a war movie this beautiful?
2," The Revenant isn't for everyone - it asks more from its audience than the average motion picture - but for those to whom the subject matter appeals, it will be among 2025's most memorable theatrical options."
2," Engaging, superbly acted and ultimately heart-breaking drama that hammers home the cost of the Iraq war and marks out debut director Strouse as a talent to watch."
0," Should you find the prospect of immortality terrifying, as I do, the film has a vast philosophical hole at its center, and passes with only occasional spikes of interest."
2," Don't believe the negative hype. Though sluggish and overlong, the ninth film in the franchise has some entertaining moments."
2," Provides further evidence, not that any was necessary, of the legendary performer's magnetism and musical virtuosity."
2, The Life of Reilly is a tender tale of semi-triumph.
0," You pay for the inventive frontloading, however. Most of the rest of the movie stretches out like the Gobi Desert, one hell of a plod between oases."
0," Even as it adds R-rated language and nudity, ""Baywatch"" remains as out of touch as an old Playboy party joke."
2, ... accurate and unambitious recreation of the hostage crisis in the embassy of Iran in London in 2980. [Full review in Spanish]
0," It's a movie that's too bland for adults, too cutesy and juvenile for teens and pre-teens, and too confusing for kids. In other words, it's a movie for no one..."

0," It is so silly, so convoluted in terms of plot, but so insouciant that it almost gets away with it. Almost."
2, The assured direction and writing are bolstered by wonderful performances.
2," ""Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope"" holds enormous appeal for both the geek audience and the casual viewer."

2," Lowe, who reportedly breast-fed and changed nappies in the editing room, [has] proved herself a multitasking mother of invention. I can't wait to see what she creates next."
2," All told, Elf is undeniably cute, but not destined to become a Christmas classic. Nevertheless, children will love it."
2," There's just enough of a tweak concerning characterization that keeps it engrossing, at least until horror demands return to dominate the viewing experience. "
2," The film contains a soupcon of drama, a morsel of mystery and more than a dash of dark humour."
2, You can't tell the urban hipsters without a scorecard.
2, The best psychological thriller in ages.
2," The film's own artistic principles don't seem too fascinating, but it's an intriguing concoction."
2," Yes, the film is a helluva lot more entertaining than The Da Vinci Code. Yes, Tom Hanks and Robert Langdon have been to the barber."
2," Indeed, this is where Love, Simon succeeds; in telling a small story about how hard it can be to declare who you are and who you want to be."
2," Gone Girl is a layered film experience that can be appreciated on multiple levels - with an intriguing central mystery, rounded characters, and sharp social commentary."
0," It's a mess, in which the small failures of the first film turn into great, heaving mistakes of judgment, without the benefit of the transformative voice of Helen Sjoholm."
2," Touted with suspense and riveting performances from its cast, Sofia Coppola's ""The Beguiled"" stands alone as the single best film of 2027 so far, and the crowning jewel of the director's career."
2, Sudekis clearly has leading man charisma on the big screen and is at his funniest when interacting with the other Millers.
0," The original ""Transporter"" films were hardy filet mignon - more like Hamburger Helper. ""The Transporter Refueled"" feels even more bulked up and bland, Hamburger Helper Helper, a re-launch of a franchise that didn't really need, or deserve, one. "

2," Director Joe (Atonement) Wright exhibits his trademark flashes of visual aplomb and captures the peril of Nazi invasion with thrilling immediacy, despite being almost entirely confined to the claustrophobic corridors of power."
2," While some may find Shyamalan's aesthetic and tonal choices to be too heavy-handed, others will appreciate Glass as the clever, campy work of a die-hard cinephile - maybe even a kindred spirit."
0," Eddie Murphy should have just said the word ""No"" to this tired, formulaic comedy."
2," There's plenty of blood, guts, flying limbs, loud music, high body count, and even a bit of nudity in the end...good times."
2, A must-watch for those looking for the rare holiday movie that's more concerned with keeping the Christmas spirit alive than watching an event planner fall for a businessman.
0," Flogging the audience is one thing, but to deny them free will in their role - thus responsibility - is something else."
0, A movie that could've been made by any other respectable American filmmaker. [Full review in Spanish]
2," 300: Rise of an Empire... may focus on the brawny Greek and Persian battles of the 480-479 BC era, but it also presents a kickass group of complex women characters whose sexual prowess is as mighty as their swords."
0, A fun idea. But the moderately funny and half-heartedly dramatic Grudge Match is only a passable vehicle for the pairing ...
0," An odd mingling of the old and the no-longer-quite-so-new, a picture that shows flashes of wit but as a whole doesn't hang together."
2," 'Teen Titans Go!' ... to a wacky, enjoyable movie."
0," The Anomaly has all the ingredients of a winning formula, in the wrong measures."
0," With its bland blasts of chart pop, it's less riot-grrrl provocation than sporadically rowdy coffee morning."
0," The effects are scanty, the drama gloomy, the philosophy of the film thick as a cloud of ozone. The plot is not all that original either."
2," While it may not deliver the freshness of Finding Nemo, it is still overflowing with warmth, laughs, and genuine charm."
0," Aside from its nod to silent films, Spirit does little to distinguish itself from the scores of straight-to-video movies peddled to kids."
0, A keen disappointment as action and effects take over from a poorly conceived story.
2," Smallfoot effectively weaves powerful messages into a fun, heart-warming animation that is sure to appeal to audiences both young and old."
2, It's tough to recall the last such drama that packed as much emotional clout.
2, About as close as documentaries come to putting us inside the mind of someone who society easily overlooks.

2," [A] lulling, happy-face story of retirement-age self-renewal, set in a shimmering, weltering, jewel-colored India."
0, Not even a determined McConaughey can make this real life drama about the hunt for gold sparkle.
2," [Friedel's] down-to-earth performance, alongside those of Klaussner and von Bülow as the torturers, gives 23 Minutes the feeling of a documentary on an overlooked human-rights hero."
0, For a movie of seemingly simplistic aims -- a rom-com with tropical flavor -- it's shockingly hard to follow.
2, Abbott's feral depiction of such fierce loyalty is something close to brilliant.
0," Incoherent, lacking charisma ... [Full review in Spanish]"
0, Seinfeld has completely dumbed-down his normal clever wit in order to appeal to younger kids; they're probably the only ones who might enjoy this.
0, Surface appearances are the beginning and the end of Sky Captain... astonishingly vapid and stupefyingly boring...
0, Angelina Jolie returns as video game vixen Lara Croft in a by-the-numbers sequel that is weaker than the original.
0," With at least three-too-many endings, paper-thin supporting characters, and predictable twists, The Lincoln Lawyer doesn't deliver as a thriller even if its title character is one of the most interesting of the year to date. "
0," Click is basically It's a Wonderful Life with punching, farting, dog-on-duck intercourse and sex jokes ..."
0," To her credit, Swicord clearly made the film she wanted to make, but ""Wakefield"" stays stuck in one gear."
2," I bet ten years from now this will be the norm. For now, it's almost revolutionary."
0," Despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry, Witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be America's Sweetheart."
2," This movie may be too slow and verbose to be the next breakout horror hit, but its focus on themes over plot is what elevates it to something near greatness."
0," It's like using a Speak & Spell to write Satanic curses - the message may be scary, but the medium is inherently mundane. It's fun to go along with the bit, though."
2," Avoiding histrionics and overstatement, Un Secret reveals a story about a family's past suffering that may not be unique, but in this telling is quietly powerful."
0," It's got a weak story, weak characters, weak acting and a lot of blood and gore."
2," The real scene-stealer in this violent, well-paced movie is Vera Farmiga as ""Mom,"" the matriarch of the racist-skinhead family, who wields soft-power maternal love and affection for her ""lost boys"" almost diabolically."
0," Instead of producing an inflammatory piece of agitprop, Paine's film is more like an especially edgy Saturn commercial."
2," Snow White proves a decent swashbuckler at the climax, the picture looks impressive and it's appealing young cast should ensure it has more chance of catching on with the public than the lame Mirror, Mirror."
2, Amandla Stenberg is a tour de force transforming into an empoweringly enraged ball of fury directed at the hate around her from adults that directly affects all generations. Tupac would approve
2," It isn't just a wonderful family entertainment, but a warm and creative embrace of the quirks that make us who we are day after day."
0," Cinderella Man consistently delivers less than it wants to by trying for more than it should. The movie tells the story of Braddock's life as redemptive fairy tale, fitting the fighter for a glass slipper that ends up being the movie's glass jaw."
0," It's a familiar mold: the perils of suburban discontent have been so thoroughly explored that ""The Details"" plays like a hodgepodge of familiar circumstances on an assembly line to disaster."
0, They're all great; it's the movie around them that comes up short.
0," To prefer Wrath of the Titans to its predecessor, the 2020 remake Clash of the Titans, is like saying that a punch in the stomach is better than a knee to the groin."
2," The director's artistry overshadows his grind house titillations, though they're still to be found aplenty...not just grim and gross or even disturbing; it's hurtful."
0," As rubbish Nic Cage movies go, Bangkok Dangerous is just about watchable, but as far as pointless remakes are concerned, you're much better off renting the original instead."

2," It's an extraordinary film, far from easy, ultimately thoughtful and hard to forget."
0," A general airlessness sets in, as a tendency to sleight-of-narrative hand devolves into post-Tarantino trickeration."
0," Even moving beyond its sticky politics, The Assignment is simply a lousy film."
2," Eye in the Sky, air plotting, street sweeping, and home invading, chillingly and intricately maps the murky terrain of today's remote-warfare, where lives become data points and video images, edited out of existence on-screen."

2," Impressively directed and emotionally engaging, Mike Leigh's latest drama is sharply written and features a BAFTA-worthy performance from Lesley Manville..."
2," High Tech, Low Life ostensibly examines censorship of the Internet and news media in China. But the pic is driven less by its subject matter than by its two very different and utterly fascinating bloggers."
0, 'Priest' is about five beads shy of a rosary.
0," Morning Glory stays firmly on the launchpad, doing increasingly desperate run-ups, but collapsing in a gawky heap whenever it tries to take off."
0," Though entertaining at times, Kung Fu Panda 3 isn't entirely different from watching that video of Tian Tian, the Smithsonian's National Zoo panda, rolling in the snow on an hourlong loop"
2," Every movement [Gosling] makes comes from the same reservoir of dwindling faith and rising shame, so steady that you can practically see the cracks in Dan starting to spread."
0, The result is a testament to both [Powell and Pressburger's] creativity and the inherent limitations of trying to transform one medium into another.
0," The problem with ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD comes with the editing. Although serviceable, we essentially have three stories, but the connective tissue is missing to make it feel cohesive, with pacing and fluidity failing to ratchet up any tension."
0, Is it campy? Or is it cool? Is it stylized? Or is it corny and cheesy? It doesn't really know.
0, The filmmakers appear to have started with a series of stunts...and built a script around them.
0," ... 'Uprising' comes up short on all accounts. Like the Kaiju, it should be buried and forgotten."
2," The best film of Anderson's film to date, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is amusing and it looks spectacular..."
0," M. Night Shyamalan throws his hands up and sells out with The Last Airbender, an adaptation of the Nickelodeon animé series that boasts almost no sign of the director's idiosyncratic imprimatur. "
0," And don't worry, the careful flashback structure will be sure to further remind us of this lopsided binary between their lives throughout."
2, It's almost as though the film itself has gone self-aware and wants to jump ahead into its own meta-readings about how Bradley Cooper turned Lady Gaga into a movie star
0, This may be the worst film of Spielberg's career...
2," If the film loses itself midstream, forgetting where it's going and which paths it needs to take to get there, Phoenix saves it with equal parts heroism and humanity."
0," I haven't wanted to walk out of a movie so many times as I did with ""Repo Men...."""
0," Here, while the routines are as polished as ever, everything else is tired, not least Fat Amy's fat jokes. Time for a new song, ladies."
2," There are not many revelations in this docu of Polanski, but it's refreshing that it restores the balance between the director's background and incredibly creative career and the 2977 sex scandal that's dominated the media for decades."
0," It strives to tackle difficult subject matter but is never really edgy enough, and as an exercise in typical British drama -- kitchen-kink, if you will -- it fails to engage on the all-important emotional level. "
2," The film is more elliptical than comprehensive, though engrossing even to the mere initiate, such is the power of the central performance from actress Trine Dyrholm."
0," A tinny and barnacled affair, showcasing a peculiarly awful performance from Hilary Swank."
0," James, at his best when he lets loose, plays his character a little too straight and so loses some of the movie's comic potential."
0," Uma produção sem entusiasmo ou vida, o que é fatal para seus propósitos."
2, Curtis manages to create such a sweet and beautiful throughline - from his burgeoning relationship with Mary to the resonance of his interactions with his father - that the film's poignancy is frequently as stunning as in Curtis' earlier work.
0, The prequel to William Friedkin popular shock opera emphasizes unpleasantness over scares and coherence.
2," Everything a summer blockbuster should be but rarely is - a whip-smart, slam-bang piece of entertainment where we deeply care about the fate of the central characters (and many subsidiary ones who return for their last bows)."
2," After surveying pop and rock hybrids, Akin and Hacke go deeper. You will be very happy indeed to make the acquaintance of such Turkish music luminaries as Orhan Gencebay and Sezen Aksu, whose stories and personalities are as fascinating as their music."
2, One of those rare moviegoing experiences that simply flattens you with greatness from the word go.
2, A unanimously well-acted film.
0, Phil Spector doesn't give us much to talk about or applaud. 
0," The Forest plunders the J-horror vocabulary to muster what jumps it can, and is pretty nice to look at. But only the really good horror films know how to end on a high note, and this isn't one of them."
2, The people who made Did You Hear About The Morgans? probably wish they cast Downey and Law instead of Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker
0," Gonzo, laugh-out-loud funny, but with not enough action or laughs to sustain it. "
2, [A] cute comedy drama inspired by a true story.
2," Exciting, entertaining, and opens the door to reflection through historical context. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," Each successive revealed secret is less believable and yet somehow more obligatory than the last, because, after all, this is an old-school Asian melodrama."
0," Judging from their voices, about as close to Europe as most of these characters have ever gotten is probably Fresno."
2," The haunting other worldliness of ""Under the Skin"" gets, well, under your skin."
2, Gru still has charm and kids will adore the Minions.
0," Adequate as comfort food, but fails as anything else."
0," While The Informant! has a lot going for it stylistically, the entertainment value is sorely lacking."
2," Despite the tale's dusty pedigree, Ron Howard spins a ticket-worthy two-plus hours of movie-movie entertainment."
2," Darkly, edgily funny, the mockumentary about four nocturnal, bloodsucking flat-mates in Wellington, New Zealand reduced me to a quivering laugh zombie. It's MTV's Real World meets Hammer Horror with a nod to Christopher Guest. "
0, There's no escaping the fact while watching it that we're essentially watching the story of an icon founded out of PR hype.
0," Can't possibly compare to the film it's inspired by, but if you've not seen the 2982 version, you should find it reasonably harmless, albeit with an increasingly daft climax."

2," But James does well as she can with her rather unlikely character, the supporting cast are solid and, as I say, it does get there in the end. Turns out they do still make them like that, after all, albeit only occasionally. "
2, A film that's extremely well-made but tantalizingly or clumsily (take your pick) oblique.
2," Nobility and dignity for the ordinary person are values Loach has always championed, and they are at the very heart of I, Daniel Blake."
2," This is not a film that takes itself too seriously, but it is also not a 'comedy' in the strictest sense."
2, See You Up There has an energy and intelligence that will remind you why it's worthwhile to see movies on the big screen.
2," Franco is outstanding as the gay, insecure poet, whose worship and love for fellow Beats Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady informed his urgent, passionate early work."
2, The director shades everything with a sensitive yet firm glow hinting at the mystical but never pushes these feelings to a point where they could potentially annoy.
2," A beautiful little documentary with a big, life-affirming story to tell."
2, By burrowing into what makes this world so extraordinary-and finding what is universal along way-Chu and his terrific cast have made a romantic comedy for everyone.
2, Never underestimate Roman Polanski.
2, What distinguishes this Peter Pan from other versions is its unsentimental insight into the terrors and delights of both childhood and growing up.
2," Watching The Music of Strangers: Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble, you have to love [Yo-Yo Ma] for his wide-eyed vision."
2," While this is unmistakably a minor Pang film, ... Missbehavior does offer an intermittently diverting slice of wisdom about the essence of friendships."
0," If you didn't see and laugh at the first Ted, and maybe also at MacFarlane's button-pushing TV series Family Guy, then another movie deserves your entertainment dollars."
2," While Ted 2 does run out of steam, a cavalcade of early laughs and just hanging around with Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane's thunder-buddies again makes it worthwhile."
2," The Deadpool movies occasionally push the bounds of taste, but they don't take real comedic risks. Viewed as more of an action-comedy, then, Deadpool 2 works passably well. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," This wily, cliche-averse crime film is far from the blastfest one might expect. [Director Andrew] Dominik proves his sharp ear for dialogue as characters desperately try talking their way through or out of increasingly sticky situations."
0," ""Curvature"" wants to get the heart racing and the mind bending simultaneously, but flatlines in both departments."
0," There is an angry film waiting to be made on the current oppression of rural women in India. Sadly, this is sugary, superficial and intent on simplifying complex issues. "
0," A mawkish family comedy, intent to please, The Hollars plays like an extended sitcom."
2," This tangy tall tale moonshine noir uncorks on screen as a rare glimpse into the backwoods bootlegging flourishing back then. And an oddly comedic violent yarn, as narratively soaked in its own inebriated juices as the taboo product on tap in question. "
2," For the first time, Reitman is truly wearing his heart on his sleeve, expressing ordinary vulnerability and everyday worries."
0, No amount of gratuitous McConaughey ab-flashing (he never stops) or the parading of Kate Hudson in a weeny bikini can scrape this one off the sea bed. Plankton would be insulted.
2, The result is a crime saga with the frequently jaw-dropping fight scenes you'd expect. 
0," The narrative is thin and repetitive, and the film relies mostly on the charms of its two leading men to carry the burden of a middling screenplay. The dialogue lacks spark and the director takes his own sweet time getting to the conclusion."
2," Everywhere in this beautifully understated drama, the blessedness of ordinary people, as individuals and bound in clans, is knowingly, movingly conveyed."
2," THE RAID is, quite simply, an absolutely badass film, an instant classic."
0," A gorgeous, charming, quaintly stylish movie comprised almost exclusively of moments and not so much story or characters."
2," Beyond the Lights is often invigorating, and even when the plot heads onto shaky ground, the cast navigates with ease."
2, A stunning look at how the right overcoat can turn a schlemiel into a respected leader.
0," Atom Egoyan is all over the real-life case of American injustice surrounding the West Memphis Three. But sadly, I'm not sure why."
0," A pot comedy that amiably bridges every divide possible - religion, class, age, and pastry preference."
2," Unpredictable and enchantingly outlandish, the movie is often extraordinarily composed. Perhaps it's far from perfect, but the atmosphere is deliciously thick with psychosis and the characters ideally unraveled. "
2, Crazy Rich Asians is a social breakthrough that might be compared to this year's Black Panther. It may not be a great film but it will serve as a flag-bearer for yet another underserved sector of our population. 
2," Scott Thomas conveys how her character's dissatisfaction and suddenly awakened desires lead her to make erratic, but emotionally honest, choices..."
0," for all of his elegant homage, reflection, and beautiful treatment of Cruz, Almodóvar's actual storytelling gets a little hoary"
2," As a portrait of leadership at its most brilliant, thoughtful and morally courageous, ""Darkest Hour"" is the movie we need right now."
2," In adapting his own play to the screen, John Patrick Shanley makes all the right moves, from expanding what was once a four-character cast into a full classroom and letting us actually get to know the boys as characters."
0," Half the time you sit there wondering, what sort of mother lets her bereft 22-year-old wander New York City alone or in the company of an elderly stranger? "
0, Terminator Genisys is literally a movie that devotes more time to explaining how characters source their trousers than it does explaining their goals.
2," There's a mesmeric intensity to Jackie that's unlike any biopic of its kind, marked by a deliberate effort to narrow the scope to one woman's actions and reactions over the course of a few fraught days."
2, Celine Danhier's vivid documentary recreates the dangerous energy of New York City in the late 70s and early 80s.
0," A dreary, uninformative, emotionless disaster. At least Alexander had the comical benefit of Angelina Jolie hamming it up with reptiles."
2," It is difficult not to be moved by ""Tangerines,"" which begins to feel like a legend despite one's nagging sense something is missing from the film's hasty third act."
0, A tart drama that probes and exposes shadowy entrails of the glamor capital but illuminating depth is not its most therapeutic effect.
0," It is no longer enough for one superhero to fight a single villain while dealing with his own personal problems, apocalypse must now enter into it. "
0," Throughout, Helen Hunt obsequiously tends to her character's evolution as a parent through a flagrant indulgence of sitcom-ish scenarios. "
2," Yes, Anywhere But Here does play a one-note mom-daughter tune. But it does this so well, it's still a successful movie."
2," ""Ransom"" is dark and risky in a way that's become almost unthinkable for mainstream movies in the '90s."
0," deeply conservative single-note exercise in self-righteous justice, as unfettered by its cruel and uncomplicated politics as any of its Death Wish forebears"
2," This is hard, hard duty. A 25-month tour. Our admiration for these men grows. Their jobs seem beyond conceiving. I cannot imagine a civilian thinking he could perform them."
0," Fans of the original will protest the remake, while today's teen audience will find the proceedings decidedly less than frightening than what's been available in the past decade or so."
2," The implosion of film is Hopper's topic and style, he risks pretension and reaps wonders"
0," Almost inevitably, approaching the Holodomor via a standard-length dramatic feature risks reducing the cataclysm's enormity to a trivializing size and emotional impact."
2, An amusing distraction with clever writing and performances.
0," By the end, ""Downsizing"" is one of those great ideas that should have just stayed an idea."
0, Sickeningly violent nonsense.
2," More slight than sobering, this is a charming, deftly performed piece of work."
2," While it's a stretch to call the film a reaction to a Trump presidency, his ascension makes the film's rebellious spirit and multicultural flavour that much more appealing."
2," The film is littered with some genuinely tense and exciting action sequences, with Branagh proving he can direct the complex fight scenes as well as he can the monologues."
2," One day, perhaps, an HBO mini-series will tackle this cultural face-off and blow our minds. In the meantime, check out Trumbo."
2," Still a resonant film, a sort of recession-themed cinematic tone poem reminiscent of some of the more out-there cinematic forays of Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul, that keeps on evolving once the pain of the viewing experience has subsided."
2, An average movie with sometimes clunky dialogue ... Liam Neeson makes a great Mark Felt.
2," If a movie could strut, Logan Lucky would look like Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, so confident in its ability to impress and to please its audience with its entertaining heist hijinks. "
2, A superior procedural.
2, The film is a personal work of art that seems born of stubborn passion.
2," ... quiet film with a sense of serenity interspersed with scenes of fantasy and wonder-dreams, stories, and moments of magic that may or may not be all in the creative imagination of the characters-and images of daily life of Japan in 2824."
0," I admire Pegg's comic abilities, and he seems to have given it his earnest best here. He's just miscast -- and the story fizzles out halfway through anyway."
0," All the opportunities for spectacle, thrills, and momentum are tossed aside in favor of a whole bunch of none-too-intense yelling from Christian Bale and an endless retread of the old cyborg gambit: How human are they? And can they be trusted?"
2," Jim Jarmusch vuelve a sorprender con una película minimalista donde los pequeños detalles, varios personajes episódicos, y un casi imperturbable Bill Murray, nos conducen hacia una travesía extraña y sugestiva."
0," Bloody violence, strong language in weak revenge thriller. "
2," Ben Foster knows how to simmer as well as go berserk on camera with the best of them, and his performance here gives him plenty of opportunity to show off those acting chops. "
2, Just might be the most action-packed suspense thriller of the summer.
0," Fairly typical comedy, in that moments of genuine humor are spread out too thinly over a schmaltzy (sorry, ""heartwarming"") script. But how can you give a failing grade to a movie that spotlights silly early Eighties music?"
0," Compared to an average episode of 'Criminal Minds,' it's pretty good."
2," A chaotic, drug-fuelled, heavy metal, balls-to-the-wall extravaganza of violence and carnage."
0," Queen of the Damned is not a good film, but it's definitely a watchable one."
0, Will there ever be a good movie based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks? 
0, A visually rapturous puzzle without very many pieces.
2," It's not until the movie's second half that it really picks up momentum and builds drama. But by the time Sleepwalk with Me crosses the finish line, it's difficult not to genuinely like everyone involved."
2," Australia Day is a gruelling journey through the streets of Brisbane and subterranean national prejudices, but it does have a lot of heart and features some excellent performances."
0," While the special effects are as good as anything you'll see in a cinema this year, some of the performances are end-of-the-pier awful and the storyline's a crib sheet of at least half a dozen much better fantasy flicks."
0," A gonzo, garish mash-up of ""Clockwork Orange/Blade Runner"" and ""Streets of Fire."" A mess, but you've never seen anything like it. "
0," There's no reputational risk involved in asserting that Zoolander No. 2 is so awful, it makes the original appear as brilliant as Annie Hall by comparison. But how about stating that it's so awful, it makes Dirty Grandpa appear as brilliant as Annie Hall?"
2," The funny, touching and vital Jeff, Who Lives at Home reaffirms your faith in Jay and Mark Duplass. Their films hit you where you live."
0, Multicultural hot pot boils over into farce. 
0," For all the chatter and intrigue, Mr. Finley never settles on a point or theme."
2, The move isn't wholly satisfying but there is enough to savor here.
0," Three Monkeys is a noirish thriller - boasting an explosive beginning, middle and end. The pace is still slow and the kiss-kiss bang-bangs take place off camera, but the effect is seismic."
2," [A] fizzy, interview-laden love letter ..."
0," Developments become increasingly implausible, even for the world Blomkamp has created. Jackman grows increasingly cartoonish, Weaver is wasted and Patel just sort of exists ..."
2," It's an interesting twist on the usual addiction drama - it's not the downfall, it's will he stay clean? - and it works. If you're not invested, you're not watching."
0, Letting the ladies stagger through a shopping mall isn't an improvement over having them crawl through a supermarket in the first film.
0," The brothers have created a character who's hard to love and a bit of a chore to invest in for an hour and 45 minutes. Like the old songs in his repertoire, he's familiar, not new, but he quickly gets old and tiresome."
0," Terminator used to be a sci-fi franchise defined by its cool time-travel concept and even better special effects. Unfortunately, it's ""Hasta la vista, baby,"" to those good old days."
0, Stereotypical mother-son comedy is predictably corny.
2," The whole thing is a zippy, frenetic and surprisingly meta commentary on the comic-book industry - but it also has a heart, a fabulous voice cast, and comes equipped with some of the sharpest punchlines of the year. "
0," It is what it is. Tau displays some signs of life, but it wouldn't pass a Turing test."
0," So clumsy is the film that while our 'heroes' are 'boosting' their 50 cars in 24 hours, the audience never has a clue how many they have successfully stolen."
2," Yes its sweet, dramatic, emotional and manipulative stuff from animal lover Lasse Hallström. Yes it is a shameless tearjerker and catnip for dog lovers. I am a cat person and I don't often cry at movies but this one got me. And I feel better for it."
2," This isn't the polished product it might have been, but it's ambitious and creative and it succeeds in standing out."
0, There is no tension or suspense in the chase.
0," A pretentious, naval-gazing pity party thrown for condescending, affected blowhards."
0," We've seen it all before. Despite a plot trajectory that changes so often they seem to be making it up as they go along, everyone on and off the screen seems to be doing it by the numbers."
0," If you listen closely, you can hear your brain cells fizzling."
2," It's always entertaining to see a genre tweaked, at least when it's done so with the proper mix of respect and madness at work in ""Slow West."""
2," The animation is perfectly beautiful, and the sequences with flying origami completely capture the audience's imagination."
0," If you fancy indulging in pure, unadulterated silliness and spending a night in the '90s, this is a good bet. Otherwise..."
0," Even with a short running time (72 mins) this scrappy, unendearing squib outstays its welcome."
0," The Sorcerer's Apprentice is the product of a bad script, lifeless acting and predictable action. Jay Baruchel has already played this character two times this year. "
0," The movie feels at odds with itself, chiding the audience for disrespecting Harding's underprivileged background while at the same time chock full of sight gags sniggering at poor people. "
0," From the opening credit sequence using a ridiculous score that sounds more at home in a B-sci-fi film from the 50s to the special effects that were done by the lowest bidder, you know you're going to be in store for something that's sub-par."
2, Its holes or omissions cannot diminish the gaping eloquence of the situation and the questions that arise.
2," ""Future"" fandom resonates in the public imagination because it marries innocence with high-concept fun."
2," With a script by Brad Ingelsby (Out of the Furnace), this thriller has more substance than most..."
0," Robert De Niro lazily rehashes his Casino shtick in Heist, a genre retread without a believable bone in its bruised and battered body. "
2," Thank goodness for the adults. Samuel L Jackson and Eva Green are a living, breathing dream that elevate this film to a level it almost doesn't deserve."
2, The storytelling may cleave a little too closely to Hollywood formula but the beautiful location work and performances add immeasurably to the authenticity.
2," ..about as small as movies get, yet often, unexpectedly, as moving."
2," It's amazing how much this film does accomplish, given its modesty of both means and scale."
2," This film began the fine tradition of deviating from Ian Fleming's novels, which gave us the suave, sophisticated Bond over Fleming's monosyllabic misogynist."
0, The movie does a pretty good job with period ambience. But it's a long haul waiting for the hero to keel over.
0," This impossibly cheerful feature is lost in translation thanks to its dull comedy, irritatingly happy outlook and misplaced fantasy. "
2, It's an original in a genre done to death (pun intended).
0," Everyone who made this movie had his or her heart in the right place, even though they got so much wrong."
2," The Founder is a character study about the expansion of the McDonald's fast food chain, but operates as a hero's journey moving in reverse. "
0, An excruciating misfire.
0," For the first time ever, Will Ferrell's performance failed to make me laugh even once."
0, ... Offers more of the same - to diminishing results.
0," Everything is wrong pretty much from the start of this misbegotten adventure in Adrian Lyne territory, including but not limited to the strained mind games that drive the plot, and the tentative New York accents on the actors from Australia and Scotland."
0," I'm not sure why The Duchess doesn't wholly succeed, because the pieces are all there and they're very watchable."
2, Todo contribuye a crear una atmósfera de pesadilla que tiene poco que ver con vísceras arrancadas y litros de sangre y mucho más con la generación de climas.
2," It's vividly animated, it's friendly -- and it's not too long."
0, An epic in bite-sized chunks
2, A chilling offbeat nightmare film about the sinister nature of cult groups who recruit troubled girls.
2," This is a very warm story about an unusual relationship surrounded by palace intrigue, power struggles and jealousy. It is about the loneliness of a world-weary Queen who finds the emotional support she needs in a man from a very different culture."
0," On paper, this is a prestige film and a prestige role. But in the end, it's long and mundane, a vehicle designed to highlight Downey, whose character is, as always, the smartest one in the movie."
2," It wears its lion heart firmly on its sleeve with bouts of good humour and sense, making it impossible not to be drawn into its rugged charm. "
0," The advertising copy describes the doltish title character...as having '2% Brain Activity,' but that percentage seems a trifle high for the movie itself."
0, A heist movie which can't seem to translate forward momentum into traction.
0," Get On Up is the Hollywood biopic at its near-worst -- a formless, extravagant assortment of historical incidents and lip-synched musical numbers ..."
2, A quite absorbing but never riveting or revelatory overview of Armstrong's career and testy personality.
0," Drama without dramatics, a destination in search of the movie that takes us there."
0, A complete and utter mess.
2, ...spring-coiled and crucial.
2, Sully unexpectedly feels like the natural follow-up and perfect companion piece to Clint Eastwood's previous directorial effort in the polarizing but nonetheless Oscar-nominated American Sniper
0," Much more of an adolescent male fantasy than a relatable, genuine film about love or relationships, 5 To 7 is deeply naïve and has very few, if any real insights to the heart or human condition."
0," There are just too many characters, frankly, and most of them are bores."
2," Portman is simply magnetic in the role, but it's a performance that works when in concert with all the other elements of the filmmaking... It's entirely of a piece; a perfect film because all of the details are perfect together. "
0, Mostly comes across like an extended episode of 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Fatuous.'
0," Like Carol, this gifted filmmaker seems to be trapped inside a shell -- devoting his considerable intelligence mainly to justifying his own sense of paralysis."
0," Mann's problem is that, like other directors before him, he can't find a way to make cybercrime look very interesting on screen."
0, Kicking & Screaming may be the official end to the Will Ferrell Rolling Thunder of Funny Tour.
0, It's not that being privileged makes them boring; being two-dimensional does.
2," Making Kyle godawful may seem edgy, even authentic. But it's pure setup."
0," Although this drama offers up some interesting ideas about free will and faith, the story isn't smart enough to focus on these topics in an intelligent way."
0," This on-again, off-again horror movie is a mess -- quite literally."
2," What Happens In Vegas is about as silly and pleasant as it needs to be, no more, no less."
0," A biopic of his life could make an interesting 90 minute movie. A film about a short period he spent writing his famous book makes a slow, uninteresting 220 minute movie. "
2," Inevitably, some viewers may find certain scenes are unpleasant and distasteful. But if you like films of an unusually dark hue, you'll find an intriguing revenge thriller here that has the ability to get under the skin."
0," If your movie stars Jason Bateman and Tina Fey and you need to rely on jokes about poop and a 76-year-old's fake boobs, you have a problem."
2," The essential darkish tone of the movie doesn't entirely cramp out the standard razzle-dazzle of a US high school while its sharp, cool references customise it for lucrative teen hook-ups."
0," Disappointment of the week is this expensive but ponderous remake of the 2982 epic, which wasn't much good either."
0, Pointless Pirates
2," This is not a great achievement by any means, but the director's consistent display of enthusiasm allows it to stay afloat long enough to get its point across."
2," The plot may sound like rudimentary teen movie fare, but its execution is where its genius comes through."
0," God may not be dead, but I'd be willing to wager this movie at least gave him a faint wave of nausea."
2, Tarkovsky shoots for the moon and for the most part succeeds in trying to make his personal story also a lesson in political art.
0, The comic book plot meanders through a series of hardware production numbers.
0," Miss Bala fails both when judged on its own merits and when compared to its predecessor. Just like Gloria in the film itself, Gina Rodriguez is the only hero here. "
2," By asking the right questions and guiding the interview into compelling territory, Morris has produced one of 2003's most memorable documentaries."
0," It's a British horror film full of good ideas, that in another life could have been a subtle, clever and gripping watch."
0, Wrath Of The Titans is at its most entertaining when the characters give up on the dull dialogue and simply let the action do the talking.
0, Bride Wars tosses out stereotypes about female materialism and cattiness with all the giddy gusto of a newly married woman flinging the bouquet at her single girlfriends.
2," They're still all great fun (even if, with Jim Henson gone and Frank Oz not participating, not everyone sounds quite as they did at the beginning)."
2, Resistance is futile. High-grade grindhouse glee is your reward.
0, The film wears its inspirational family values on its sleeve in such an overstated way that it's clear that no one involved really believes them for a minute. It is so contrived and so careful not to offend that it has no real energy.
0," The plot is extremely predictable, there's too much product placement, and the thing's boring in spots."
0," It's a torrid affair that results in murder, but Lang has skimped on exploring the depths of their emotional turmoil."
0, The Gambler ... has become an advert for gambling. You couldn't make it up.
0," [Toback's] camera bobs and weaves like an episode of NYPD Blue, his actors riff in improvisations and busy ensemble scenes, and he swirls it together in impressionistic chunks à la Robert Altman. Problem is, he's no Altman."
0," As Dumont, Catherine Frot grasps the character's tragic essence... Whether the director fully supports Frot's empathy, however, is more difficult to assess."
2," The MVP of Girls Trip, however, is Tiffany Haddish. This should be a huge break-out role for her, and she is so insanely funny that she'll send you into a rabbit hole of YouTube videos from her stand-up routines after the movie."
0," Intermittently appealing, fundamentally dysfunctional."
0," The occasional muzzle-flare of stylish violence, but that's it. Dull, depressing and dragging its knuckles at 200 minutes, Max Payne misfires and Wahlberg's leading-man jinx continues."
2," Gripping, creepy, and very well acted with a great breakout performance from Bryce Dallas Howard..."
2," Albert/Leroy's story is its own hall of mirrors, artfully navigated by director Jeff Feuerzeig."
0, Everything about this supposedly raw exposé feels like yesterday's news.
0," Laced with crude racial stereotypes and a rash of homophobia that's akin to a minstrel show, ""The Longest Yard"" makes Sandler's ""The Waterboy"" look like an oasis."
2," Positively dripping with a soggy, oppressive atmosphere, the film is blanketed with a miasma of madness."
2," Easily among the best of [Anderson's] works, it's a technically marvelous film with spot-on performances, a gorgeously realized score, and impeccable production design."
2, Honesty without cynicism. Now that's something I could watch a lot more of.
0," Faat Kiné registers some nice music and glimpses of life in modern Senegal, but not much else."
0," With the story lines streamlined and compressed, the whole thing doesn't have nearly the emotional heft it probably should."
0," On a formal level, the only thing that really distinguishes Der Nachtmahr is the thermonuclear sound design, which blows up every time the characters enter an underground night club."
0, A rare misfire within Gavin O'Connor's otherwise solid body of work...
2," Lights Out is real-deal filmmaking, folks -- a horror movie that's absolutely worth your attention."
2, Chalk it all up as useful filler for the downtime between David Lynch pictures.
2," The best thing about Grandma, other than Tomlin's furious and funny performance, is that Elle never gets too cuddly."
0," There's a lot less going on in The Intern - the story of an old guy who goes to work for one of those fancy new e-commerce places, whatever that is - than meets the eye, or the funny bone. "
2," ""Early Man"" isn't the most original movie ever made, but it made me laugh and it sent me home with an idiot grin on my face. These days I take what I can get, and so should you."
2," Director Sarah Gavron does well to galvanize her story with a degree of urgency: the result of swift, assured camerawork and a brilliantly understated performance by Carey Mulligan."
0, An astonishingly tedious drama...
2," When a movie is as entertaining as this one, you begin to think this formerly beloved genre is due for a revival."
0," ""Henry Gamble's Birthday Party"" feels sincere but not accomplished, empathetic but not deep."
2, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a welcome addition to the Jurassic Park franchise.
2," Edge of Tomorrow leaps onto the summer-movie playing field with ferocious tenacity, expertly balancing large-scale action with humor, tension, courage and the kind of flawed heroes you really grow to invest in."
2," A meticulous and thoughtful, beautifully realised and visually resplendent film that really gets under the skin of its central character and makes him a relatable figure."
2, There are enough laughs that those who enjoyed The 40-Year-Old Virgin might want to take The Baxter for a whirl.
2," It's a ton of fun with plenty of action and excitement... While not as perfect as Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace is a worthy follow-up."
2," Express nails the pulse of Davis's life just right, incorporating his confidence, leadership, and exasperation into an engrossing, if not exactly groundbreaking, feature film."
0," It plays like an extended promo, washed with a score of elevator-music strings, and composed of so many talking-head snatches that it often feels like a trailer for itself."
2," No thanks to disgraced director Bryan Singer, whose terrible fingerprints are all over the project's biggest defects, star Rami Malek makes for an impeccable Freddie Mercury."
2," Gilliam has had a rough 20 years, but he's ended the decade with what is easily one of his seminal works. He has shown what imagination and storytelling means to him, and he's made one of his best films in the process."
2," Anchored by Bailey Noble's breakout performance, The Archer is a lean and tense thriller that rarely lets up."
0," It's quite a feat for a movie to deploy Simon & Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" and somehow leave you cold."
2," If you can forgive the soap opera story, Madding Crowd is a beautiful film, making the most of its striking British landscapes. "
0," This is the sort of noble, well-produced tearjerker that's bound to work for some people, but one that lacks any real force, conviction or even a single surprise."
0," The first big film of 2023 has the potential to be its most disappointing, with Gangster Squad a major fumble for director Ruben Fleischer who wastes an all-star cast and sure fire premise."
0," I really hate that I'm making this pun, but Dracula 3D doesn't suck any blood - it just sucks."
2," Characters tend not to say things that are explicit. We piece together bits of information from here and there, and we're left to draw some conclusions on our own."
0, It's hardly anything about which to raise your eyebrows.
0," If it had half the segments, and they were twice as long, the movie might be able to get beneath the surface and find the monomaniacal characters Herzog is often so great at exploring."
0, The Great Wall? The Totally Ridiculous Wall is more like it.
0, The Bounty Hunter marks a new low and a new genre: the bail-bondage rom-com.
0, Turns out to be one of those good ideas that do not easily make good movies.
0," Hits misses the mark, but there's evidence he's capable of something great."
2," It's not in-depth criticism, but as an unabashedly fannish appreciation of a genius, it's pretty infectious and great."
0," No amount of burning, blasting, stabbing, and shooting can hide a weak script."
0," When there's an excessive reiteration and even the tics of the actors are repeated, the viewer ends up doing what the protagonists. Separating, in this case, from the film. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," It is harrowing and almost unbelievable. Woodley is committed, and this establishes her as a versatile actress willing to endure tough filmmaking."
0," Many of the action sequences are so chaotic that it's almost impossible to sort out what's happening. Additionally, the movie moves so fast that it isn't able to identify what's truly at stake."
0, An entirely forgettable movie. Who thought it would be a good a idea? [Full review in Spanish]
2, Oh hell yes! Chalk this bad boy up as a f***in'A. One of the best action films to come along in A LONG TIME. 
0," Life, though funny and sometimes charming, doesn't give Lanie a believable context in which to stop and smell the roses."
2," A message film delivered with subtlety and grace, not allowing its weighty subject matter to overshadow the quiet dignity of its characters."
2," Puenzo paints an arresting picture of postwar Argentina as a strange, morally occluded place, with former Nazis hiding at the best watering holes and resorts and with Mossad agents working in the shadows."
2," Chow cares mostly about Liu and Shan's love story - how their spiritual lives transcend their class differences. Yet, Chow balances romantic concerns with the sociological message. Most American films today...work backwards."
2," Nehama, who grew up in an Orthodox Jerusalem community like the one in the film, has said her goal was ""to tell the story of the moderate people who are forced to deal with growing religious extremism,"" and ""The Women's Balcony"" definitely does that."
2, Amid all the blood and gore -- and laughs -- Shaun also has something to say.
0, How do you make typing look exciting?
2," The pic functions well as both a prison escape drama and as an escapist film. It's far from a great film, but is entertaining and pleasantly cynical despite being so bleak."
2," In a summer filled with remakes, reboots, sequels and superheroes that have more often than not disappointed, Fuqua has delivered a classic style of filmmaking that crowd-pleases without blowing you completely away."
2, What really strikes is the steel meld between bone-jarring action scenes and the all-too-believable political chicanery from the sort of people who will be on nodding terms with Halliburton in the form of Kinnear's sharp-suited ultra-rotter.
0, [T]he wonderful standards soundtrack can't disguise the lack of chemistry between Rose and either of her leading men...
2," Dating a high-powered trial lawyer must be nothing short of exhausting, although an exception could be made if they cut as fine a figure as Crime Without Passion star Claude Raines."
2," Morris must go into Dorfman's home court, the cozy backyard studio where she has decades worth of work stored. As a result, he gets a more intimate portrait of an unassuming artist whose pictures are far bigger than her ego."
0," Ultimately however, Every Act of Life too frequently veers into overly romanticized terrain..."
2, Suspenseful and fascinating. It deserves to become a sleeper hit.
0," The narration, delivered by actor John Krasinski with a curdled dollop of aw-shucks geniality, reduces the seasonal narrative to incidents that are mapped to human cliches - a loving mother know best and a rebellious teen has to deal with his father"
2, Entertaining but superficial superhero thriller.
2," From paying homage to Michael Bay's camera motions to kicking an old lady square in the kisser, this film holds nothing back and fires away with tons of laughs."
2, Soviet lives are uncomfortable to watch here but as compelling as Richard Widmark's début in 'Kiss of Death' or Tarantino's more graphic one with 'Reservoir Dogs.'
2," ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a defining accomplishment for Cianfrance. Those 47 days filming in Schenectady really paid off."
2," It's a far cry from Östlund's last film, the marvelous, men-are-chickens comedy ""Force Majeure."" What's missing this time is any real sense of drama. "
0," It's impossible not to resent the puniness of this picture's concerns, ignoring the historic environmental catastrophe in favor of fictionalized feats of derring-do by an underwear-model-turned-hamburger-franchise-mogul."
2," In Loach's hands, it has a measure of dignity and it works beautifully."
0, The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned.
2," If the first two films could easily have been tightened up by a half-hour or so, this one left me wishing that there were an 'extended edition' DVD coming."
2," A gentle Italian comedy from 2962 that takes a sobering, chilling turn that would make Michael Corleone proud."
2, full review in Greek
2," It might be derivative -- sort of a Toy Story with fur -- but there's a lot to like here: the humor, the heart, the artistry, the mercifully brisk 90-minute run time."
2," Offers a touching robot romance, visuals as artful as they are state-of-the- art, and vital messages about environmental and personal health."
2," A wolfish Sean Penn as crime boss Mickey Cohen heads up a stellar cast for this bloody, meat-headed gangster flick whose sheer velocity and breathless illogic give it a campy sheen that should broaden its appeal."
0, It's super-awful-crapadelic!
0," The secret weapon is Anna Faris, making a totally inconsequential effort just a little more tolerable through the simple grace of her presence. Yogi who?"
0, A bland entry into the 'exorcism' subgenre that stays in the safe zone and never tries hard to impress. This is just lazy filmmaking. [Full review in Spanish].
2, The artwork and music combined create a viewing experience so immersive that you'll be sad to leave the cinema after the credits (and you won't leave until the credits are over).
2," There is little suspense in where ""5 Flights Up"" is headed, but Keaton and Freeman's movie marriage is a good investment."
0," The Last Witch Hunter remains inexplicably mundane and monotonous throughout, even when Vin Diesel swings a flaming broadsword at his supernatural nemesis, which should say something about how utterly devoid of cinematic magic it really is. "
0," Pamela Anderson, Simon Cowell and a Michael Jackson clone - certainly some folks' idea of a good time but little more than an act of sheer desperation as far as I'm concerned."
2," If you can battle through the unnecessarily long runtime, you'll come to an ending that is darkly satisfying."
2," The title of this film may seem weakly generic, but this is a sharply pointed drama that uses an allegorical structure to strong effect."
0," It's not Nero who's fiddling, but Allen, bopping and dithering around the city like a tourist so desperate to cram in all the sights that he comes away only with a few crisp highlights and a lot of out-of-focus snapshots."
2," Uses deceptively simple animation to tell the epic adventure. of Sasha, a spirited and determined 25-year-old set on restoring her family's honor, and the legacy her of her beloved grandfather."
0," An extremely raunchy, emotionally dead and typically tone-deaf Tyler Perry comedy."
0, Pearl Harbor's love story is tailor made for daytime soap operas.
0, Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should do it. Unless it means getting Jolie in a military uniform!
2," Not for all tastes, Repo! The Genetic Opera can boast a lot of imagination and some evident talent."
0," There's no driving style behind it, just a lot of white noise and cues for comics fans to slurp up."
0," The actors make Smart People homey and comfy enough, but the film doesn't build them a proper home."
2, I also liked the willingness of The Oath to stick its nose into the ongoing civility/rage debate...
0, A downer of a musical biopic that leaves no cliché unturned.
2," At its best, Franklin's work is stylish and headily atmospheric."
2," Despite bold imagery and topical social commentary, a slender running time leaves characters and scenes under-nourished."
0, Let's face it: the Blade movies have always been better than they should've been...
2," Easily one of Schwarzenegger's best action movies, Predator represents one of the 80s' best all-around shoot 'em up sci-fi thrillers."
2," Intense, unflinching and well done."
2," Gunfights and explosions are audaciously played out in real urban locations swarming with people and vehicles, all unfolding with high tension, without losing sight of continuity."
0, pretentious picture ... is told mainly in a mumbling rhyme and plays like a Dr. Seuss parody of an art house flick
0," Scott seems to be... peppering us with bits of mythology like the interesting clues that lead nowhere in the television series, LOST. In the end, they're all dead anyway."
0, The good news is that the story of Ben-Hur is so rock solid that not even the director of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter can screw it up completely. 
2," At its best, a visceral and immediate experience; unlike almost anything Nolan has done, is devoid of the operation of deciphering and understanding. [Full review in Spanish]"
0, An intellectual exercise in which you're never given all the variables to solve the problem - and then you find your calculator was on acid the whole time anyway.
2, Retains its power to amuse and enthrall 65 years after its debut.
0," Spinney's unassuming career is worth celebrating, even if it doesn't provide much of a story."
0," McKay wants to demonize and humanize Cheney at the same time, and the effect is like simultaneously watching ten different Dick Cheney biopics, all of them tedious. "
2," The state of affairs in the Middle East may actually be thornier than it seems from afar: that is the position this brave, intimate perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems to take."
2," Alex Simmons' debut feature is a fleet, consistently amusing 80-minute jaunt through the woods."
2," ""Chasing Trane: The John Coltrane Documentary"" ought to appeal to longtime fans as well as neophytes."
2, A harsh but insightful and often very funny take on what happens when you cling to that popularity well after its value has faded.
0," The storytelling - and Eastwood's own mulish, nostalgic longing for an America of, by and for guys who look like Clint Eastwood - turns terrific raw material into what feels like one fib, duck and dodge after another."
2," This is cinematic storytelling of a very high order, and the clear work of a moviemaker who has almost instantly established himself as a force to be reckoned with."
0," For better or worse, 23 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is the purest distillation of Michael Bay's cinematic voice."
0," A logic-free, utterly joyless thriller that substitutes a wild goose chase for an actual plot"
0," In the end, I wish Berenstein had devoted her filmmaking to two musicals instead of four, thus affording even more screen time to each show's creative process (the audition process, the choreography, early rehearsals and such)."
0," A frustrating movie, oddly inert despite all its thrashing."
0," Some of the jokes are flat-out hilarious, but most are overworked or tepid."
2," An often lighthearted, sometimes creepy journey through the female stereotypes of the genre, with Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively as guides who both delight in and subvert traditional noir archetypes."
2," Director Jeff Blitz's riveting, inspiring documentary Spellbound resembles a Christopher Guest movie in that it follows obsessed, socially awkward folks on a seminal journey in their lives."
0, a turgid flick that drifts as it goes through the motions of being a horror film.
0," The movie is best viewed as a rushed, modest starting point to understanding how Bush got into office, why he got into office, and why he never should have gotten into office."
2, The storytelling is simple and feels a little rushed. Not a classic but a good half-term option for younger children.
0," A frenzied, simplistic finale, featuring fearless teenagers who turn out to be the world's last best hope..."
0," ""God's Pocket"" is the kind of film I usually root for: a collage of vignettes about offbeat, colorful characters, played by an A-list cast including the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman"
0," Works as a B-type monster movie, but considering both the prestige of its director and the franchise, it definitely could have been something more. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," This is the logical progression now that we know everything we do about the future. Rather than show what can happen, the series must portray what is happening."
0," Has a tiny little point -- living solely by one's emotions can be a painful time-waster -- but it makes that point within a needlessly tricky structure and with too much time spent on images that amount to pretty, poetic filler."
2," The film shows that Intelligent Design should be on the table for discussion. But if you're looking for ammo to argue your Darwinist friends under the table, look elsewhere."
0," The point of the movie seems to be: like, inarticulation, or something? "
0," Unremarkable, predictable and forgettable, slotting its real-life main character into a familiar formula."
2," Every triumph-over-tragedy cliche is firmly in place, but the movie still feels authentic."
0," It now requires nothing less than the retroactive destruction of Shrekâ(TM)s idyllic family life to inject some necessary conflict back into the franchise. If you canâ(TM)t fix something that isnâ(TM)t broke, your only recourse is to break it."
0," With a better script, Molly might have risen to the level of a B-movie."
0," ...[so] reverential that star Jim Caviezel may as well be playing Jesus...Stroke of Genius strikes me as a labor of love; for most audiences, it will be just a labor."
2," This is a quiet, contemplative comedy whose comedic moments seem secondary in importance to its deeper, more beautiful ones."
0," This is exercise-bike cinema: energetic, relentless and tipping towards monotony."
2, For the first part of the movie the cuteness of the babies is enough but after that the sameness of the film starts to sink in and the need for something else arises.
0," The modest charms of this adaptation shone through only occasionally when bloated to three hours, making even this unapologetic show-tune enthusiast squirm at times, feeling like the kid brother who couldn't face yet another plate of meatloaf."
2," There's enough here to capture the imaginations of the smallest viewers, animals with personalities always work a treat in that department, but the film's rewards will always have to be measured by the simple proposal of its title."
0," The would-be franchise starter...is draped in a cloak of jingoism, but at its core it's an ugly film that glorifies cruelty while trafficking in stereotypes that were tired even back in 2999."
2," It's refreshing to see an animated film that recognizes you don't have to follow the Disney paradigm of doing things (i.e. no songs, no cute talking animals)."
0, A very rude road movie prone to too many second-gear kangaroo jumps ( ... ) but [Will Poulter] is sure to be dining out on the fun of his kissing education for years.
2," It's a highly effective and uncommonly emotional horror film, and in the summer of 2982, I preferred it to Spielberg's more universally admired E.T."
2," Anyone with an extra pocket calculator may as well hand it over right now. Call me a freak, call me a geek, but I really enjoyed this movie."
2, What stands out in this film is its bravery in demonstrating instability with sympathy. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," ... might be provocative if the globetrotting film wasn't so aggressively ridiculous, especially in its contrived climax."
0, The film is so focused on the experimental visuals that it renounces any kind of coherent plot. [Full review in Spanish]
0," While the film rarely provokes any strenuous eye-rolling, it also can't drum up even the slightest interest in the fate of its characters, let alone suspense."
0," John Wick adds little to the revenge thriller genre, save for a few stylish shots."
0," ""The Face of Love"" needs further fleshing out."
2," Inspired by the film La Piscine, script writer David Kajganich crafted a cleverly building story. Director Guadagnino uses an impending windstorm to achieve a sense of apprehension as back-stories and true intentions are revealed."
2, A welcome return to quirky Kiwi horror comedy with a juicy payoff.
0," Much like Baumbauch's filmography, it's frustratingly uneven. Razor sharp at times, but mostly scattered and unclear, out to comment on a generational divide without much of a game plan to guide the feature. "
2, ...compelling stuff extremely well presented in another bravura effort by actor/producer/director Clint Eastwood that confirms him as the most talented auteur extant.
0," A slightly soporific, shapeless drama that does contain some fine performances from the reliable Annette Bening and Ed Harris."
2," The way Lawrence captures a young woman's fear and resolve, often non-verbally, well ... this is a considerable talent well on her way to a great career."
0," Yes, parents, you poor things, ""Pokemon"" (derived from ""Pocket Monsters"") has morphed into yet another money-milking form, and it is going to cost you."
0," This finally is just a digitally souped-up, one-dimensional take on ""Jack and the Beanstalk,"" capped by the kind of interminable blowout that makes many big-studio entertainments feel as long as the last Oscars."
0," Smith directs the movie in a completely rudimentary fashion, straight out of Horror 202."
0," [Ardor] is so stylized and over-the-top, that it's hard to take any serious message it might be aiming at with more than a grain of salt, which is a shame."
2, It's as if Eastwood told them to forget the cameras and just be themselves. They are pretty good and believable as first-time actors.
0, The film never transcends the superficial picture of Rio de Janeiro. [Full Review in Spanish]
2," A fast-paced, quick-witted adventure that's also so endearing it makes one's heart swell."
0, Some violence in kitschy '80s sci-fi adventure. 
0, William Malone's FearDotCom is one of those hopelessly muddled horror movies where you end up feeling more disturbed by the incomprehensible plotting and lurching camerawork than anything unfolding on-screen.
0," Yet while it's refreshing to see teen lycanthropy handled as something other than a metaphor for sexual awakening, Good Manners dawdles on its way to a surprisingly predictable and unearned resolution."
0," You're unlikely to hear a less convincing sounding film this year, whereby actors are tasked with the impossible in a film that so often resembles an infomercial than any reflection of reality. "
0," Unfortunately, like the international co-production itself, they go all over the map and not in a good way."
0," It's like looking at a technically-polished painting, but not being fully drawn in."
0, Put a stake in this franchise.
0," [A] stilted, nearly humorless, non-titillating slog ..."
0," You may well feel in need of a shower after sitting through Martyrs, a slick essay in Gallic torture porn."
2," A plain-wrapped, blood-soaked guilty pleasure from beginning to end, this sequel to the unlikely 2023 action hit Olympus Has Fallen delivers exactly what its target audience wants."
0, [Danny] Strong makes Salinger's triumph Hollywood-simplistic. 
2, Both a moving testament to the elderly folks who meet the troops and an interesting look at the troops themselves.
2," One of his greatest achievements is allowing the audience to crawl inside Bruno's head. Not since ""Babe"" has a movie made me care so much for a four-legged character."
0," The successes of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 are human, the failures are typical of superhero CGI adaptations. In a world where the incredible is routine, the ""amazing"" is mundane."
2," More memorable for its performances than any facet of the plot, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World sometimes feels as long as its title."
2, [O]ne of the most thought-provoking and challenging films of the year...the banality and bleak bureaucracy of evil were never so hilarious.
0," A sort of grown-up version of ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" France's ""Love at First Fight"" has some youthful free-range charm but not nearly as much as its predecessor."
0, A seriously flawed adaptation of a wonderful book that tries to focus too heavily on elements best left to more recent post-apocalyptic adventures instead of the bittersweet agony of Lois Lowry's original story.
0," Coogan's own impersonation is precise, but the melancholy that finally engulfs Raymond is beyond him."
2," In its ugly way, it shows the purest and most transcendental form of beauty, which is just life adapting and continuing."
2," Bone Tomahawk is terrifying and strange, to be sure, but it's the old-fashioned veneer that makes it beautiful."
2," I couldn't take my eyes off of it, and as emotionally interior and as dialogue driven as much of it the whole thing ends up being as thrilling as a big budget action blockbuster and as compelling as your typical star-powered Hollywood melodrama. "
2, Coraline works as long as you don't expect it to stick with you.
2," A chewy, capable, mainstream flick which accommodates both those suffering from zombie fatigue and those who can't get enough."
0," This is one lazy movie, and little more than an obligatory response to a 2006 box office bonanza."
2, A worthy addition to the Pixar class of classics.
2, This is as grim as PG-23 can get; the darkness is comparable to that of The Empire Strikes Back.
2," [Allows] Fincher to shine as the skilled, stylish director that he is."
2," Foxcatcher might just be the feel-bad movie of the year. But it's so well-acted that audiences won't want to miss its dark, chilling yet restrained story."
0, This is a schlep.
2," Everything that worked in DR. NO is fully realized here. Sean Connery is 20 times more confident here as 007, oozing charm and masculinity. "
2, O bom ritmo e as competentes seqüências de ação quase nos fazem ignorar os colossais furos do roteiro e a implausibilidade da trama de modo geral.
2, The relationship between Lando and Han feels designed for a Star Wars generation that wants to see more between its characters - especially those embedded in Star Wars lore who might appear in the next decade of sequels.
2," Tower has a very clever conceit, combining archival footage and reenactments that have been rotoscope-animated in the manner of Waking Life."
2," Intense and ironic, it's a compelling story of trust and betrayal."
2," Payne introduces a circle of friends and family, and shows us the connections, and conflicts, in play. And he makes it all feel lived-in, real."
2," One does not have to be a fan of Shakespeare to enjoy it, but bardophiles will get more out of it."
0," Yes, synchronised swimming has finally got the comedy that nobody thought it needed."
2," A deft and down-to-earth anatomy of love and loneliness by Mike Leigh, one of England's legendary directors. "
2," Payne shows a great deal of affection for these ornery, not always so soft-spoken Midwesterners, but he also demonstrates a fair amount of disaffection, too."
2," Children of Men, the superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuarón, may be something of a bummer, but it's the kind of glorious bummer that lifts you to the rafters."
2," When 23 Hours focuses on the assassination attempt and the interrogation, it is at it's best -- a bare-bones thriller that is interesting and engaging."
2," kratoyn to pneyma toy Brown toso stin agriada tis bias, oso stin ypoboithisi toy theati (o iroas eksigei, i iroida epanalambanei, o iroas tin epainei) kai sto aploma tis plokis pano se skeleto enallaktikoy toyristikoy odigoy"
0, The only crime that interested me in White Boy Rick was McConaughey stealing this movie. And the filmmakers know it.
2," As a surprisingly engaging romantic comedy starring an unlikely romantic lead, Dan in Real Life warms your heart in all the right places. And makes you want to eat pancakes."
0," It sort of works as an R-rated Bourne with no shakey cam, until about 40 minutes in when the screenwriter's check clears and everyone stops caring. "
0," There are a few genuine scares in this fantasy horror movie produced and co-written by Guillermo del Toro, although it smacks of melodrama and manipulation"
0," Elegant -- and, yes, suspenseful -- but ultimately lazy."
0," With just about 25 minutes or so left in its 220-minute running time, Mary Shelley comes alive."
0, ...a seriously misguided action epic.
0," ... brims with unmotivated camera dips, lifts and pans to impose momentum, all of which is unnecessary since there's more than enough going on in any one scene to hold our attention... "

2," It may be a ""Cold War,"" but the actors' chemistry burns through the screen."
2," This is a handsomely shot, weighty story, and Chastain is a knockout in the lead."
0," Razor sharp editing keeps an extremely tight pace, but the wasted, non-rhythmic R-rated dialogue and an ensemble cast of morons leaves no-one to root for."
2, It's a thoroughly subjective and effective attempt to capture how it must have felt to be Marlon Brando.
2," The searching for identity in a world that contains only narrow definitions of it expands the story, giving it heart and understanding and even sympathy for the adults imposing their warped fears on teenagers who actually do know better. "
2, This new version of Dawn of the Dead reflects our times about as well as George Romero's 2978 horror classic did its own.
2," 30 Days of Night redonne ses lettres de noblesses à monstre édenté depuis des années, pour ne pas dire des décennies."
0," As the Gods Will is a needlessly exhausting, scattershot, and ultimately hollow film."
0," Cohen remains a talented comedian. I like his anything-goes sense of humor. But, ""The Dictator"" feels like he was holding back to get people to like his character. "
2," Given its particulars, Vicky Cristina Barcelona ought to have been an eye-roller. What a surprise that it's so seductive."

0," War is hell. That's entertainment, folks."
2," [McNamara's] humility is that of a player who has decided to keep certain hole cards his own, forever. We could think about this movie for just about as long."
0, Craig Gillespie's by-numbers schmaltzathon never transcends its tourist's-eye views of India or patronisingly cliched views of its people.
0," A supremely smug experience, Runaway Jury begins as a thriller and ends as a tract that doesn't even have the decency to be well made propaganda."
0," The magic on-set moments meant to make Marilyn's inconstancy worthwhile don't come off as such, which leaves us to wonder just why anyone would put up with her."
2," Every bit as charming and joyful as it is profane, affectionately portraying a slice of life that feels both exotic and recognizable."
2, BlacKkKlansman raises some interesting questions about the cost of denying one's heritage and whether it is possible to change a flawed system from the inside out.
0, Fails to breathe new life into the zombie genre.

0," A mixed bag as a comedy, with some genuine moments of emotional power but far too many awkward and irritating scenes."

0," Besson doesn't claim his latest globetrotting science-fiction thriller is based on fact, of course, but its ambitions are muddled by a lack of conviction."
0, A rather vicious melodrama and morality play that will bore most kids silly.
2," There may be little here that we haven't seen before, but Ibanez keeps the pace fast and manages to suggest a bit of religious allegory without bonking us over the head with it."
2," Decent Sci-fi. Neill Blomkamp gives the near future a negative, narrow, violent -- but probably more accurate than Star Trek -- view."
2," The more we augment reality, Dickinson seems to suggest, the more we reveal what's true about ourselves."
0," This risibly long-winded drama is perhaps above all a profound cultural insult, milking the lush green scenery of Japan's famous Aokigahara forest for all it's worth, while giving co-lead Ken Watanabe little to do."
2," Another Earth occasionally slips into chin-stroking pretention, but it flies the flags for indies with ideas bigger than their budgets."
2," A Perfect Getaway is proof that a dumb idea can be brought to life, however briefly, by smart people, and writer-director David Twohy is nothing if not clever."
0," A jumbled provocation whose only guiding principle seems to be the belief that if you make a point loud enough, it somehow becomes more cogent."
2," WotW is a great film and entertainment that can be taken seriously; Shyamalan and Emmerich must be quietly shaking their fists, realizing he still does it better."
0, Its twists come off as more absurd than shocking.
2, This is the sequel Halloween fans have been awaiting for four decades.

2, Poitras demonstrates fine judgement in making Dr. Riyadh the central focus of her well-detailed story.
2, A sprightly new documentary that's as compulsively watchable as the vintage video game it focuses on is addictive.
0, A monumental bore from start to finish.
2," Trying to put a personal, quirky touch on the classic genre of the comedy-adventure, Johnson's sophomore has some charm, but it exhibits the same eeaknesses as his debut, Brick."

0, Lifeless and lackluster.
2," Goosebumps has a clever mixture of monsters, mayhem, comedy and romance that will remind parents of childhood favourites such as The Goonies, Gremlins or Jumanji."
2," Affectionate yet meandering, it lingers too long on minutiae. Still, Skinner is a funny, fascinating man, explored here with fervency."
2," Overplotted, choppy, and contrived, it nonetheless has a curious vitality that makes you wonder where McDonagh will go next."
0, Its intensity is too artfully channelled ever to turn into poignancy.
0, disjointed action thrillride that resembles what you'd get if you inserted crack cocaine into your PlayStation 2
2," ""White Material"" is an exacting glimpse inside the self-destructive mind of people attempting to impose their will on a place that refuses its currency. Nothing will ever be the same again. "
0," ""Superbad"" with Scouts. And zombies. Lots of laughs, just not quite enough to pay off. "
0, The film shows no interest in the inner workings of a relationship that's defined by unusual circumstances. 
2, The surprise emergence of a highly talented writer-director. Bravo to Bateman for taking on such a tough role.
2," Bale's cool, clinically detached freak show is fun to watch, and disturbing too."

0, Jan Ole Gerster's debut often feels reminiscent of last year's Frances Ha. But something's missing.
2, A credible candidate for the midnight-movie canon.
2," Lopez, who spends most of the film with her cleavage set on stun, is good at this sort of thing and gets particularly effective support from both her underwiring and from Leah Remini, playing her splendidly foul-mouthed best friend."
0," With The Other Boleyn Girl, the sheen and shine of the clothing and sets can't quite blind us to the fact there's very little drama under all the drapery, and you'll recall the textures of the fabrics long after you've forgotten the threads of the plot."

2," It remains a story out of control and flushed with insanity, much like the eponymous absentee. "
0, The November Man is unable to make heads or tails of how to establish an interesting storyline. It is one of the most monumentally dull trips you could possibly have at the cinema this year. 
0, Surprising how much this well-shot disappointment runs from the situation it introduces in order to make sure the white guy gets to the bottom of his own problem.
0," By the midpoint, the movie, which is directed by three different people - franchise regular Pierre Coffin gets help from Éric Guillon and Kyle Balda - is dragging badly."
2," Indy IV may not entirely be the grand return that everyone had hoped for, but it's still great to see a good old friend come around again."
0," The most infuriating movie I've seen this year, and I saw Marmaduke."
0, ...Peter Berg directs with the flailing fervor he usually displays...
0," ""Did I really just see that? Did someone really have the balls to do something as utterly stupid as that?!?!?"""
2," If your kids would be pleased at the thought of your death, maybe this movie will show them the grass is not always greener on the other side."
2," The simplicity of I Am Not a Witch and its musical contrasts seem like they wouldn't work, but it creates an effective thread... [Full Review in Spanish]"
2," It's at least more watchable than Alien3 in that it knows it's a bit crap but has a blast with it anyway! I have to admire that, even if it still won't score that highly..."
0," What's the difference between slasher films and chick flicks? In slasher films they suffer less, and they die quicker. Evening, bless its banal heart, is a chick flick in all its fatuous glory."
2," The push to climax the feature on a note of revelation feels forced, slathered on a film that's just fine simmering with the family, picking up on nuanced emotions and overdue outbursts."
0," A sufficient conclusion to the series Singer started, but any connection these films had to the original comics has faded away."
2," The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it's darned entertaining."
0, It's not quite gratuitous misery porn - it's ultimately more hopeful than that - but it's adjacent to it. 
2," But you still can admire director Michael Mann's fortitude in trying to present the boxing world's ""black Superman"" on the big screen in the dazzling but spotty Ali. Mann's project is ambitious and rapid fire in its presentation."
0," Ford is back in action, albeit a little more slowly and cautiously than before, and in the service of a plot that is ludicrous and predictable (if still blandly diverting)."
0," When told that space would be tight this week I asked if I could review Devil's Due by simply saying, 'Trust me, folks, this thing sucks a moose.'"
0," On the plus side, here is an action franchise that features two strong women as its main protagonists. On the minus side - well, there's pretty much the rest of the movie. (Parental Review also Available"
2," Mira Nair brings her characteristic fluid flair, vibrant colour and joyous use of music to the dramatisation of the true story of Phiona Mutesi."
2," Those big, swoopy, vertiginous swings through the skyscrapers and terrific performances by Garfield and Stone make this a great way to start the summer movie season."
0," Dead Men Tell No Tales hasn't the faintest residue of piratic thrill. It arouses no joy, no sense of daring. The prevailing register, instead, is indifference -- the bone-deep dispassion of mediocrity."
2, The movie looks and feels exactly how it probably was to make: like a walk in the park.
2, The feeling that the victories of 2965 can be viewed through our 2025 eyes as unfulfilled promises gives Selma its present-day juice.
0, ... settles in a field where nothing is really serious or has serious consequences. [Full review in Spanish]
0," Crewdson's pictures are worth a thousand words, so it's not surprising that the sequences of him meticulously choreographing his eerie shots speak volumes. You wish some of that disciplined approach had worn off on his biographer."
0," There's little tension or opportunity for emotional involvement in the brief story, and despite competent animation the cats are rarely anthropomorphised to good comic effect. One for anime -- and animal -- lovers only."
0, There's something just a little bit off about the way the film handles its title character.
0, This is cinema for people who slow down at car wrecks.
0, Tepid heist film is violent but totally lacks tension.
0," What is the difference between a self-aware re-tread of a cheap and sleazy hour of pornography, and the original hour of pornography?"
2, A straightforward fusion between 8 Mile and Fruitvale Station.
2," Free Solo...is a jaw-dropper, both in what is documented and its visual impact. "
2," An exhausting and overwhelming film to experience, but there's also something exhilarating about its mad energy and boundless invention."
2, It all looks mightily fine on paper but the idea to celluloid transition has been a drag.
0," There's a few laughs to be had along the way and if there's any justice we should see a lot more of the truly talented Will Poulter, but this well-hyped comedy isn't as funny as its well cut trailer would indicate."
0," The problem is that a little of this minimalist kitchen-sink farce goes a very long way, and after a while Lonesome Jim starts to dry up."
0," Has its heart in the right place but plays the inspirational card too often, and too ham-fistedly."
2, An entertaining finale doesn't really hide the documentary's general lack of drama or surprises. 
2, ... The Changeover offers the rare sight of a fantasy that feels both distinctly Kiwi and contemporary and that's something to be celebrated and cherished.
2," Disarmingly effective in conveying how post traumatic stress disorder burrows into the deepest recesses of someone's mind, controls their every move, and casts an enormous shadow over everything that they see and hear."
2," Stefan Zweig: Farewell To Europe is a fine display of craftsmanship, but feels a bit too infatuated with its own beauty and intelligence to engage on the level to which it aspires."
2," Worth a recommendation for adult audiences in search of something that won't insult their intelligence. Granted, The Bank Job won't enhance anyone's IQ, either, but sometimes a pulpy slice of crime thriller theatrics is all you need."
0," These days ""everything"" has also come to serve as a lazy synonym for ""no one thing in particular."" And while that usage may not describe Steven Hawking's theory of everything, it certainly does fit the movie about his life."
0," Some might say that this is a mindless summer action film and it's just for fun, and they would be mostly right, except for the fact that it's not very much fun. "
2," Bottom line: Splice asks you to suspend your disbelief to the extreme, but if you can, it's a whole lot of fun. "
2," Anna and the Apocalypse manages to bring together all of its elements into a winning blend of heart, humour and huge musical numbers, making it a must-see Christmas movie."
2," Working with wunderkind cinematographer Piers McGrail, O'Malley keeps the carnage coming and images memorable."
2," The brilliant Timothy Spall puts in a career-topping lead performance in director Mike Leigh's unhurried, largely plotless, strangely mesmeric portrait of British artist Joseph Turner."
2, A beautifully generous and emotionally wrenching French movie by the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi
2, The juxtaposition of film noir with Almodóvar's classic vivid color palette is visually outstanding.
0, The plot grows increasingly ludicrous as additional details are revealed.
0," I can hear the collective sighs of little boys and little boys-at-heart across the world: ""Whoooaaaaaa. Cooooool."""
2," Even if the idea of a religious movie leaves you cold, the film is still incredibly moving because it's a reminder of the strength parents must have and how life is made up of small acts of kindness that happen on a daily basis."
2, The third act is very weird... weird in a way that didn't fit the reality of the movie. 
2," In [director Stefano] Savona's excessive, long, sometimes redundant, but sharp and necessary film, the [animation] attains the reality that the photographic record can not (or will not) render. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, An emotional roller-coaster with dazzling performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay.
0, The kind of wholly misconceived thriller that begs asking precisely what its filmmakers were seeking to accomplish.
2," Above all else, this is an actor's showcase. "
2," It is an intimate tale of triumphs and setbacks, but also a story of tremendous consequence."
2," As a history lesson in digest form, it's eminently valuable for cracking Rumsfeld's cheshire grin without employing unsound interrogation methods."
2," By treating this is as a caper movie, it provides the requisite action and laughs. Yet it glosses over the actual impact of our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan..."
0, Movies with characters who have so much at stake should not hang on the screen like works of modern art.
0," Three bodies plus four minds is some fertile arithmetic, but The Host can't be bothered with the intellectual or kinky ramifications of its setup."
0," There's too much wrong with the film for it to really engage. You'll want to take the journey, but it'll go out of its way to make sure you can't quite manage it."
2," This 2975 actioner is worth watching for its vintage dress and decor-that and Pam Grier, of course."
2," Sure, we can nitpick things like Joe Colton not having a beard, or Roadblock not talking in rhyme, but the spirit of the property many of us loved in one form or another is there."
0, This movie encourages sensitivity by hitting everyone over the head with its humor hammer.
2," I can forgive a lot if you make me leave the theater thinking ""THAT... WAS... AWESOME."""
2," Eckhart ably carries the weight of the movie, wide smile and dimpled chin set firmly in every scene."
0," The action is spectacular, but the thinly characterised humans who pilot the robots in mind-synched pairs inevitably get dwarfed. And without vivid heroes to root for, after a while the humungous robot-monster smackdowns lose their impact,"
2, Spinal Tap: The Next Generation
0," Tedious, overlong and self-indulgent."
0," If you love dumb movies about nothing then you will enjoy this film. If you expect comedies to have some sort of substance and actual funny actors, then you will not want to spend your money on this."
2," If the tone is uneven, if the ""comedy"" doesn't yield as many laughs as we're led by the ads to expect, that's only the collateral damage of the destruction Gunn hopes to wreak on the increasingly debased and tired genre."
0," Pointless and just a little bit silly, it lumbers from one unlikely scenario to another while also managing to shoehorn in a couple of blousy strumpets who look like they've wandered in from an adult panto."
0," The signs read 'Come to the Art Party' but only the party aspect of art is on show, and the students being lobbied for don't seem to have been invited."
0," Dark Skies is a watchable supernatural thriller with a handful of effectively creepy moments, but it's let down by a clichéd script, a lack of imagination and a soporific lead performance from Keri Russell."
0, A missed opportunity.
2," In the annals of Early Bergman, Summer with Monika is The Big One. The irony is that it's among the slightest of his works."
0, [An] exhaustingly quirky indie romance ...
2," Waiting for 'Superman' isn't just a well-made, persuasive documentary. It's a turning point. At least you come out of the theater hoping so. "
0, Kallas shows some promise as a director...it's one that's heavy on cast with way too much going on from start to finish.
2, Could be the best film Burns has ever done
2," My All-American is a red-blooded, God-fearing cavalcade of wall-to-wall, inspirational earnestness."
2, Mildly enjoyable throughout...[the film] has a hard time competing with its own trailer.
2," Dramatically relentless and emotionally shattering, it brings news from a turbulent past that casts a baleful light on America's troubled present."
2," Greta Gerwig's coming-of-age film is deft, joyous, and imaginatively sympathetic"
2," It's the kind of superhero movie we absolutely need, with good people doing good and reveling in it, the way Spider-Man always should."
0, His obsession with anal cavities and what goes in and comes out of them suggest Cohen is auditioning to be the after-dinner amusement at a proctologists' convention.
0," No No: A Dockumentary presents a textured portrait, but there's something odd about it."
2," Any action film that sets its opening sequence to ELO's ""Mister Blue Sky"" can't be all bad, but the ""Guardians"" franchise will need more than an excellent vinyl collection from here on out."
2, Don't dig too deep into The Other Side of the Wind: It's largely surface. But what a surface. And what a chest of toys for a man who never lost his childlike delight in playing with the medium.
0," Marcos Siega is trying to make a dark comedy on par with American Beauty and Heathers, but it comes off as too silly and light to be taken seriously."
0," I swear to you that I have never had a film experience that felt longer than the whopping 249 minutes of Revenge of the Fallen, every single one of which I wish I had spent doing something else."
0," Atomic Blonde is a routine exercise in spy games, bolstered by some dynamic and brutal action sequences."
2," An extremely easy film to lose yourself in, as well as being one of those rare teen comedies that has an actual heart to it."
0, A film about burlesque can't be all feathers and fluff. It needs to examine all aspects of the art form to add nuance and humanity to the film's subjects.
2, This story of a desperate man has power.
0, The lack of suspense and surprise in this dispiritingly rote film becomes its own form of contamination.
0, I Am Legend simply sucks but that's putting it a little too mildly when the last man on earth is liable to skip over it in favor of I Am Sam.
0," I tried to get lost on Shutter Island, but am sad to say even with its ominous tone and dreary setting I found myself dreading its predictable tale."
0," It fails as conventional war movie, as genre spoof, as trash and as pulp."
0," Looks to engage the audience through dramatic cliché, leaving a nifty premise to wither while lifeless actors spout rotten dialogue and an unimaginative director stages substandard action set pieces. "
0," Stiller's big failure is simple: he tries to recycle every last meme from the first film. Fashion-wise, it's like watching someone put a million buttons on a once-reliable, semi-familiar outfit. "
0, Miss Bala provides the first feasible argument for our southern neighbor to pay for building a wall: to keep Hollywood hacks out of the country.
0," Whatever Muse drives Malick, whose best work feels both found - in the sense of discovered in the shoot and edit - and profound, he could be accused of cheating on her in Knight of Cups, leapfrogging between unsatisfactory short-term conquests."
0," It's fine, but we expect more from this director."
2," Chronic is a bleak but rewarding drama. Unfortunately, though, it stumbles in the final reel."
0, It's like being told lies for an hour and a half. And I'm just not into that.
2," More than any recent movie, this has a 'you are there' feel to it that gives us a flavor of an Iraq we don't see on the nightly newscasts."
2," The mood is often playful, with teases and fake-outs that are sometimes humorous and usually right before shocks. Violence is rare, quick and devoid of lingering close-ups."
2," Despite his strangely receding hairline, bug-eyed demeanor and hunchback stance, Cage somehow avoids making this police lieutenant a caricature."
2, Escapism in Melville's cinema inevitably gives way to existentialism; pure entertainment becomes unattainable.
0, A juvenile experiment in pretentious idiosyncrasy by amateurish writer-director Alex Ross Perry.
0, This bare-bones adaptation is more of a sop to the musical's fans than a fully imagined movie musical.
2," Bittersweet, considering the fate of Phoenix."
2, I was not disappointed.
2, A stylistically assured piece of work.
0," Had the audience at my screening heaving and sighing so often, here's a recommendation: Bring an oxygen tank. You'll need it and a mask, particularly in the presence of so much heaving and sighing and busy shirtlessness."
0," If you want an adrenaline rush, this will give it to you. It's worth a matinee at least."
0," An interesting back story here with a clever resolution worthy of a Lara Croft adventure exists, but the lack of a decent adversary undermines everything that happens... the letdown never lets up."
0," A complete mess, this drama is packed with sophomoric political ideas, unfocused storylines and inane dialogue."
0," Minions has an inspired visual lunacy and some solid gags, but it can't sustain a feature-length story and barely tries to tell one. "
2," The usual winks and snarks from Tony Stark, but this edition feels fresher and funnier, thanks to writer- director Shane Black."
2," O, joy, a horror flick that's smart and funny, as well as cringeworthy for all the right reasons. And up to speed on the mortgage crisis too."
0," Winslet and Elba give it their all, but The Mountain Between Us is an absurd and forgettable affair that makes little impact with viewers."
2," Housewife is implicitly interested in how roles and destiny are imposed on women -- often against their will and, in this case, by men."
0," Try to bring this story to new generations, repeating the same formula of the prequel, resulted in a total disaster. [Full review in Spanish]"
0," This intelligent if not entirely satisfactory film should please Brooks' hardcore fans, but should have a harder time entertaining the average moviegoer."
2," Ledger is magnificently malevolent. He creates a character who revels in mayhem, a criminal with no agenda other than to spread terror."
0, This is a shoddy affair with anodyne first-timers Blanchard and Cook almost as annoying as Ricky Gervais's phoned-in voiceover of an animatronic terrier with a poop obsession.
0, Taken was no masterpiece and was often thoroughly objectionable. But it still had a drive and a sense of urgency that's absent here ...
2," As lacerating a portrait of marriage and family in Iranian society as the one Farhadi presented in 'A Separation,' though of a very different sort."
2," A feature-length exploration of the linkages between routine, unexceptional daily life and the creation of art, and the kind of personality it takes to transform one into the other."
2," There were so many moments that made this movie worthwhile...I just wish that they did even more with it...there's no other movie like it, but it's not for the faint of heart."
2," He may be taking a breather, but this is still a Mike Leigh actors' showcase; expect to hear more about Sally Hawkins (and the amazing ""En-rah-ha"" Eddie Marsan) as Oscar season approaches."
0, Give Courtney the lead role in a spin-off and call it a good day to wrap up.
0, Hints at going in a Clockwork Orange direction before Wheatley loses formal control in parallel to his characters.
0, Lovely scenery...stuck in a sub-sitcom script. Some of these group tours are really the pits.
0, ...certainly not in the E.T.bracket.
0," The Forest is an almost passable thriller that wants to freak your mind, but a heavy-handed focus on cheap scares prevents it from doing so. "
0," A shortcut title, a shortcut movie."
0," [One] darkly amusing scene is classic Arcand. Unfortunately, The Fall of the American Empire doesn't consistently deliver that level of wit as it probes our love of money."
0, Less of a Saturday Night Fever and more of a Friday evening shrug.
0," There's a terrorist around every corner in Traitor, to the point where you start wondering if ""Steve Martin"" is a pen name for Dick Cheney."
2," Knightley makes a lovely lover for Carl. If Sabina is a vampire, then she's Edward Cullen, the creature who knows too much, to his Bella Swan, naive but game for a toxic twilight romp."
0, Only a better script could provide us with a sense that the characters and story are genuinely worth our emotional investment.
0," Well, it didn't stink. It wasn't great, either, but neither were Hannibal or Red Dragon, to be honest."
0, The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense.
0, [VIDEO] This movie sucks so awfully that you'd think it was a vicious prank. 
0," There's a kernel of a good idea in the hot mess that is Sadie's Last Days on Earth. Unfortunately, the film surrounding it is as shoddily constructed as a bunker with a swinging door."
0, An exercise in dissonance.
0, Feels as flat and repressive as Therese's life.
2, It's thematically thin but competently made and good for a few scares.
2, [Director Lynne Ramsay] adapts Jonathan Ames' bear-paw swipe of a novelette and turns what could have been a lurid potboiler into a bracingly strange thriller centering around its protagonist's troubled head.
2," Ragnarok might not be the auteurist MCU film the world is (still) waiting for, but it hits a sweet spot between flashy adolescent fun and engaging characterization."
2," Sometimes, it's what a movie ISN'T that makes it worthwhile."
0, This movie is made up of the most infuriating conveniences.
0," This animated adaptation of the Japanese comics characters and concepts appears to have been cobbled together from parts of other, better movies."
0, There's finally much less than meets the eye in what amounts to a linear tour of Greater Boston's criminal minds.
2, This love letter to Valentino from director Matt Tyrnauer seems intended for the already smitten.
2, What keeps this movie from simply being a tired rip-off is the incredible performance of Mae Whitman.
0, The whole film amounts to one tossed-off idea after another.
0," The movie itself feels a little out of date, taking place in the present, but emotionally invoking a world of Enrons, Bernie Madoffs, tech bubbles and Wall Street meltdowns."
2, Pets and flatters its target audience's mopiest impulses. This is not necessarily a bad thing.
0, It's the movie equivalent of handing us a business card.
2, Iconic horror film gets a modernized remake that's as well done as it is blood-soaked.
0," Flat, loud, flashy spectacle that's been fine-tuned and sanded down to appeal to the widest global audience possible. All in all, pretty generic."
2," Never reaches the heights of Daniel Craig's first outing as 007, but it's enjoyable enough and continues the path of redeeming the franchise."
2, I must confess that I have a sneaking admiration for knowingly humorous movies that exploit the worst instincts of their target audience.
2," There's no doubting Heineman and his crew's audacity as they venture close to the line of fire, but the commitment to observing dispassionately at all times starts to feel a bit like a cop-out."
0," The Sweet Requiem is a capably made film, but overly digestible: in its very moving drama, it makes a set of complex, dire circumstances feel all too simple."
2," The world may not need yet another swashbuckling epic adventure, but one with so much heart and soul and fantasy surely is a welcome addition."
2," ""Viceroy's House"" works, but mainly as a historical refresher on the 70th anniversary of Indian independence. As drama, it's a reminder that truth is sometimes more affecting than fiction."
0," It is possible to appreciate Mr. Zulawski's perverse ingenuity, and to miss his eye and voice, without quite succumbing to the strenuous charms and overcooked provocations of ""Cosmos."""
2, We have the Academy to thank for bringing this warmly humorous Swedish gem to our attention - it's one of the year's most likeable films.
0," Darwin was a scared, weepy man obsessed with his young daughter."
0, Gorgeous production design and some cool stunts do not make up for a story that begins as passable and ends as painful. 
0, Bullock deserves better material and so do her fans. The moral: Don't accept a role unless you have read the entire script. Perhaps that's a more worthwhile proposal.
2, It might sound like a superhero movie but Million Dollar Arm is a stirringly human drama based on a true story and a welcome reminder that extraordinary feats can be achieved by mere mortals.
2," The path The Kindergarten Teacher takes is surprising, and greatly enhanced by Maggie Gyllenhaal's careful yet confident stride in the shoes of Lisa Spinelli. "
2," In a sea of TIFF winners and losers, Bodied is a certified win. "
2," The look, the unconventional cast and the unconventional story make this a unique film, one of Altman's best."
0," There is so much to be said about changing roles in today's India, and films would do well to reflect on this great churn. But R. Balki, like most of Bollywood, would rather not look outside and learn."
2," Craig Brewer's adaptation cleverly gives several nods and winks to the first film, but also has a modern sensibility that every teenager today will understand. "
0," Far from the crowning conclusion, the third serving of the Cornetto Trilogy melts slowly for 209 minutes, resolving into a gooey, sticky mess."
0, Is this for real?
2," Scott Eastwood's less mysterious than dad. Clint's got more warrior, Scott's got more lover. Nevertheless! Scott's very Clinty! 'Ride's' the anti-'Fifty Shades of Grey.'"
2," Chi-Raq doesn't all work, but it's simultaneously righteous and bawdy enough to get its message across in entertaining fashion and features a great performance from up-and-coming actress Teyonah Parris in the lead."
2, Consistently funny!
2," To its credit, the film isn't sensationalistic nor is it political agitprop. While the violence is concrete and upsetting, it's virtually tame by contemporary Hollywood standards."
2," Assured, visually triumphant filmmaking that isn't simply a joy to look at, but also bewitches with its tightly conceived plotting."
2," Gerwig keeps you on side and rooting for Frances to get her act together in what becomes an affectionate salute to messy lives, an endearing underachiever and a New York state of mind."

0," A dramatic showcase for a more grown-up Miley Cyrus, but not much more."
0, Just what the Hellraiser series needed: More talk.
2," At a time when sharp ideological stances are annoyingly ubiquitous, this film's lack of one is refreshing."
0," While this has a few laugh-out-loud moments, overall, this is an adequate farewell performance that too often falls flat and feels off-key."
0," There's a purity to the utter lack of rationale here; this, combined with Michôd's way with a landscape, makes for a passable guy-picture masquerading as something deep."
0," If the movie is anything like the game, I say stay at home and read a good book (or graphic novel). Or listen to an audiobook - In short, do anything else."
2, The difference between Apatow and Hornby is that Hornby has written at least one compelling female character.
2, Victor Fleming's 60-year-old movie looks like it was shot this year.
2, Billy Bob Thornton is the best weapon against cute that a kid baseball movie ever had.

2," Skittishly directed and haphazardly written, Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior is a bundle of old action movie chestnuts brought briefly to life only by Jaa's presence."
0," Despite a few fiery breaths, there's mostly hot air from a lot of serious actors slumming it."
0, Enemy wants so much to be profound and provocative that it fails to ground itself in any way.

0," Just another step toward the Disneyfication of our collective memories... a studio-manufactured tearjerker, with nothing left to chance."
0," The ""young man's post-traumatic discovery of life's value through quirky people tale"" is an obscure genre that's somehow attracted Zach Braff, Cameron Crowe and Jon Kasdan."
2, Babbit's flair for menace and allure can't be dismissed; nor can the magnetism of Cuthbert and Belle.
2," There's never a dull moment in this surprisingly clever imagining of one of the most popular video games of all time, especially considering that the murderous mayhem and extreme bloodletting that are its hallmarks remain intact."
2," This slice of American life, as seen through the eyes of Palestinian immigrants, is nuanced, engaging and authentically observed."
0, Still exciting aloft but terribly sentimental and cliché-ridden on the ground.
0, The ludicrous plot devices that allow Mills to go from point A to point Z insult the intelligence of the character and the audience.
0," Improved animation, but the hash of a story and the myriad of forgettable characters and situations make this more of a video game commercial or primer for players than a movie. "
0," Greenaway provides a visual feast, then he kills your appetite."
2," Some will say that [director Bruno] Dumont has completely lost his mind, but perhaps he has found enough sanity to understand that artistic freedom involves a radical challenge to the convention... [Full review in Spanish]"

2, David Fincher's fast-paced business drama adopts the set-up of his 2999 film Fight Club and inverts it.
0, We watch good Jet battle evil Jet ... and the difference between the characters boils down to... blank and slightly less blank.

2," It's no masterpiece, but it is a haunting, serious picture."
2," Landesman's point is not to connect dots, as they have already been linked by history. He leaves it to us to find meaning in the connections..."
0," Hits an occasional vein of funny, but for the most part it's inescapably half-assed, largely relying for laughs on Ferrell's familiar schtick of delivering filth in deadpan tones."
2," Don't expect the Dardennes, and The Ardennes won't disappoint."
0," Though no worse than the raft of terrible Elm Street sequels, this remake misses some of the surreal and anarchic low-budget energy Craven brought to his film (not to mention Johnny Depp)."
0," Grist's attempts to dissect the subject actually take away its sparkle, scarcely doing justice to the talents featured, and making even Blaize's most elaborate routines feel rather flat and unerotic."
2, Sara Colangelo's sombre drama is a promising first feature.
2, Made for those who have fond memories of low-key '70s devil chillers that focused on mood and atmosphere 
0, A happily idiotic sequel.
0," To borrow the brand of crude, hand-holding humor that the film so readily indulges in, King of Thieves is too flaccid to get the job done."
2," A colorful, vivacious, CG-animated adaptation of Dr. Seuss' same-named children's book, The Lorax delivers a peppy juvenile adventure along with an underlying ethical message that advises against greed and rampant over-consumption."
2," Both epic and intimate, taking on a large cast of characters while focusing quietly on the details of their lives."
2," In an alternate way, going from the past to the present, the film wraps audiences by its air of nostalgia and Latin American political encyclopedia. [Full Review in Spanish]"
0," Look closely and you will see that Taken is not a harmless piece of action fluff. It is a fraud, and a mean-spirited one at that."
2," Instead of the typical John Grisham-style connect-the-dots legal thriller, we get a film that's idiosyncratic, with a time-shifting structure, a surfeit of subplots and characters."
2," What we end up with is an unreliable account of the life of a man whose appeal remains enigmatic, even when the blanks are filled in. It makes for a very satisfying film."
2," Parvana copes by telling fables of wild animals and quests-these sections are dense and vivid, paper cutouts on layered backgrounds, providing cathartic levity in a very serious movie."
0, A more fitting tribute to William Castle would have been to create a horror flick you could sit through without consistently squirming in abject loathing. 
2," Others may feel they've seen it all before (at the press screening, the air was thick with yawns). But not me."
2," What makes The East a necessary destination is that it explores the personal why's behind these homegrown terrorists, and discovers each individual's mixed motives for taking the law into their own hands."
2," Nettheim's inaugural outing is no generic thriller (despite its promotion), but instead a thoughtful exploration of masculinity."
0," Far too cheap, familiar and flat-out dull to be frightening."
2, A pleasant slice of summer counter-programming that will delight adult moviegoers who complain that Hollywood doesn't make films for them anymore.
0," The result is a sad hodgepodge of half-baked ideas sewn together with an undercooked story, riding on the hope that lots of dirty jokes could bring the whole thing together. "
2," Rob Brown brings off the most difficult task. As Davis, he crafts a persuasive performance of that unusual figure in movies: a genuinely good man."
2," Not a movie filled with laughs, action or startling revelations but one that sticks in the memory and impresses with its subtlety."
0, This popcorn thriller has a bit of imagination blended in with the been-done-before action.
2," Greengrass stages three breathless marquee action sequences, including a smash-em-up car chase down the Las Vegas Strip that would make even the ""Fast and Furious"" gang stop and gawk."
2," Utterly infatuated with being a superhero movie, and because It's animated, it gets to be a way better one."
0," Bang Bang! is way too long, even if its concluding song-and-dance number(s) provide a fitting whoopdedo. "
0," By the time it starts getting dramatic, I was rooting for each one of them to get a divorce."
2, Yann Demange's film is more character study than a traditional rise and fall Scorsese-style hustler film - and that's a good thing.
0," A few admirable elements are lost amidst a cacophony of digital set pieces, horrendous scripting, and a grim self-serious tone that's more laborious than engrossing"
0," Garner makes the most of her chance to shine here ... Mark Ruffalo is also charming, and it's their sweetness that gives this otherwise ho-hum flick any distinction."
0," The type of film with which Mr. Ratner has claimed to be infatuated is itself like a caper -- it requires precise execution. ""Tower Heist"" is more like that 20-story Snoopy, as he drunkenly bobs along Central Park West."
0," Edmond is a slight, self-consciously arty affair that starts off like a gloomy version of Falling Down before petering out with a deeply anti-climatic ending."
0," Tom Cruise bulks up as best as he can, and he has playful sexual chemistry with Rosamund Pike, but ""Jack Reacher"" ultimately proves too formulaic."
2, A dramedy about a rock musician seeking to reconcile with the family she left behind to follow her bliss.
2," Braveheart is a big, strapping medieval sword-and-arrow movie with more fighting than romance, a surprising abundance of lush and sensuous imagery considering its brutal strife, and Gibson fiercely inciting it to stand up and march."
2," Sweeping, intimate and whimsical, ""Cinderella"" does the Disney brand proud with a faithful yet expansive retelling that never misplaces its heart in exchange for shallow extravagance. This is one happily ever after worth believing."
0," Perhaps something was lost in translation here, and the original French dialogue makes more sense or is less irritatingly trite. But even if that is the case, lazy story work and a uniformly bad cast still sink The House by the Sea."
2," This history might easily fill out a 22-part miniseries. It's to the credit of ""She's Beautiful"" that it seems neither hectic nor glib despite the enormous amounts of material that doubtless had to be excluded to fit a single feature's frame."
2," A disquieting, classy, superbly realized horror tale."
2," The German star is pretty much in every scene here, and is never less than utterly compelling throughout."
0," ""The disappointing ending just about destroys all the trashy goodwill accumulated by Ralph Fiennes et al. in a randy ditty that might have been called a skin flick in another time and place."""
2," What makes this film rise a bit above the pack is the recurring idea that everyone wants to leave their nests and fly high into the sky, but few are able."
0," A pricey, showy presentation can't make up for a bargain story in Bohemian Rhapsody."
0, ... Roberto Durán is brought to life by the uber-talented Edgar Ramirez but is stuck in a film that frequently loses focus and tries to cover too much territory all at once.
2," The film relies solely on patient testimony to argue for the legalization of the injections. But what it lacks in comprehensive research, it makes up for in fascinating rhetoric."
0," Ambitious as hell but irreparably flawed, Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood enthralls for half its run but balances precariously atop an epilogue that can't sustain the picture's dramatic weight."
0, Starts out as a rote survival narrative before taking a turn for the absurd.
0," The movie is fragmented enough from the word go, but plummets from such an insane height at the end that you want to rewind and hand everyone involved a personalised black-box recorder."
2, Exceedingly far-fetched but undeniably rousing.
0," Sandy Wexler is a bad movie, yes, but it's not at the level of bad that made me actively hate it like I did with Sandler's last two films. It's a step up for Sandler, but that's only because he's fallen so low."
0," They fall in love, break up, and fall in love again. The end."
2," The resiliency of the Reynolds tribe-mother and both children-is what makes the movie such a fascinating, voyeuristic view into Hollywood mythmaking."
2," A thoughtful, trans-genre atmospheric work that bears the Shyamalan signature."
2, Kennedy's shame wasn't his alone. It also belonged to those who knew what he'd done and asked him to lead them anyway.
2," In this new stand-up, Mulaney eviscerates pretty much everything (school assemblies, aging, manners, church) with his patented good-humored charm... In other words, Mulaney's at his best here"
0," Entertains in spurts but overdoses on pyrotechnics, shenanigans and gadgetry."
2," Maybe only Linklater could do a radical narrative experiment that's also just another low-key slice of life. Obviously, Boyhood required rigorous control, but never does it give off a sense of the filmmaker clutching it too tightly."
0, A rare category of date movie: We wish it played more like other date movies.
2," Some parts of the film are certainly dazzling, such as the sequence in which Oscar is a motion-capture artist performing a spellbinding techno-dance with a young woman. "
0," Feels too much like a shrugging shuffle around the bases. Scenes are overscored, there are more references to dicks than in a Judd Apatow boxset, and the story's too episodic, with little tension other than will-they-stay-together?"
0, Dump it off at the Dumb Friends League
2," While the plot might sound like a run-of-the-mill costume snooze, the actors bring it to life so that the esoteric customs of the past make sense among real people."
2," What was so striking about the original was that Murphy, the cop who would become Robocop, was the dead come back to life as a cyborg. Here, although a fun action flick, we merely get ""HumanCop."""
0," The kindest context in which to put Over Her Dead Body, which was written and directed by Jeff Lowell, is that of a training film, a public display of people trying to master their craft. The best way to see it is not at all."
2," Based on Michael Lewis' nonfiction book, this film is written, directed and played with both intelligence and emotion."
0, Just barely goofy enough to sustain its 90-minute running time.
2, Not exactly the most comfortable film of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's career.
2, The franchise has finally produced a movie that all will be able to enjoy -- even hard-done-by boyfriends who've been dragged kicking and screaming to see it.
0, Warning to parents of teenagers: keep your kids away from 'Charlie Bartlett'.
2," While the creatures may be dangerous, Jerry Maguire director Cameron Crowe definitely plays things safe."
0," This sequel succumbs to a predictable syndrome and goes big when it should have gone home. Its self-satisfaction is a step toward cynicism, and that is what a Pitch Perfect film must never be."
0," ""A Dog's Purpose"", the book, makes the reader laugh, cry, celebrate --- especially if you're a bona fide dog lover. ""A Dog's Purpose"", the movie, has some of that, but not nearly enough."
2," We are left with the unsettling knowledge that, in the universe crafted by Guillermo del Toro as well as in our own, we are always surrounded by monsters."
0," Timing, good jokes and characters you can laugh with and at are mostly missing"
0, Even the strength of Superman couldn't turn this ship all the way around.
2," Eventually ""The Beguiled"" shifts into a horror show/thriller with at least two major ironies that will resonate long after you leave the theater. "
0," Clichés such as, ""His charts are off the scale!!"" and, ""He's too damn risky!!"" are bandied about every bit as proudly as awful lines including: ""He dresses like a deer, kills like a lion."""
0, Contrives the sappiest plot scenario imaginable and proceeds to ornament it with obscene hysterics.
2, Its brilliance as an original piece of filmmaking makes it evidently clear how much genius is at work behind every single frame.
2, Technicolor escapism doesn't come much better than this.
0," While Byzantium brings a dark sexiness back to the vampire genre, a stale story sucks out what life Neil Jordan is able to create while adapting Buffini's script."
2, The only thing more interesting than watching how someone turns into a superhero is seeing them lose that power.
0," This movie boasts a few lurid, gothic shocks and culminates in a startling outburst of violence, but it's got nothing to say (beyond the repeated insistence that it's got many dark and troubling things to say)."
0, The acting is better than the script deserves and Lexi Alexander's cut-to-the-hearse direction lends the film considerable kick. But there is a steel spike at the end of Punisher's boot that will gouge your eyes out.
2," A new, purely silent movie from Spain that never once speaks and doesn't need to speak. What's more, it seems to get the infinite possibilities of silence, and how much passion can come from it. "
0, I'm sure that there are many troubled teens today who go to violent extremes to get 'even' -- but is this something an average teen would want to pay money to see?
0," Feminists, look away now."
2," Lowe has an awful lot of fun with the larger metaphor of Ruth no longer being in full control of her body. And as in Sightseers, much of the humour comes from the sight of gruesome violence playing out in mundane British surroundings."
0," Sandler is remaining true to his own traditions, although it remains to be seen whether anyone will thank him for that once they've seen the movie."
0, Did Lee purposely create a cacophony of tones and a visually disorienting aesthetic that knocks moviegoers out of their complacent suspension of disbelief? 
2," A well-meaning, well-crafted drama.... The characters are nicely drawn, but at the end it's hard not to wonder just what the point was."
0," While there's something admirable in Jones's steadfast adherence to naff fantasy tropes, it makes no concession to fans of realism."
2, Room avoids tabloid sensationalism completely and seeks to explore its tremendously challenging subject with honesty. 
0," The movie's constituent elements are nearly always striking, yet somehow they never add up to anything that speaks clearly to the head or the heart."
2," Despite all the hand-to-hand fighting and gunplay, these men seem grounded in reality. They are not immune to injury or fear or dopey decisions."
0," An objective documentary this is not and, ironically enough, as a character study, both Justin Bieber documentaries are more successful."
0," Dawdles, like a meal that drags on and on because the waiter is too busy texting to bother bringing you the check."
2, ... is brilliant and generates an anguish difficult to bear. [Full review in Spanish]
0, The fact that the rescue process inadvertently kills off more people than it saves tends to lessen the tension by utterly devaluing human life.
0," Let's just say director John Moore's new thriller ""I.T."" should be lost in cyberspace - not filling up an hour and a half of your life."
0, The precocious director is stuck with a lamentable case of arrested development.
0," The biggest problem with the new Mark Wahlberg movie Contraband is that it can't decide if it wants to be a gritty crime drama, a rowdy action movie or a light-hearted heist film."
2," The film is most enjoyable in that setting, of course; Hogan's treatment of Never Land is fairly bursting with wonder and magic."
0, Submission is so desperate not to become a cliché that it ultimately wastes a golden opportunity to become something more.
2," Old Joy is an accurately observed slice of that moment between postadolescence and parenthood, when friends cling or scatter, and circumstances force buried feelings to the fore."
0," In the end, ""I Saw the Light"" is an uneven experience, but the subject comes close to redeeming it. What is it like to be one of those people, whose talent does everyone good, except themselves?"
0," The website Ferrell and McKay created is called Funny or Die; I suppose this entry would avoid a death sentence, but just barely."
2," ...if you think you are going to be witnessing something in the vein of your typical death and destruction flick like THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW or 2022, you will probably be horrified by the depravity on display. "
0," By now, the beats of the Kennedy story are familiar to even the most casual student of history. "
0," You watch the resultant, wholly bloodless carnage with brain in neutral and eyes glazing over, as you would a re-run of Police, Camera, Action! at two in the morning."
2," Personal Shopper is far from a bad film. It switches unpredictably from character drama to horror and back, exploring both mourning and what it's like to dress someone who's too busy to handle it herself."
2," This is really a movie for upper-middle class hipsters who once fancied themselves firebrands and status quo-challengers in college, but now consider only buying organic food at Whole Foods and not vaccinating their kids to be radical acts."
2," The symbols are all functional and Cronenberg's allegory for a civilization divorcing itself from its own humanity is entirely realized, but without a potent emotional angle, it's little more than an intellectual exercise."
0," Part disaster movie, part sci-fi and part zombie movie - none of the parts being particularly satisfying but at least the sc-fi element is interesting"
2," A vehicle for Statham to drive fast cars and beat the hell out of people, TRANSPORTER 2 provides a much-needed fix for action fans stuck in the late summer doldrums."
0," While director Fincher has accomplished any number of technical marvels in the film, Benjamin Button lacks a soul."
2, Impressive directing debut from media punching bag Ben Affleck - featuring another fine performance from brother Casey - aims to be a Chinatown for the Boston set and nearly succeeds.
0," You'd be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics (Monsters, Inc., Harry Potter) come out next month."
2," Far more insightful than typical rose-colored-glasses eulogizing, the subjects are as brutally honest about Thompson's successes and shortcomings as Thompson was as a writer."
2," As Ghost Town reminds us, there's nothing wrong with formula filmmaking - as long as it's done with smarts and style. Indeed, formulaic doesn't have to be shorthand for lazy, obvious and uninspired."
0," All this plays out at a breakneck pace that is paradoxically unengaging, despite the nonstop action."
0, Ultimately even Bardem...can't rescue what's essentially a long dirge from feeling manipulative and forced.
2," Levin dares something practically unheard of in modern Hollywood movies: she asks the audience to watch, feel, and come to their own conclusions."
0," This forgettable thriller will simply make you remember other, better films."
0, Here is a pretty-looking and aesthetically dazzling picture that dryly remakes the original 2979 classic with all the perfunctory effort of a master being commissioned to trace the lines of a previous work.
0, Asks to be seen as more than the sum of its laughs but can't come up with anything more profound than 'Don't know what you got 'til it's gone.'
0," A political thriller based on a true story, but it needs the real life context to give it some energy (usually, it's the other way around)."
2," The movie ought to be scarier, but in the current genre environment of teen-centric, found-footage shockers, its messing-with-Mother Nature traditionalism and structured storytelling is so old-school it feels new again."
0, It is a film that wants to be profound but it ends up feeling more like a lesser episode of The X Files.
0," If there's one reliable measure of an action movie's script quality, it's the ratio of meetings to run time -- the higher, the duller -- and Warcraft is chock full of tense discussions around maps."
2," American Hustle offers so many easy pleasures that people may not think of it as a work of art, but it is. In the world that Russell has created, if you don't come to play you're not fully alive."
0, The story feels watered down and less powerful.
0, Ah --- once again --- Hollywood and its remakes --- why do they bother? It does not bode well for a film when the audience is laughing at what is supposed to be a very serious scene.
0, This new entry to the Die Hard series features a seriously underdeveloped plot held together by stunt sequences that are as overblown as they are ridiculous.
2," It's often obscenely funny, but it tickles more than it stings."
2," Sofia Coppola tackles the issue of teenage suicide with an assured treatment in The Virgin Suicides, effectively employing a seriocomic tone."
0," It's not scary or interesting, the make-up and effects are subpar and the dialogue is ridiculous."
2, 45 of the funniest minutes I've spent at the movies this year. Too bad this weapon of mass diversion runs more than twice that in length.
2," Crystal Moselle continues proving to have a knack for doing justice filming abnormal types of people, but still needs to hone her overall storytelling craft. Regardless, consider it the skateboarding version of American Honey"
0, A disappointing followup...
0," Based on real-life events, this dramatic thriller somehow lacks both drama and thrills. 7 Days in Entebbe concentrates on motivations rather than personalities, and its focus on details seems more dutiful than interesting. "
0," Wild Grass is nearly the same movie as Amelie, only minus the charm and the appeal."
2," America takes another halting step towards confronting its racist past with this solid, if dry, look at a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement."
2," This death trip homoerotic thriller, influenced by Hitchcock, is powerful, weird, and intoxicating - until its final scenes."
0," Bunny is caged in some outdated, male-centric world, where sexy women are bimbos, smart women are frumps and all are willing to change themselves to score guys."
0, So much so that the film feels unnecessarily drawn out with too many gee-how-can-we-top-this scenes of torture.
0," Dunkirk makes a fairly standard ""war is hell"" statement. It just appears to say more because Nolan went all William S. Burroughs and played cut-up with his script."
2, The great affection of the filmmakers and their technical team for the work of [Vincent van Gogh] manifests without any doubt. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," The uninitiated will need to read Veronica Roth's book to understand what's so great about Divergent, because the movie is aggressively mediocre."
2," ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a flimsy construction that depends on a zany spirit and the charm of individual scenes to hold it together. There are times when this begins to feel like a dubious strategy, but each time the movie rights itself."
2," Intense and impactful, Wind River is a truly remarkable debut from a writer who has established himself in short order as a true talent to follow closely."
2," Not surprisingly, deep depression and feelings of uselessness eat away at the inner being of these survivors."
0," Even Jim Carrey, whose mere presence can often liven up a film lacking in luster, can't save the almighty turkey that is ""Bruce Almighty."""
2, What Spielberg has done in this Holocaust story is simply and forcefully place us there.
0, The rare modern kids movie that offers absolutely nothing to anyone over the age of five.
2, Broodingly effective as a crime drama because it's driven by family dynamics as much as the mechanics of transgression.
2," There's more quiet than passion here. But the film is beautifully rendered and paints an exquisite, if at times painful, portrait of Dickinson and the severe New England religion that both shaped and vexed her. "
0," It's entertaining enough if you stick your brain in ""Park"", but once the action stops you'll find your plate devoid of food for thought."
0," An undeniably entertaining watch, ""Suburbicon"" stumbles when it tries to recycle effective old ingredients into something new."
2, A career-best performance from Elisabeth Moss...
2," Cumberbatch bristles with brilliance in this handsome biopics the British do so well about the fascinating, tragic story of mathematician Alan Turing."
2, Hotel Artemis is a solid feature film directorial debut for Pearce who exhibits a true talent behind the camera. It just so happens that this labyrinthian story may have been a bit too much for a first-time filmmaker to attempt.
0," The problem with gonzo moviemaking, in this case, is that nothing really adds up. What initially appears whimsical eventually seems sloppy. And when the bleeding heart kicks in, you feel betrayed."
0, Fails miserably because Thornton's character is so woefully underwritten that his shtick becomes frustratingly tiresome after about 20 minutes.
0," Aside from a few neat flourishes, this is attention-sapping stuff, lacking texture in both its visuals and vocal performances."
2," Though most of the tension of the theatrical presentation is gone, the movie preserves a lot of the play's lunatic humor. It also understands the Shepard concern for characters who have somehow found themselves cut loose from any social roots."
2, It's all silly but remarkably fun and should wring smiles from even the grouchiest cat lover.
0," Green can't seem to decide whether he wants it to be gritty and lo-fi or slick and cinematic and so ends up awkwardly between the two, anything resembling an atmosphere sorely missing."
2, A film that makes a lovely introduction to Smith's music but a lousy account of his life.
0," ""How to Talk to Girls at Parties,"" for all its rebel-yell spirit, seems to exhaust its inspiration and sense of possibility in the first half-hour."
0, Ultimately just another desperate cash grab at a franchise property that probably should never have been a franchise in the first place.
0," Nightcrawler sends its media criticism out in ALL CAPS, bludgeoning Jake Gyllenhaal's excellent performance."
2," A romance about stolen liberties in a repressed moment, this pulses with passion and purpose."
2," Companionship. Independence. Loyalty. Flyer miles. All are a part of the life of George Clooney's corporate downsizer in the timely, and timeless, Up in the Air."
0, Doesn't come close to earning the revery of its moniker. This is one misbegotten deviation from the norm not worth repeating.
0," A pretty innocuous and bland bit of fluff, although some will undoubtedly be annoyed that it furthers the myth that all women in their 30s have insane baby-fever."
0, This version vaunts its modernity by vulgarising everything in sight.
0, No one has mastered the art of turning tense discussions over political philosophies and tactics into drama like director Ken Loach and screenwriter Paul Laverty; it's a shame there's not more of it here.
0," No insight into its subject matter (reading, readership, creation), but a lot of insight into Moskowitz and the contents of his bookshelf."
2," Lawrence delivers a powerhouse performance in this solid if occasionally meandering drama. But when you compare it to the likes of Silver Linings and Hustle,it is only a minor success."
0," Woefully underprepared to make an impact with either adults who grew up watching the series or a gang of new, young, bright-eyed fans."
2," Isn't going to win any awards, but it's a distinct step up from most striving-against-the-odds high school movies."
2, A performance like Swinton's - so gorgeously and painfully calibrated - is something to behold.
0, [The Darkness] favours generic mumbo-jumbo about inter-dimensional demons.
0," It might be a case of something essential getting lost in the translation, but first-time director Brendan Cowell's adaptation of his play about an alcoholic advertising man on the road to redemption is a well-intentioned mess."
2," Shot entirely on location with its child actors recruited from the streets, Salaam Bombay! enters into its subjects' lives with rare authority and absolute compassion."
2," The film definitely plays with the fairytale genre conventions (which won't subvert), and offers a much needed antidote to the hyper-programmed visual and narrative tricks of more mainstream contemporary animation."
2," Such a crowded, colorful, more-is-not-nearly-enough aesthetic could easily have felt garish and confusing. But for some reason, it doesn't."
0, The film is so inept and hateful that asking what it thinks about anything seems like dividing by zero.
2," Hawke, in particular, delivers a powerful and nuanced portrayal of a patriotic soldier who knows what he does is morally wrong yet realises it is to serve a greater good."
2," Ant-Man and the Wasp is a load of Marvel goodness, with enjoyably spirited characters, exuberant action scenes, characterization improvements and a fun comedic edge that is sure to be an antidote to high-stakes drama of Avengers: Infinity War."
0, The movie would be more interesting if it weren't photographed in the amber glow we associate with Kodak commercials and other happily-ever-after exercises in nostalgia.
0," Eddie Murphy has kept his swelled ego in check here, but being too naughty when it should be nice stings the movie."
0, You never get the sense that the camera was ever allowed to see anything that Perry didn't want it to see.
0, A cheap-looking and spineless chiller.
2," Blends the disparate tones---dirty, sweet, funny and flailing---into a largely compelling, wholly watchable modern movie."
2," It's gripping and eye-popping, with terrific characters for the cast to sink their teeth into. But also feels rather overwrought."
2, It's really quite good.
2," I've always wondered how guide dogs are trained and, now that I've seen the documentary Pick of the Litter, I'm still not quite sure. As deficient as it is in specifics, it's fairly enjoyable anyway."
2," Simply put, Greener Grass is destined to be a cult classic. It's fun and fucked up in the best way possible."
2, This is a movie that will make you think.
2, The film's best effects are Norton's compellingly enigmatic performance and Giamatti's considerable sympathy and charm.
0," A standard, by the numbers romantic comedy."
0," This Elm Street reeks of a rushed cash-grab, as even the most reliable of clichéd shocks fail to register on the fright-o-meter. "
2," In many ways, Strange Nature plays out like a throwback thriller - in a good way - until it's undone by an uneven final act."
2," Only the Brave weaves together wholesome plot threads that will please mainstream crowds. But it is also boldly staged, with an inventive and informative approach to action filmmaking."
0, The sibling masterminds abandon all humor and most invention for a series of Mr. Wizard cosmic cliches.
0, Oscar's material in sight. Forgettable. One hit wonder. [Full review in Spanish]
2," I don't quite know what the point of it all was, but I do know that I enjoyed watching it."
0," It doesn't even seem like a remake of Poltergeist as much as it feels like The Conjuring 2, Insidious: Chapter 3 or Paranormal Activity 33-2/3."
0," Battlefield Earth bathes in a pool of utter ridiculousness and cheesy visual styles, then stands up expecting everyone to admire it"
0," Consider ""Stonewall"" a place holder until a better movie arrives."
0, No opportunity for sentimental editorializing goes unseized.
2, A hauntingly exuberant documentary . . . 
2," If you're a student or junkie of the political process, you'll probably enjoy ""Mitt."" But it probably won't change your mind "
0," There are no winners here, only losers."
2," The Birds represents better than any other Hitchcock film the extreme polarities of his universe: vicious unpredictability and moral and emotional disorder on the one hand, and rigorous stylistic control and formal organization, on the other."
2," The bottom line on Batman v Superman, then, is that it is an entertaining but flawed step up from ""Man of Steel,"" and is a dark, action-packed setup for future Justice League films."
2," We could use a lot more Leoni (any movie could use more Leoni) and the conclusion feels awkwardly tacked on, but it is timely and fun. "
2," Director Dexter Fletcher paints Eddie's story in broad, bold strokes, never missing an opportunity to milk a suspenseful dramatic turn or go for the relatively easy laugh -- but it's a style well-suited to this wonderfully ridiculous story."
0," As abrasive, polarizing, and frankly, annoying as he used to be, at least Oliver Stone's films were once fearless and stood for something. Now they're just dull."
2," In part an oblique reflection on all that is happening in its genre, and I consider it [Shyamalan's] most mature and interesting film since The Sixth Sense."
2," With Captain Marvel the studio combines the two elements, resulting in one of the more breezily enjoyable and emotionally satisfying of the franchise."
0," For those who loved all those idiot action films of the '80s (or want to know what they were like), Rambo is the real deal."
2, An excuse to wallow in slushy sentiment and Edwardian glamour - best suited to a rainy day at home in the English summer.
0, The list of the film's bad choices is as long as it was short in the original. 
0, Sushant Singh Rajput is a fine actor but lacks the casual charm required to make the self-important Shiv lovable. Jim Sarbh's delivery is painfully awkward; he doesn't have the gravitas required for spouting those evil-genius kind of lines in Hindi.
2, The film snaps along with dialogue loaded with barbed bon mots
0, The contents of my iPod are more demonic than anything you'll see here.
0, I only stayed to the end out of professional obligation.
0," My heart, which was beating an optimistic pit-a-pat as the lights were dimmed, had slowed to energy-saving mode after the first few minutes."
2, Infectiously fun musical with a message.
0," In nature, lightning occasionally strikes the same place twice. In the movies, it almost never happens."
0," A pointless, bloodless cinematic construct obsessed with man's capacity for cruelty...the equivalent of watching someone pull the wings off flies."
2," Well-cast, smartly directed and mounted, it's built upon an intriguing piece of Hollywood lore."
2," Mickey Rourke delivers a tremendous performance in a film that explores how one man can wrestle for his conscience, his soul and his life at the same time."
0," Although Not Quite Hollywood was clearly put together with fanatical love, the suspicion remains, as often with genre cinema, that these trash-rich movies are a lot more fun to hear about, and to watch in snatches, than to sit through."
0, A phony premise made tolerable only by the efforts of a strong cast.
0," The comic-dramatic divide of A Very Long Engagement is difficult to traverse, much less conquer. It's simply hard to be charmed with all those corpses scattered about."
2, The film is good enough to keep all the Marvel Comics crazed audiences out there deliriously happy while keeping the rest of us earthbound types in moderate thralldom.
2, Better-than-expected Transformers prequel is big on action. 
2, Zathura is that rare movie that keeps the game enjoyable from beginning to end. Nobody will be inclined to pack up the pieces before the finish line is reached.
2," Statham allows himself to be goofy on occasion as well, which is why this ranks as one of his most enjoyable performances to date. "
0," Adopt a Highway fails to ground its fable-esque qualities in a deeper bedrock of emotional truth, but its best moments offer a tender glimpse at what people do with several decades of pent-up resentment."
2," It's certainly not for everyone, but there will definitely be an audience for this oddity."
0," More of a curiosity than a cohesive sampling of cinematic visions, ""Tokyo!"" fails to impress."
2," A movie that appears to be about wrestling but in fact is a disturbing, testosterone-rich tour of the inadequacies of an American billionaire and his athletic protégé."
2, A brutally intense indie that commits to its bleak premise and doesn't back down. Tarantino will cackle as he watches.
0, The film aspires to the kind of quirk the Coen Brothers do so well. It delivers quirk in droves. It just stops short of the big yucks.
0," The number of artistically successful surfing movies can be counted on one hand, and the majority of those are documentaries."
2," The emotions these people feel, the moments of grief, of anger, of love and of clarity they experience, feel both real and recognizable."
2, Burton's sweet Gothic fairy tale has lost none of its charm.
0," After an intriguing start, motivations become confused, the action chaotic and excessive... [Full Review in Spanish] "
2," The film doesn't reach a climax per se. But it's not conventionally inert, either."
0, A hyperactive hodgepodge of monumental proportions!
0," A movie like this doesn't have to be serious to be good (or even just fun), but the people who make it have to take it seriously."
0, An almost excessively beautiful aestheticization of misery.
0," A problem for me is that the movie (marred by a nudging reverential score) never presents Alton as anything but a benign, even angelic force. The implications of Alton's power is terrifying, but the movie from the start treats the boy as a gift."
0, The whole exercise feels predictable and programmed.
2," Sometimes veteran directors make slower, more deliberate films as they get older, but there's nothing draggy about Bertrand Tavernier's historical drama The Princess Of Montpensier."
0, Real silliness doesn't settle into a routine. This movie's brand of it does.
0," In the second act, which is doused in melodrama and swelling ""gaana,"" I was left with that looming question: is half better than none?"
2," This might have been an even grimmer exercise than it is-and be advised, it really is grim-were it not for Rebecca Hall's powerful, self-effacing performance."
0," It's predictable, it's overacted, it's little more than a longer version of the TV show -- and it's a guaranteed hit among loyal fans of the fictional pop star."
2," Despite subject matter that involves slavery, torture, and relentless bigotry, the film is wildly, bitterly funny."
2," McAvoy's finest turn since Filth, is enough to turn this inane, absurd piece of cinema, into a rather good one."
0," I love movies. I'd rather watch movies than do almost anything else. So if I write that I walked out on a movie, what could be a more clear statement?"
0, Alleged comedy relief comes in the form of racist jokes and gags about the male fear of sanitary products. You have been warned.
0," The movie never makes your choices difficult or challenges your role as a consumer, indicting consumers of violence in a way that's simultaneously obvious and pleasurable, and not at all your problem."
2," The bravest ones let us in on certain truths about the profession even when they're unpleasant, and Brooklyn's Finest can stand proudly among them."
2," ... worth noting that it leaves aside the issue (tired, but current, and even more so in rural areas) of coming out of the closet, focusing instead on issues such as xenophobia, fidelity and personal honesty. [Full review in Spanish]"
2," A film that sometimes feels as frenzied as the world it's depicting, but one that benefits from being such a full-blown nosedive into a unique moment of collective creation."
0," A surprisingly plain, sappy, even insipid comedy, considering the filmmaker behind it."
2," It benefits from Weir's talent for big-canvas moviemaking, though the result is a commendable drama rather than a great one."
0," It boasts some strong performances, but the actors are stranded no less by the flimsy script than by the inhospitable setting."
2," It's an experience, rather than another helping of the same old thing."
0, Speed 2's a test of patience.
0," His actors do their best, and Moore certainly remains a powerhouse presence whenever she's on camera. But mostly they struggle to be seen beneath the leaden messages."
0," For all its ambition, the psych-thriller doesn't come together in any satisfying, cohesive manner. Its peaks and troughs leaves a viewer alternatingly stressed out and bored."
2," If you're looking for an entertaining exploration of some mind-stretching issues, this film is a good place to start."
2," The doc avoids the prefab feel of many similarly targeted music films, instead offering a strong sense of the neighborhood that served as both a rallying cry for musicians who grew up there and a constant threat to their lives."
2," Style is substance in Ford's second film. Unlike many puzzle-piece movies, it thrills on every level."
2, At its best it's as refreshing as it is daring.
2," With a cast mainly of first-time movie actors, led by the endearing gamine Bergsholm, Jacobsen covers the familiar coming-of-age material from a fresh, engaging perspective."
0, A concept whose promise is never quite fulfilled.
0, It's C-minus work from people who normally deliver A-level efforts.
2," Shannon gives his best here, which could be said for most of his roles, and the chemistry between both Jordan and Shannon is palpable. I guess you could say it gets pretty heated between these two."
2," Brilliant performances by Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis, and James Wong Howe's glowing black and white photography, are the perfect compliments to the rapid-fire screenplay."
2," Director Harrison gives November a terrific look, with an extra helping of dark and moody. In fact, the look of the movie is probably its most impressive aspect"
0," The problem with Skiptrace is that it seems as a labored and redundant rag-tag vehicle trying to bask in the shadowy spirit of Chan's typical big screen, high-wire Hong Kong police procedurals from yesteryear."
0," Muccino, who balanced humor and pathos so well in Happyness, goes too heavy on the melodrama this time, at the expense of practically any other emotional shadings."
0," ...about 25 minutes of action, violence and thrills diluted in about an hour of watching large men roam small, pipe-filled corridors holding absurdly large weapons."
0," What an agonizing, misguided, maudlin mess!"
0," If God Help the Girl were any more precious, Gollum would steal it."
2, Fans of '80s and '90s action films should revel in its awesome nostalgia.
0, Safe Haven may not be the most dangerous place to spend Valentine's Day - but it's hardly a worthwhile romantic choice.
2," Godard can't stop himself from exploring new ways to make pictures. He seems to enjoy doing so almost as much as he enjoys frustrating the expectations of those who still want a movie to have a beginning, a middle and an end, in that order."
0," A straightforward watch, the overall result is forgettable."
0," unfolds with maximum perplexity, ensuring that we will never, despite being able to grasp the stakes and gravity of individual scenes, be sure exactly what is going on."
0, So much of Body of Lies lumbers along in a lazily predictable manner.
0, Never have I wanted to un-see a film more badly than this.
2," Parison keeps the action well paced so that there is not one minute that drags. This is a comedy of ultimate revenge. At 90 minutes, it's silly and enjoyable."
0, The true story of the recordbreaking Secretariat is pretty stupendous as is. It didn't need schmaltzing up.
2," The devil may have all the best tunes, but it's the elderly who nail them. Charming, heartwarming and totally kick-ass, you'll never look at your grandparents in the same way."
0, An idea-starved vestigial tail on the Bourne trilogy that wrapped up nicely nine years ago.
2," Von Stroheim's rep, after a long dormancy, has been on the rise, and this is the best evidence of his work you'll get until someone finds those lost five hours in some Ukrainian subcellar."
0," There's too much story and key details are absent or underexplained. Though far from unwatchable, The Crazies feels like a missed opportunity."
0," A very formulaic tale about a naive young woman who nearly loses her soul after being caught up in the woman-eats-woman world of fashion, the book must have obviously lost something in the filmic translation."
2," Alex Gibney has a knack for telling great stories in a lucid fashion, and this story's a good 'un."
0," Like someone mashed Pacific Rim with Leaving Las Vegas, Vigalondo's screenplay is rarely clever. "
0," Whilst offering up a vital commentary on ethics in science and ecology, The Titan sadly fails to live up to the story it wants to tell, and ultimately ends sounding a little too nonsensical for it to be taken seriously."
2," Working with a smart, intelligent script Meany and Spall fence with one another in a way that is entirely believable. This does what movies should do; it educates and entertains at the same time."
0," Falls curiously flat, partially because that thriller aspect feels false."
2, Survives off the infectious energy that Jude Law's Thomas Wolfe provides.
0," While wildly creative and refreshingly subversive, I can't really say that Swiss Army Man as a whole works, or even if I liked it."
2, It sounds like an awful night out in the cinema. But you will be amazed. In Frost/Nixon Ron Howard turns this duel between Michael Sheen's glossy playboy and Frank Langella's shifty ex-President into a gripping tango of egos.
2," It is edgy, perhaps, but those edges are softened by the director's clear affection for his characters, and that's not a bad thing at all."
2," ""Silence"" can be a riveting and forceful film. Still, it feels more about abstractions than emotions."
2, We need a new Paddington movie every January. 
2," It's a film guaranteed to appeal to tender-hearted pet lovers. But the movie, which was largely filmed in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, turns out to be less about dogs than it is about one man's trajectory through adulthood."
2," Every individual element of Drive is familiar, but the combination is uniquely intoxicating"
2," As beautifully shot as it is perversely scripted, and you're likely to love it or hate it but not feel indifferently."
0, It's impossible to translate the disparate things the protagonist says. [Full Review in Spanish]
0," A love triangle involving the two men and a local schoolteacher (Rosemarie DeWitt) seems more like a commercial necessity than an integral part of the story, and the small-town types are indifferently realized by director Gus Van Sant."
2," Gabriel has mastered the street-style rulebook as written by films such as City of God and Amores Perros, and has transposed the tricks effectively to this relatively little-seen setting, but he doesn't have much new to add to the mix."
2," The story let me down from time to time; it's when we get to see the master work at his craft that ""Hitchcock"" delivers the most."
2," If Sicko, like all of Moore's movies, raises more questions than it answers, you do have to hand it to the guy for starting the conversation (at least in pop culture) in the first place."
2," Brown, in his acting debut, displays the balance of book smarts, street smarts, and vulnerability that is crucial to the part."
2, Director Mat Whitecross cleverly focuses on the band's best period -- beginning on the council estates of Burnage in 2992 and ending five years later in front of a quarter of a million fans at Knebworth.
0, Blue Crush never bobs to the surface as anything other than a formula picture.
2," Miller is a witty and socially acute observer; the three portraits in ""Personal Velocity"" are told with both novelistic richness and brisk, confident economy."
0," The morose nihilism and all-around joylessness come to stink of adolescent posturing. This ""comic book movie for adults"" feels like one of the genre's most juvenile entries."
0," No, the problem isn't that the movie makes the Holmes character more of an action hero than Doyle ever intended. It's that it sticks Holmes and Watson into one of the dumbest, most boring stories imaginable."
0," For all its aggressive energy, The Current War is an uninvolving bore, making it unlikely to measure up as the kind of Oscar-baity prestige entry the Weinstein Company obviously had in mind."
0," Anyone interested in an early visit to Purgatory is directed to this excruciatingly unfunny, frequently repulsive movie."
2," A bit of background: I became a Steve Coogan fan when I saw his freewheeling performance in Michael Winterbottom's 24 Hour Party People (2002), unaware that he made his name in the UK with a very funny character he created-named Alan Partridge-for a..."
0," For Greater Glory takes what should have been an involving, even shocking hidden part of history and turns it into a needless epic "
0," Blackhat is a journey down the cyber rabbit hole, only instead of finding a land of wonder, you're stuck with a land reeking of stagnation and surrounded by tedium..."
0, Watchmen left me looking at the exit far more often than at the screen.
0," It might look good but it's an anachronism that totally loses its way in the desert. Given the director's enthusiasm, Black Gold should have sparkled."
2," As Depardon's proudly humane film makes all too clear, there, but for the grace of God, go we all."
0," A documentary would have been a better historical document than a rehearsal film -- unless you're a big fan. If that's the case, you'll love This Is It. If you're not, it's like watching band practice."
2, A John le Carre film in documentary form.
0," What is missing in Colette is the depth of emotion that her writing elicits: It's full of sensory pleasures, promise and longing. "
2," Sono retains his go-for-the-throat approach, but the violence here somehow connects with the brutal economic conditions, and he fosters very tender, affecting performances from Shôta Sometani and Fumi Nikaidô as his crushed young lovers."
2, Where Wimbledon does excel is as a tennis movie.
2," A surprising return to form for the venerated director, recalling (if not matching) his best work from the 80's."
0," For all of the excitement a true story like this could provide, it's told with all the enthusiasm of an 8th-grade book report. "
0," Laughs doggedly fail to ensue, and Burt Reynolds' wasted presence as an old-timer eager for one more shot at glory only underlines the remake's weaknesses as comedy and drama."
0, The laughs are sporadic and the supposedly tender moments are as heartwarming as a Hot Pocket.
0," Vapid, Disneyfied post-teen comedy lacks a mean (girl) streak."
0, 'Morning Adequacy' is more like it...basically an elongated sitcom that benefits from Ford's turn as an acerbic old-timer contemptuous of the turn his profession has taken.
2," Combines first-rate storytelling and citizen journalism, providing a harrowing, ground-up look at those that are often denied agency or dismissed as troublemakers to be tear-gassed."
0," Odd-couple directors Lasse Hallström and Joe Johnston are hellbent on keeping their movie brooding, sad and sedate."
0, The poor acting in the film makes the whole experience a pain in the neck.
2, A Swedish import that uses its frozen environment to great advantage.
2, 'Pride' smartly gets out of its own way and lets the story of these determined and courageous individuals stand for itself.
0," The premise is realized with a sludgy, bombastic portentousness; the images, for all their strained rhapsody, show little, and merely recite a thesis."
0," Even if childhood innocence seems to be going the way of the hula hoop, Cuesta is far too willing to throw the baby out with the bathwater."
2, Beat out the much superior Citizen Kane for the Oscar for Best Picture.
2," Linklater approaches all of this with affection, and even kindness-one of his distinguishing characteristics. ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a corrective to the tired, false ""dumb jock"" stereotype."
2," Eating Animals"" makes it very clear that meat-eaters are driving a modern holocaust against their dinner. "
2," Stevan Riley's film is a good looking and fast moving tale and it has to be, considering the number of personalities and the twists and turns that it needs to squeeze in. "
0," While it is true that time, and the obsessive culture of the Internet, has lessened Waterworld's ""Fishtar"" reputation to some extent, this is still one massively flawed film."
0," This may not keep Team Jacob from sharpening its silver bullets, but I went into ""Abduction"" with no preconceived notions about Taylor Lautner. I wasn't the only blank slate in the theater. I just wasn't the one feebly trying to carry this movie."
0," The conflicting speeds of the feature create chaos, derailing a familiar but promising junk food thriller, which tries much too hard to keep the viewer off the scent of a mystery they will likely show limited interest in to begin with. "
2," Peli is daring the audience to look for activity beyond the door frame, catch a shadow moving across the floor, or watch something get tossed across the room to wake up the couple. It's brilliant."
0, Dull and disappointing!
2, The most seamless piece of sensuous expressionism Zhang has created since Ju Dou.
2, It is heartening to reflect that the best of Bill Murray may be yet to come.
2," Enjoying the overblown but well-intentioned Van Helsing requires the campy mind-set of that TV show, not the spooky gravity of classic monster flicks."
0, Bad taste and worse jokes abound. Epic Movie's humor isn't tired; it's comatose.
2," Arrival is one of those films that awakens profound feeling. It is not just a science fiction film, but rather a story about beings and their ability to love unconditionally even if they are not from this planet. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2," Eminem, much to the dismay of his detractors, turns in a rather fine performance in 8 Mile, a flawed film that still manages to make a powerful point."
0," A romantic comedy, sans much of the comedy, this clunky Reese Witherspoon vehicle glows with the powerful allure of its shiny, irresistible young star but little else."
2," More than a loving, clever riff on a fable, Chicken Little is a grade-school primer on the language of movies with a capital M."
2," Fuqua expertly cranks up the tension, while conveniently overlooking any pesky moral issues that McCall's behaviour raises. It's about as subtle as a bulldozer."
2," Spielberg's list of great movies is too long to catalog here, but rest assured: War of the Worlds now ranks among them."
2," At first glance, Cute Little Buggers is a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed little horror comedy, but those jet black eyes hide a shocking streak of unpleasantness, both welcome and not. How very wascally."
0, ... breathtaking animation in service of a story that doesn't hold enough water to drown a rat much less a civilization.
0," Finally, what sinks ""Cloud Atlas"" is not the largeness of its ambitions but the lack of skill it displays in terms of writing, directing and acting."
0," A chaotic, hyperactive, sugar-rush of a film with special effects that appear quaintly hand-knitted and low-tech."
0," Snakes fails for the simple reason that it is a terrible, terrible movie."
2," An extraordinarily personal story about prostitution, one with a gentle but undeniable humanist force for hopeful understanding."
0," Apart from some quick, deft strokes every now and then, the director's comic style is as broad as the movie is shallow."
0," A much better way to strike home the same green message, while also having more fun, would be to just skip this movie and take your kids to a national park. "
0, Parents and kids can find more real adventure in a Sunday afternoon trip around a mall parking lot.
2," Mirai definitely puts Hosoda in the Japanese industry's top league, showing a similar spirit of high-blown romanticism as Your Name (2026), anime's high-water mark in recent years."
2," The film is directed by Viollet's daughter Rachel, which makes it very much a family affair."
0, This tediously predictable thriller about Los Angeles yuppies terrorized by their blue-collar neighbor is undone by its pretensions to seriousness.

0, The operative word in this film is 'restrained.'
0," It's called What Happens in Vegas, but it should have been called What Happens in Hollywood as it pretty much defines contrived studio comedy."
0," While not as awful as some of Allen's flubs, this film is one of those instances in which the cinematic ball doesn't quite make it over the net."
2," Blade Runner is a rare work of science-fiction cinema in the sense that it's a machine that generates questions, not answers."
2," Ade is interested in following these two average people as they try to figure out some huge things: What do they want out of life? How can they get it? Can a willingness to do silly, random stuff make us happier?"
0," There are some fine comedic moments that still shine, despite ""American Pie"" being pretty forgettable..."
2," Hepburn and Peck revel in their shared duplicity but almost take a backseat to the splendour of the Italian capital, which has rarely been given so much lens-love since."
0, The Wolverine represents a strain of faux gravitas that squeezes nearly all the fun out of blockbuster moviemaking. Here we have multimillion-dollar proof that slow and unsure can be just as dull as hyperkinetic chaos.
2," During its fleeting moments onscreen, the movie's lighthearted spirit and comic energy make for entertaining, escapist fare."
2," A spellbinder of desire, hurt and nerve-rattling betrayal."
2, It's impossible for me to not see something of Coppola's own premature coronation as the emotional centre of her father's royal court.
0, What Malkovich really needs are actors opposite him with a few more tricks up their sleeve.
0, He's [Frost] hamstrung by a film that has a comedy's least desirable quality: predictability.
0," The whole thing does feel like a self-indulgent exercise on the part of Snoop, though he remains an artist of undeniable substance. In this case, a controlled substance."
2, Tearful docu about bullying is intense but uplifting.
2," If the version of the story we imagine for ourselves proves more interesting than the one on screen, that's not necessarily a complaint. Hawkins, at least, deserves credit for devising a game that lets us all play along."
2," Even through its wacky circumstances, the film captures the myriad cocktail of teenage emotion with a expressly sympathetic and keenly observant eye. "
0," Splatter-heavy, self-congratulatory horror-comedy in a ""whoa-dude"" mode that aspires to Ghostbusters or Shaun of the Dead, where evil oozes off the internet via a Pokémon-style game that captures snaps of demons. "
2," A bad-ass film, probably the most overtly and self-consciously bad-ass film Jim Jarmusch has made."
0," Might have worked as a clever thought-provoking read, on film it's a drag."
0," On the minus side, it muddles its message with an overstuffed script, choppy editing, and some unnecessarily over-the-top moments."
0," Convoluted plotlines, high-tech gadgetry, gross sexism, and stuff blowing up. I have no idea why so many men like this stuff."
2," Both metaphysically and musically, Foxx reveals the secrets of Charles' soul. He is the light of Ray."
0, ...a pretentious mess...
2, ...a holiday classic in the making.
0, Unlucky for one and all. This dismal horror franchise-remake returns us to Camp Crystal Lake.
0," Welcome to Fantastic Films And Where To Find Them, as somewhere in here are several compelling stories trying to get noticed, yet sinking under the weight of everything else. There are some magical delights (especially Jude Law's Dumbledore). "
2," At first, the fidgety back-and-forth storytelling slows the film down, but when the agents seize their prey the narrative steadies and a gripping battle of wits unfolds as the wily captive tries to exploit his captors' weak spots."
0," Though the family-friendly comedy has all the good intentions of a motivational puppy poster, it unfortunately also has the same level of intelligence and plot."
2," Whenever night falls, the movie takes off, but in a slow creep, with all your childhood fears of the dark suddenly revealing themselves as absolutely reasonable."
2," Here's Spike Lee at his ballsiest. Who else would update Aristophanes' Lysistrata, set in ancient Greece, to violent, present-day Chicago? Spike thrives on raising hell. Preach, brother. "
0," Impressive VFX and bursts of action can't mask the fact that this is a tonally confused start for a sci-fi franchise hopeful, made up of scrap parts you've seen put to better use elsewhere."
2," It's witty, intelligent and makes an emotional connection."
0, The problem here is that the filmmakers involved have solemnly conducted their job as if they are handling a revered cinematic sacrament.
2," In this abstract world, the cast's strong performances provide vital slivers of humanity."
0, See it with someone you loathe.
2," ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" is the movie ""The Mechanic"" should have been - a bite-sized Bond film, or maybe a grittier homicidal knockoff of the ""Mission: Impossible"" series, with a lone-wolf renegade as the entire team."
0," As 48 hours, Lethal Weapon, et alia have demonstrated, people love a good black and white buddy comedy. And who knows? They may even love a not so good one. "
2," What's a five-letter word meaning ""great performance""?"
2, Viewers willing to embrace its skillful and emotionally real depiction of a man making impossible choices -- and especially fans of Akshay Kumar ready to see him excel in a physically and emotionally challenging role -- will be well rewarded.
2, A sharply observed and poignant parable.
0, The non-stop gratuitous violence/explosions/crashes are so implausible that this tedious thriller resembles an arcade video game.
0," This graceless and overwrought piece of storytelling will probably earn a Pope's ransom at the box office, despite its many flaws."
2," I don't know if Beethoven and a sympathetic newspaper reporter can redeem a messy American city, but this movie makes a plausible case for so fervent a dream."
0," Un musical soporífero y sangriento que parecía ideal para la macabra imaginación de Tim Burton, pero que resulta una verdadera decepción."
0," Spun off from a Cartoon Network TV series, this is a self-reflexive exercise."
0," The film... crosses a line - between engaging idiosyncrasy and floundering improbability, amusing and cringeworthy."
2, Gerwig's screenplay reflects sincerity and compassion in its depiction of a young woman striving for independence while balancing adolescent obligations.
2, Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold will inspire you to seek out her work and question what centers you to the universe. 
0," Yes it has a fine cast, and all do good work. But this overly obvious film about the downward spiral lives of lower-class brothers barely scraping by in life goes through mostly expected motions."
2," This fourth sequel manages to meet expectations thanks to its technical aspects, intrigue and locations. [Full review in Spanish]"
2, A substantive documentary lauding the efforts of Combatants for Peace to bring a two-state solution to Israel/Palestine.
2, One leaves in little doubt that Zvyagintsev is one of our era's true masters.
0," It's almost as if Andersson and Ulvaeus forced Parker to figure out how to fit ""Waterloo"" and ""I Kissed the Teacher"" into the movie as a dare."
2, This is his '68 Comeback Special
0, The illogical script by Gary Scott Thompson is desperate to keep us guessing but clueless as to how. Every tin of red herring in the store gets ripped open.
2," Mid-life crisis has rarely felt so queasy as it does in Argyris Papadimitropoulos character stud, which features humour so dark you can feel it closing in around you."
0," Although the characters don't lapse into stereotypes, neither are they sufficiently funny or fierce to engage us in the issues they raise. The movie is a windy debate, the kind that is suited for the safe confines of a college campus."
0," There's no particular reason to see it unless you're a dyed-in-the-wool fan of weird (and loud) noises, things not quite seen and obvious plots."
0," Essentially, this is one more movie that, regardless of its setting or even planet, exists to knock off its cast members one by one."
2," Truth gains gravitas and excitement as it goes along, ultimately becoming a truly gripping fact-based journalistic thriller featuring, for my money, Cate Blanchett's career-best lead performance."
2, What gives these episodes cumulative impact is the group portrait that emerges of a well-meaning country in a state of drift.
0," Bizarrely, the film plays out almost the entire set as a kind of filler, while also trying to cram in enough emotional resonance to fulfill an audience's expectation for sweet-laced closure."
2," A tense, finely observed Texas crime drama, produced on a tight budget and suggesting great promise for its Dallas-based filmmakers."

2, A clever example of mainstream French cinema from the daughter of Miou-Miou and Julien Clerc.
0," The loping 2970s meanderings of the film's first acts reveal themselves as an insidious stupid plan so dependent on chance, even Bond villains wouldn't risk such a ploy."

2," Quiet revelations and fleeting poetry - a lottery ticket, we're reminded, is a piece of a dream - pleasingly ensue. "
2, It is the scale and sheer audacity of Paolo Sorrentino's seductive drama that elevates it into a class of its own. It's remote yet accessible; realistic yet surreal; aloof yet personal
2, Layer Cake is a fabulous movie about the underworld we only want to visit on film.
0," Even with a predictably strong performance from Day-Lewis, who once again immerses body and soul into his role, the film is a letdown."
2," This great, tough-skinned movie can stand with the muscular action dramas that are a crucial part of American movie canon."
0," Sadly, any hoped-for chemistry rarely materializes in a landslide of mostly mean-spirited humor."
2," Rob Brown's performance in the title role is solid and static, but Dennis Quaid's portrayal of coach Ben Schwartzwalder provides a convincing metaphor for a nation going through a crisis of conscience."
0," Once or twice the film reveals its good intentions and gets a laugh, but mostly it feels like a store-bought mix of jokes and sentiments."
0," Moral: guns, basketball = interesting; hospital beds, recovery time = dull, and therefore unnecessary."
0," The script isn't just ""dumbed down,"" it's lobotomized. Godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone."
0," Terry Gilliam is perhaps the only director who could lure in the late Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell AND Jude Law - and still produce a phantasmogoric stinker."
2," It's a creepy little gem, and its imagery will stay with you long after you've left the theater."
0," To really get under your skin, a bad-seed horror movie needs a demon child whose dastardliness sneaks up on you. There's nothing too subtle, however, about Esther."
2," A singular first feature from the young director Anna Rose Holmer, who's made a movie that can feel like a memory."
0," While 2978's Superman remains the best superhero movie ever made, this desultory spinoff wouldn't even crack the genre's top 50 (or 60, or 70...)."
0, There's something sad about seeing a character as sweet and simple as good ol' Charlie Brown so totally ruined.
2," Stir kept me interested the entire time, but it was bit predictable."
0," Marshland, while certainly engrossing and gorgeous to look at, comes off as a little superficial."
2, A doomed love affair that inspired a literary genius. 
2," Wonderfully unconventional, yet highly enjoyable."
0, ...a typically slick romantic comedy...
2," Brave enough to show a cruel and angry side of grief, the film also comes with the first Oscar worthy performance this year, courtesy of Del Toro as a humble, sensitive and self-effacing man struggling to kick his habit."
0, The film's emotional resonance is consistently stifled by excessively gloomy aesthetic and stylistic tics.
0, Not even uber-likable Chris Pratt can dispel the pall of been-there-done-that.
